( discontinued three weeks ago ) ,vitamin supplements ( vitamin e , lysine , co-q10 , vitamin c , calcium ,centrum silver , and primrose oil ) , and no over-the-countermedications.allergies: penicillin , zantac , and comtrex , all of which produceangioedema and tetracycline ( sun sensitivity ).physical examination: vital signs showed a blood pressure of160/110 , pulse 92 , temperature 97.0 ,respirations 16 , and 97% on room air. general: energetic whitefemale in no apparent distress. heent: extraocular movementsintact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , oropharynxwithout erythema or exudate , and no cervical lymphadenopathy orthyromegaly. neck: supple and carotids 2+ bilaterally withoutbruits. cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm at 72 with norubs , gallops , or murmurs. lungs: clear to auscultation andpercussion. abdomen: obese with cholecystectomy scar , chest tubescars , and bowel surgery scar ( right just lateral of the midline ) ,normal bowel sounds times four , non-tender , non-distended , nohepatosplenomegaly , and no bruits. extremities: no cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema , femoral pulses were barely palpable , and distalpulses were 1+ bilaterally on the right and left lower extremity.neurological: alert and oriented times three , cranial nervesii-xii intact , strength 5/5 , sensory intact , deep tendon reflexes3+ bilaterally throughout , and toes downgoing.laboratory examination: sma 7 was remarkable for a potassium of3.9 , bun 14 , creatinine 0.7 , liverfunction tests within normal limits , white blood count equalled7.8 , hematocrit equalled 41 , and platelets were 233. pt was 12.3( 1.1 ) and ptt equalled 30.4. chest x-ray showed status postcoronary artery bypass graft and bibasilar atelectasis but no acuteair space disease and ekg showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 withan axis of 60 degrees , t wave inversion in v2 to v3 with upright inv4 and v6 , and q waves in ii , iii , and f.hospital course: patient is a 61 year old female with peripheralvascular disease and coronary artery diseasestatus post coronary artery bypass graft now admitted forevaluation and management of near syncope. holter monitor haddemonstrated persistence of sinus pauses despite discontinuation ofbeta blocker ( metoprolol ). the patient was admitted forobservation over the weekend. she experienced multiple sinuspauses , particularly at nighttime. the longest pause recorded was4.7 seconds. though she was aware of the irregular heart rhythm ,she never became truly syncopal or had evidence of hemodynamicinstability. she was enrolled in the ecth trial and underwentplacement of a dual chamber pacemaker randomized to the vvir mode on3/23/96. she tolerated the procedure without complication. post-operativechest x-ray revealed appropriate location of atrial and ventricular leads andno evidence of pneumothorax. interrogation of the pacemakerrevealed appropriate response. the patient did well overnight andwas discharged on march , 1996 with instructions to follow-upwith dr. passarella in ten days.disposition: the patient is discharged on march , 1996 in goodcondition.discharge medications: asa 325 mg p.o. q.d. and percocet one totwo tablets p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain.follow-up: she was instructed to follow-up with dr. lafranca onnovember , 1996 at 1 p.m.dictated by: chauncey j. brisby , m.d. gf77attending: dallas w. moors , m.d. mc12xk147/8540batch: 04321 index no. unznf2136n d: 3/27/96t: 6/23/96[report_end]
