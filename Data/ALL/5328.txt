record date: 2094-03-14 youssef nullludlow medical center82 manatee streetpost, in 86454dear dr. null, i had the pleasure of seeing nick hall in wsh cardiology clinic today in follow-up of his recent admission to the icma.  while i know that you are familiar with his history, please allow me to briefly review it for my records.  he is a lovely 53 year old gentleman whose history is remarkable for hodgkins, status post mantle radiation in the early 70's; coronary artery disease, status post-pci to the lad and rca in '90 and '87, respectively, and recently diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer.  mibi done at lmc 1/24/94 showed normal ef without perfusion defects (no scar or ischemia); he exercised 10:30 on a standard bruce iwthout symptoms.  he was admitted 2/94 for elective left upper lobectomy for his squamous cell lung cancer (asa was stopped 1 week prior to surgery; he was not on plavix preop); in pacu following resection, he had a vt/vf arrest and was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have a massive volume of thrombus extending throughout his rca.  after extensive suction catheter use and poba, a good angiographic result was obtained; no stents were placed due to the heightened thrombotic state that he was in.  remarkably, echocardiogram revealed normal lv systolic function, with basal inferoposterior hk noted.  his peak tni was 33.6, his peak ck was 1710, and his peak mb was 87.2.  he had a relatively unremarkable course post-catheterization; plavix initiation was delayed until his chest tube was removed, after which it was started without incident.  he was discharged 2/11/94, and returns today for routine follow-up.  regarding his squamous cell lung cancer, it is my understanding that he had no evidence of metastatic disease and that margins were negative; he is not currently planned for any adjuvant therapy, but will be closely followed.  regarding his remote history of hodgkins, he is followed at rfpc, and is due for an annual visit there in the next 1-2 months.  he has been walking outside for the past ~2 weeks (since the weather improved), walking about 2 miles in around 30 minutes.  he feels well, and has had no problems.  he notes some mild dyspnea with increased exertion (climbing hills), but denies any unusual dyspnea.  he denies chest pain, sob at rest, orthopnea (stable 2 pillow use), pnd, edema, palpitaitons, or claudication.  he brings with him a handwritten record of his recent hemodynamics - his bp runs in the 100-120's/60-80's, with rare systolics in the 130's.  his heart rate has been in the 70-80's.  his past medical history includes: cad s/p imi '88 (totally occluded rca with good collaterals, revascularized with 3 stents to the rca), mi '90 (lad stent), inferior stemi 2/94 as above s/p poba vf arrest in setting of stemi hodgkin's '81 - splenectomy, xrt lul squamous cell cancer s/p l upper lobectomy 2/94 hyperlipidemia (low hdl and high ldl - tried niaspan in the past without much benefit) hypothyroid basal cell skin ca nephrolithiasishis medications include: lipitor 80 mg plavix 75 mg asa 325 mg po qd lopressor 200 mg po bid prilosec 20 mghe has a history of intolerance (dizziness) with lisinopril.his family history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension, but negative for cad.he works in consulting, and travels around the midwest as part of his job.  he is now back at work.  he is married, and lives in lincoln city.  he and his wife have 4 children, ages 15 / 17 / 20 / 24; they have no pets.  he has never smoked cigarettes.  he drinks 3 glasses of wine/week, and a cup of coffee qam.on physical exam today, he has a heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 134/75.  he is a well developed well nourished gentleman in no apparent distress.  his jvp is flat sitting at 90 degrees, and he has no carotid bruits.  his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  he has a regular rate and rhythm with a normal s1 s2, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallups.  his abdomen is benign.  he is warm and well perfused peripherally without significant edema, and with 2+ pt pulses bilaterally.his ekg in clinic today is nsr at 68, with possible lae, a nonspeciifc ivcd, and inferior q waves in iii/f, consistent with an inferior mi.  he has increased voltages consistent with lvh.his recent cardiac tests include:  - echo 2/94 - ef 60%, basal inferoposterior hk, normal atrai, no significant valvular disease - cath 2/94 - right dominant system, patent lad stent, proximal 60% lcx, proximal 90% thrombotic rca occlusion (in-stent) with 100% ostial r-pda thrombotic lesion s/p angiojet/poba with timi-3 excellent angiographic result in summary, this is a 53 year old man who had a vf arrest in the setting of perioperative inferior stemi, status post extensive angiojet and poba of acute in-stent thrombosis of presumed bare metal stents in his rca.  he is asymptomatic from a cardiovascular standpoint, and somewhat remarkably did not take a large myocardial hit from this life-threatening event.  our attention now shifts to the prevention of future events.  given the degree of thrombus burden in his rca at the time of cath, he is someone for whom we would strongly advise lifelong plavix and aspirin.  furthermore, he is not someone for whom i would be comfortable with even temporary discontinuation of one of these agents - we would advise that any future procedures be done on aspirin and plavix.  his blood pressure and heart rate are well controlled on his current regimen, as demonstrated by his home records.  i have taken the liberty today of changing him from lopressor 200 bid to toprol 200 bid to minimize any ups and downs in his beta blockade, but otherwise, would not make any changes to his regimen at this time.  we will check a full set of labs today, but i suspect that no further changes will be required at this time.  given his history of hodgkin's, as well as his known cad, he is clearly at risk for future events, and i suspect that we will take a rather aggressive stance in terms of monitoring for ischemia.  certainly, if he has any concerning symptoms, we would have a low threshold to pursue an aggressive course.  at present, however, i am delighted with how well he is doing.  it was a pleasure to see mr. hall in cardiology clinic today.  i will plan to see him in follow-up in 6 months time, but he knows to call sooner should he have any problems or concerns.  regards,_____________________________________________florence heather gil, m.d., ph.d.cc: dr. nick golden        thoracic surgery         wytheville south hospital        dr. paul reilly        riverside family practice center
