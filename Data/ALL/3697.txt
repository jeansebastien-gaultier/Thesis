admission date :2013-08-24discharge date :2013-08-27date of birth :1987-09-08sex :mservice :trauma surgeryhistory of present illness :this is a 25 - year-old gentleman who is status post a motor vehicle accident in which he was the unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole .he was ejected from the car and landed on his face .extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders .it was presumed high-speed motor vehicle collision .the patient was cmed-flighted to quincy medical center , and he was intubated upon arrival in the emergency department .after initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation , a ct scan was performed .images of his head , abdomen , and thorax were obtained .his injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures , a right temporal fracture , bilateral frontal contusions , and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma .the anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells , presumably caused air in the orbit .past medical history :denies .past surgical history :denies .social history :denies .allergies :denies .medications on admission :denies .physical examination on presentation :initial examination revealed the patient had a heart rate in the 80s , with a blood pressure of 150/80s .he was intubated with multiple abrasions , and severe swelling and contusions of his face .he was not following commands .his boston coma scale was 16 .his pupils were reactive on the right going from 3 mm to 2 mm of light .the response was brisk .on the left , his pupils went from 2.5 mm to 2 mm , also brisk .initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team .he withdrew equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .he withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after 20 minutes in the trauma bay .hospital course by system :1. neurology :mr. roach was transported to intensive care unit from the trauma bay .upon arrival , neurosurgery promptly placed v. holtzen bolt .this allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure .notably , intracranial pressure was 17 when the bolt was placed .during his hospitalization , his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than 20 .to do this , mannitol 25 mg q. 6h. was used .while using mannitol , his serum osmolalities were followed closely .in addition , to monitoring his intracranial pressure , his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at 70 mmhg .a parameter monitor for his neurologic status paco2 which was maintained between 35 and 40 during his hospitalization .mr. roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given fentanyl and / or morphine boluses for pain .neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination .during his hospitalization , two subsequent cat scans were obtained ; one on hospital day two .this cat scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed .after a discussion with both radiology and neurosurgery , the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant , and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition .his intracranial pressure remained stable , and his clinical examination was unchanged .an additional ct scan was obtained on hospital day three .this examination was unchanged from the previous examination .again , his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same , and conservative treatment was opted for .2. cardiovascular :as described in previous section , neo-synephrine and eventually levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than 70 .a pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four .this catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support .please see infectious disease section for more details .3. gastrointestinal :mr. roach was n.p.o. from the time of his admission .a orogastric tube was passed .initially during admission , carafate was given down the orogastric tube .however , on a routine chest x-ray shot on hospital day three , a mediastinum was noted .this raised the question of potential esophageal rupture .gastroenterology was consulted for this .gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status .at this point , his carafate was switched to intravenous protonix and he was strictly n.p.o.4. hematology :throughout mr. richard admission , his hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s .as will be discussed in the infectious disease section , he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis , and his white blood cell count peaked at 23 .mr. roach was on pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis .he was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage .an inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred , as it was felt that mr. roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure .5. endocrine :mr. marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from 100 to 130 using a regular insulin sliding-scale .6. infectious disease :mr. roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers .his blood urine and sputum were all cultured .blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram - positive coagulase - negative staphylococcus which grew from 08-25 .his preliminary cultures including sputum from 08-25 grew escherichia coli .sputum from 08-27 grew gram-negative rods , not yet speciated , and from 08-27 a bronchoalveolar lavage grew 1+ gram-negative rods and 4+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes .throughout this time , mr. richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four , his temperature maximum was 42.2 degrees centigrade .during his hospitalization , his was treated with vancomycin for his gram-negative rods , imipenem , and flagyl .initially , he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain , but his cultures became positive , and his white blood cell count increased .he was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and flagyl .vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture .with a fever of 102 , up to 42 degrees centigrade , aggressive measures including cooling blankets , alcohol swabs , and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down .hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion , paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering .7. pulmonary :as discussed in the infectious disease section , mr. roach developed a pneumonia likely from gram-negative organisms , but most likely from escherichia coli .for this pneumonia , he was placed empirically on imipenem , vancomycin , and flagyl .on hospital day three , mr. roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea .for this , a ct angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism .on hospital day four , a routine chest x-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax .for this , a left #34 caucasian chest tube was placed .on the evening of hospital day four , mr. roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole .urgent resuscitation measures were initiated .the measures included attempts at pacing .epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium .he had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax , cardiac tamponade , and pulmonary embolism .during the resuscitation afterwards , it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest , so initially neo-decompression was attempted in the right chest .there was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression , and a right chest tube was placed .during this time , a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back .a left anterior thoracotomy was made by the cardiac surgery fellow who was present .after 30 minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage , there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors .resuscitation was terminated at 1914 on 08-27 .after the termination of resuscitation , both the anesthesia intensive care unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient 's family members including his next of kin , his mother .permission for a postmortem examination was granted .matthew m.
