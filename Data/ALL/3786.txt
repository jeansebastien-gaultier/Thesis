[name (ni) ] is apast alcohol abuser who now works as a substance abusecounselor.family history:  significant for father who died of amyocardial infarction at the age of 38.physical examination on presentation:  on admission, thepatient was afebrile.  he had a blood pressure of 130/58, apulse of 70, a respiratory rate of 20, and was saturating 97%on room air.  he was in no apparent distress.  he wasanicteric.  his pupils were reactive.  his extraocularmovements were intact.  the lungs were clear bilaterally.his cardiac examination showed normal first heart sounds andsecond heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the rightupper sternal border.  his abdomen was soft, mildlydistended, and nontender.  he had no peripheral edema.pertinent laboratory values on presentation:  he had a whiteblood cell count of 5.6, his hematocrit was 28.4, and he hadplatelets of 101.  he had an inr of 1.9.  chemistry-7 showedan initial creatinine of 4.2 with a potassium of 6.7.  aftergentle fluids and treatment for his potassium, he had arepeat potassium of 5.7 and a creatinine of 3.9.  he had analanine-aminotransferase of 57, his aspartateaminotransferase was 166, his alkaline phosphatase was 101,and his total bilirubin was 3.7.pertinent radiology/imaging:  an electrocardiogram showed anormal sinus rhythm.  there were no peaked t waves.otherwise, his electrocardiogram was normal.brief summary of hospital course:   the patient was admittedfor his acute renal insufficiency.  his lasix and hisaldactone were held.  his hyperkalemia responded well to hiskayexalate therapy.the patient was noted to have some mild periorbital erythemaand edema on the right side of his face.  he was initiallystarted on doxycycline for this presumed preseptalcellulitis.the patient's creatinine did initially improve; however, itstarted to increase again slowly during the course of hishospital stay.  initially, it was felt that the patient'sinitial presentation of acute renal insufficiency wassecondary to aggressive diuresis; however, in the setting ofhis diuretics being held and his continued increase in hiscreatinine, it was possible that he could have the initialstages of hepatorenal syndrome.  the patient has had elevatedcreatinines on previous hospitalizations, presumed to berelated to hepatorenal syndrome.  the patient was started onoctreotide and midodrine.also in the setting of his acute renal insufficiency, histetracycline was held as it was possible that this could be acontributing factor.an ophthalmology consultation was obtained which showed justsome very mild preseptal cellulitis with no orbital signs orsymptoms suggestive of an orbital cellulitis.  the patient'sdoxycycline was discontinued in favor of keflex.the patient did have urine eosinophils and sediment checked.he had bland sediment which was not consistent with an acutetubular necrosis type picture.  the patient was alsotransfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a lowhematocrit early on during the course of his hospital stay.the patient did not have any upper endoscopy as his anemiawas not suspected to be secondary to esophageal varices.the patient's creatinine continued to rise in the setting ofhis octreotide and midodrine therapy.  because of this,albumin 25 grams intravenously once per day was also started.on [2138-3-29], the patient became encephalopathic.  bloodcultures and urine cultures were sent, and he did have anepisode of occult-blood positive stools.in the setting of his encephalopathy, his renal function didimprove; however, he was transferred to the unit for furtherobservation.  a nasogastric lavage was done in the setting ofhis occult-blood positive stool.  the nasogastric lavage wasnegative for blood.  he did have a stat head computedtomography which was negative for bleed.  all sedatives werediscontinued, and he was started on lactulose therapy.  achest x-ray there was negative for a pneumonia.  the patientdid have serial blood cultures done.  he did have a total of[6-26] blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistantcoagulase-negative staphylococcus.  his mental status didimprove on lactulose therapy.the origin of his staphylococcal bacteremia was stilluncertain.  in this setting, he did have a diagnosticparacentesis done which was negative for spontaneousbacterial peritonitis.  the patient was started on vancomycinfor his high-grade bacteremia.  he did have a transesophagealechocardiogram done which was negative for endocarditis.  perthe infectious disease staff, it was recommended that he betreated with four to six weeks of vancomycin from the date ofhis last positive blood cultures which were [2138-3-30].the patient was transferred back to the floor with animproved mental status and improved renal function.  he didwell on the floor.  his hematocrit remained stable.  heremained afebrile on vancomycin.  the patient also completeda course of levofloxacin for his preseptal cellulitis.   forhis preseptal cellulitis, he received a total of 10 days ofantibiotics which included doxycycline, keflex, andlevofloxacin.  the patient did have good nutritional intakewhile on the floor.  his creatinine remained in the 1.6 to1.9 range on the floor and stable.  his baseline creatinineis around 1.  he was not started on diuretics at discharge.a peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed foradministration of intravenous vancomycin for his high-grademethicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia.the patient was seen by physical therapy and was dischargedfrom their service as he had no acute physical therapy needs.the patient did have a candidal infection of his groin areawhich was treated with topical anti-fungal medications, towhich he responded well to.toward the end of his hospital stay, the patient did haveincreased diarrhea.  his lactulose was held which improvedhis diarrhea somewhat; however, he did complain of increaseddiarrhea.  he did have clostridium difficile toxins timesthree days which were sent.  these were negative forclostridium difficile.the patient was discharged on no diuretics; however, thepossibility of restarting aldactone 50 mg will be consideredas an outpatient.  he will be discharged with a total courseof four to six weeks of vancomycin.  the start date on hisvancomycin was [2138-3-30].condition at discharge:  fair.discharge status:  to home.discharge diagnoses:1.  hepatitis c cirrhosis; awaiting liver transplantation.2.  acute renal failure.3.  methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcalbacteremia; on vancomycin.medications on discharge:1.  miconazole nitrate powder applied three times per day asneeded to groin rash.2.  protonix 40 mg q.12h.3.  lactulose 30 ml by mouth three times per day (titrated tofour to five bowel movements per day).4.  vancomycin 1 gram intravenously q.12h. (for a total ofsix weeks); his vancomycin dose will be changed per troughlevels and his renal function.discharge instructions/followup:  the patient was to followup in the liver clinic in two days from discharge.
