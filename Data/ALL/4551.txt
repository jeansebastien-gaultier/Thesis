5/12/2002history of present illness: the patient is a 78-year-old gentlemanwho is admitted for aortic valvereplacement on august , 2002. he has has asymptomatic aorticstenosis. he also has known coronary artery disease havingundergone angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronaryartery in 1991. catheterization at that time demonstrated an 80%left anterior descending lesion and a 60% first diagonal lesion.he has had a 4-5 year history of shortness of breath diagnosed withmild aortic stenosis and followed clinically. in the planningprocess for knee surgery , serial echocardiograms were performedshowing decreased aortic valve area and decreasing ejectionfraction. most recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severeaortic stenosis and has been suggested to have the valve replacedbefore undergoing knee surgery. the patient was admitted forelective aortic valve replacement prior to knee surgery. he has ahistory of class ii heart failure , slight limitation of physicalactivity. he is in normal sinus rhythm.past medical history: hypertension , insulin dependent diabetesmellitus , hypercholesterolemia , degenerativejoint disease of the bilateral knees , left greater than right ,status post left total knee replacement in 1994 with persistentsymptoms to undergo surgery for his knee , benign prostatichypertrophy , decreasing hearing , left greater than right.past surgical history: a total knee replacement in 1994 ,appendectomy in the 1960s.allergies: the patient has no known drug allergies.medications on admission: diltiazem er 180 mg once a day , isordil30 mg three times a day , enteric coatedaspirin 325 mg once a day , zocor 10 mg once a day , cozaar 25 mgonce a day , humulin n 30 units in the morning and 14 units in theevening.physical examination: vital signs: heart rate 80 and regular.heent: dentition is without evidence ofinfection. neck: no carotid bruits were heard. chest: clear.heart: regular rate and rhythm. he has a systolic ejection murmurat 3/6 in the aortic area radiating to the carotids. abdomen:soft and non-tender. extremities: left total knee replacementincision , no varicose veins. neurological: intact.laboratory: laboratory studies on admission include a bun of 13 ,creatinine 1.3 , white blood cell count 6.0 , hematocrit40.7. his echocardiogram performed on june , 2001 demonstratedan tpp hospital65% , aortic stenosis with a mean gradientof 42 mm hg , peak gradient of 63 mm hg , calculated valve area of0.9 cm squared with mild mitral insufficiency , trivialinsufficiency and a mildly dilated left atrium. ekg shows normalsinus rhythm at 88. chest x-ray is clear.hospital course: the patient underwent coronary arteriography onaugust , 2002 at wi wirolllen hospital .this examination showed a right dominant system with a diffuse 40%lesion of the left main , discrete 50% lesion of his proximal leftanterior descending coronary artery , a 70% lesion of his mid leftanterior descending artery with an 80% distal lesion. he also hadan 80% lesion of his first diagonal and a diffuse 50% proximallesion of the same vessel , 70% ostial lesion of his circumflex andan eccentric 45% lesion of his right coronary artery with a 70%lesion in his large left ventricular branch. the patient went tothe operating room on august , 2002 where he underwent an aorticvalve replacement with a #23 carpentier-edwards pericardial valveand a coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 with a left internalmammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery ,saphenous vein graft to the first marginal and saphenous vein graftto the posterior left ventricular branch. his intraoperativecourse was uneventful. he was seen in consultation by the diabeticmanagement service for blood sugar control and initiation into theportland protocol for intravenous insulin. his postoperativecourse was complicated by an episode of rapid atrial fibrillationwhich was treated with replacement of his electrolytes andinitiation of lopressor therapy and also mild anemia that wasmonitored and addressed with diuresis for fluid overload. hispostoperative course was uneventful. he continued to requirediuresis for pleural effusion. chest x-ray on dischargedemonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions. his hematocrit ondischarge is 25.6. at this point in time , there is no need totransfuse the patient. he is stable. heart rate is stable. he ison room air oxygenating at 97%. he is to be discharged torehabilitation on the following medications.medications on discharge: colace 100 mg three times a day ,albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. ,atrovent 0.5 mg q.i.d. , niferex 150 mg twice a day , lopressor 50 mgthree times a day , lasix 40 mg once a day , enteric coated aspirin325 mg once a day , simvastatin 20 mg at h.s. , potassium replacement20 meq once a day , czi scale , nph insulin 20 units in the morningand 10 units pre-dinner.follow up: the patient is to be discharged to the care
