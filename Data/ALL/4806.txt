type 2 dm on insulin,hypertension and dyslipidemia presents to the ed with two weekhistory of generalized weakness and poor po intake.  she reportshaving had nausea and vomiting for three days last week withsubsequent improvement over the week.  she had similar episodeof nausea/vomiting yesterday which led her daughters to bringher to the the [name (ni) ] today.  she reports no sick contacts,

depressed free wallcontractility. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildlythickened. there is no valvular aortic stenosis. the increasedtransaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.no

respiratorydistress during admission requiring intubation..active issues# junctional rhythm: the patient presented to the ed with hr inthe 50s and bp of 69/54. ekg showed junctional rhythm. she wasgiven glucagon 5 mg iv x 1 out of concern for beta-blockertoxicity. in the ccu, 1 mg atropine was administered with goodresponse and improvement in hr. she was started on anepinephrine gtt with improvement in hr, dripp was d/c'ed on[7-11]. echo [7-11] revealed mild symmetric left ventricularhypertrophy with hyperdynamic left ventricular function andright ventricular dilation and

bpso d/c'ed on [7-11]. am cortisol and tsh were normal. tte showedhyperdynamic lv function, dilated and depressed contractility ofthe rv. following bp normalization the pt became hypertensive(see

elevated right and left sided filling pressures withouthemodynamic evidence supporting constriction. ddx includedrestrictive process vs dchf and pulmonary htn. no evidence ofvalvular stenosis or angiographically-apparent cad was noted.thus, the pt was not placed on asa. pt to f/u with dr.
