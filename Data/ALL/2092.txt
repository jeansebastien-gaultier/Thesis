though initially concerned forsirs/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possiblesource of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasisulcers.  cxr, ua, blood cultures were all negative for signs ofinfection.  he did not have fever of systemic signs ofinfection.  initially he met systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome criteria with a possible source. he was started onvancomycin and unasyn empirically. on re-evaluation he remainedafebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis.his vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kepton per his vascular physicians prescription. hypotension waslikely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the settingof overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactivetachycardia.  metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held forhypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  hewas monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrialfibrillation with rvr.  however, he had asymptomatic sinustachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  this waslikely because his home medications were held, and histachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, anddiltiazem at his home doses.  torsemide was restarted on anevery other day dosing schedule.#. atrial fibrillation: chronic issue. on coumadin, metoprolol,diltizem, and digoxin at home. in the micu, he became mildlyhypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so hismetoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  upon trasnfer tofloor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcationsand metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia,particularly with exertion with pt. he should follow up with hispcp regarding titration of his rate control. his inr wassubtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. digoxinwas continued and level was not toxic.#. acute kidney injury: likely prerenal and related tohypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improvedwith holding torsemide and administration of ivf. his creatineand bun were trended and his creatine trended downward with ivfluids.#. stasis dermatitis with possible super imposed cellulitis:while in the micu he did not spike a fever or appear overtlyseptic by exam or review of systems. his leukocytosisnormalized. the decision was made to leave him on his outpatientdose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascularphysician.#. cirrhosis: this is a diagnosis that is currently undergoingoutpatient workup. he did not appear hypervolemic and this wasnot likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. hedenies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing aliver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. hisliver function was monitored while in the micu and remainedstable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis wasperformed.transitional issues:-vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up.-should f/u with pcp regarding torsemide dosing which wasdecreased to every other day.  he should be evaluated for lessaggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine.-he should follow up with his pcp and cardiology regardingtitration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.-warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his inr was 1.4medications on admission:preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.information was obtained from [month/year (2) 581].1. warfarin 2 mg po daily162. torsemide 50 mg po daily3. oxycodone (immediate release)  5 mg po bid:prn pain4. metoprolol succinate xl 50 mg po daily5. latanoprost 0.005% ophth. soln. 1 drop left eye hs6. diltiazem extended-release 180 mg po daily7. digoxin 0.125 mg po daily8. cephalexin 500 mg po q6hdischarge medications:1. cephalexin 500 mg po q6h2. digoxin 0.125 mg po daily3. latanoprost 0.005% ophth. soln. 1 drop both eyes hs4. oxycodone (immediate release)  5 mg po bid:prn pain5. oxycodone sr (oxycontin) 20 mg po q12h6. torsemide 20 mg po every other dayplease hold for sbp <100rx demadex 20 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth every other day disp #15tablet refills:07. warfarin 6 mg po daily168. metoprolol succinate xl 100 mg po dailyrx metoprolol succinate 100 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth daily disp#30 tablet refills:09. diltiazem extended-release 180 mg po daily10. outpatient lab workplease check inr [2173-8-9] and send results to [company 191] [hospital 3052]. phone [telephone/fax (1) 2173].discharge disposition:home with servicefacility:allcare vnadischarge diagnosis:primary: hyponatremia, acute kidney injurysecondary: atrial fibrillation, chronic systolic congestiveheart failuredischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory -
