can have repeat lipid profile as outpt andstatin at discretion of pcp. pt was continued on bb but dose wasdecreased to 50mg po daily as pt having asymptomatic bradycardia to 40'swhile sleeping.p: pt's os notes list chf as dx , pt denies any h/o le edema or chfbefore 2 weeks ago but is on lasix bid at home. last echo in 4/3showed lvh w/ preserved ef. pt with likely diastolic dysfunction. pt onexam has only le edema , but received 120 iv lasix in ed. pt'spresentation c/w chf exacerbation but bnp of 13 is unusual. continuedto diurese pt with iv lasix and once he was approaching euvolemiaswitched him back over to home dose. pt's le edema likely multifactorialdue to chf and some component of chronic venous stasis. lenis werechecked and were negative for dvts. discontinued pt's ccb as may becontributing to le edema. echo was repeated this admit whichshowed ef 60-65% and signs of diastolic dysfunction.htn: bp was controlled this admit. pt was continued on bb , norvasc , &catapresr: no issues this admitendo: pt has h/o dm and pt states he is taking insulin at home ( uncleardose ). pt was started on lantus with ss novolog and his sugars weresomewhat elevated. advised pt to restart home insulin regimen after d/c.sent hga1c but was still pending at the time of discharge.renal: pt appears to have ckd per shc recs -baseline 1.4-1.6 , renallydose medsneuro: pt's wife noted that pt has intermittently been confused at home.she describes episodes when he wakes up at night and doesn't know wherehe is. this is likely due to hypoxia as pt has severe sleep apnea andrarely wears cpap at home. pt was alert and oriented during this admit.sent labs to evaluate for secondary cause of dementia and they werenegative. suggested that pt f/u with pcp if these episodes persist.pulm: pt with h/o sleep apnea. per 2003 sleep study pt's sleep apneawas central and not obstructive although this is difficult to believebased on pt's body habitus and redundant neck tissue. pt evaluated bypulmonary after ra abg showed pao2 50's. pt pulse ox was monitored andwhen he fell asleep without his cpap he desatted to low 60's and high50's. pt satted in mid 90's on ra while awake and upright. pulmonarythought pt likely with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea( central +/- obstructive ). pt tried on empiric bipap ( 4/9 ) the nightprior to d/c and felt that he slept much better. of note pt used thenasal mask in house but has the full mask at home. tried to set up ptfor home bipap but is not eligible unless has another sleep study.communicated this with pt's pcp who will set up repeat sleep study innear future. pt also started on empiric qhs acetazolamide per pulmonaryrecs based on recent data showing that it improves symptoms in pt's withcentral sleep apnea and heart failure.ppx: lovenoxcode: fullfulladditional comments:discharge condition: stableto do/plan:no dictated summaryentered by: lague , richard f. , m.d.
