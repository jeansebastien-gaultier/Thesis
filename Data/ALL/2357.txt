:07/01/94principal diagnosis :cardiogenic shock .other diagnoses :1 ) coronary artery disease .2 ) atrial fibrillation .3 ) acute renal failure .4 ) crohn &apos;s disease .principal procedure :6/13/94 :intra-aortic balloon placement .6/17/94 :intubation .hemodialysis .history of present illness :this is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the fih for further care for cardiogenic shock .mr. given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .he had inferior myocardial infarction in february 1992 .his course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an lv ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .in august , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .he rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .he was transferred to the fih where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .an automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .he was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the lad and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , mr. given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .mr. given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .he was admitted to the hospital in late april with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .colonoscopy demonstrated severe crohn &apos;s disease with sparing of the rectum .a perirectal fistula was seen .treatment with iv corticosteroids led to improvement and mr. given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .on the evening of april 22nd , mr. given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .he presented to the iming medical center emergency room on the morning of april 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .he was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .he is now being transferred to the fih for further treatment .physical examination :physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .his cvp was 16 .he was on the balloon pump at the time .his chest was clear anteriorly .his cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .no murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .his abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .his feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .laboratory data :admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .the sodium was 126 , the bun 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .there were inferior q waves consistent with an old infarct .the chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .hospital course :mr. given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .he was maintained on levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .it was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , mr. given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .after replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , mr. given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .he did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .it was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .he also remained intubated .mr. given was seen by dr. farstshuff of the gi service for advice regarding his crohn &apos;s disease .all of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .as mr. given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .he was seen in consultation by dr. needs of the renal unit .dr. needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .procainamide was begun in an effort to convert mr. given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .as mr. given &apos;s renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .this resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .he was able to get some fluid off as well .with getting some volume off , the patient &apos;s ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .his cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .on 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .with a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .the balloon pump was restored .he was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .he continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .supportive care continued .unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .mr. given &apos;s blood pressure appeared to stabilize .another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .he had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .he did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .his hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .he continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .this resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .he did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .on 6/29 mr. given began developing periods of hypotension .the patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .he began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .the patient and his significant friend , incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .indicative of this , mr. given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .he developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .caghala r. pain , m.d.tr :xhdd :01/01/96td
