no other recent animal contact. no recent falls. his pfts demonstrated a worsening fev1 and ct scan demonstrates evidence of worsening obstruction, likely related to rejection. he is being admitted for treatment of acute on chronic rejection.ros:   negative in detail except as noted above. pmh/old data1.bronchiectasis. status post bilateral lung transplantation 8/02/2073. acute and chronic rejection. admitted with bronchietasis flare with serratia in 5/79, tx with cefepime and pip/tazo.2.history of psa, serratian in sputum.on colisitin nebs3.osa. on cpap 14 cm h20 with 4l humidified oxygen4.osteoporosis5.avn right hip and knee6.obesity7.hcv8.htn9.depression10.    psoriasis11.    cri12.    gastroparesis13.    cataracts14.    hyperlipidemiapsh1.bilat lung transplant 7/73allergies/adverse reactions: nkdaoutpatient meds on admit: 1.acyclovir 200 mg po tid2.albuterol mdi 90mcg q4-6h prn3.albuterol neb q4h prn4.azithromycin 250 mg qmwf5.bactrim ss qmwf6.calcium citrate 600 mg bid7.cellcept 500 mg bid8.colistin neb 150 mg daily9.cozaar 100 mg daily10.    doxycycline 100 mg bid11.    flonase nasal spray bid12.    lasix 40 mg daily13.    lipitor 40 mg daily14.    magnesium gluconate 1000 mg tid15.    mvidaily16.    nexium 20 mg daily17.    norvasc 5 mg daily18.    pamidronate60 mg q6 months19.    kcl 20meq bid20.    prednisone 10 mg daily21.    tacrolimus 5 mg po bid22.    reglan 5 mg ac and at bedtime23.    toprol xl 50 mg daily24.    vitamin d50,000 units weeklysoc hx: married to another transplant patient. no children. lives in florida. works as a electric appliance repairer. lifelong non-smoker. no etoh or illicits.fam hx:   no bronchiectasis, no h/o cadphysical examvs:       t 96.3, bp 124/74, hr 85, rr 25, o2 sat 94 2l nc at rest;
