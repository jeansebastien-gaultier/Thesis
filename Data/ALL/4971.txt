record date: 2097-06-10	cardiology		willow garden care center			note: there is an addendum for this note (6/10/2097)			reason for visit:   mr. bell is an 81 year old male with recent cabg, now admitted via ew with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia for further evaluation.	interval history:   he has multiple cardiac risk factors and a history of cad dating back to april 2097. at that point, he noted increasing chest pressure and dyspnea on minimal exertion. following a positive stress test, he was admitted for cardiac catheterization. coronary angiography revealed severe multi vessel cad. he had an iabp placed and underwent cardiac surgical evaluation. carotid non-invasive studies revealed a moderate right carotid lesion with mild left carotid disease. he underwent a 4 vessel cabg by dr. troyer. his graft anatomy includes a lima to the lad, svg to the pda and plv and a svg to the om branch. he required re-exploration for bleeding. he also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, treated with amiodarone. his iabp was removed a few days post operatively. he developed new anterior st changes, and an echocardiogram revealed a marked decline in his lv function from 66% to 19%. he was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab. coronary angiography revealed a widely patent svg to om, a 30% ostial lesion in the svg to the pda and plv. the lima was patent, but there was no flow into the distal lad. he underwent stenting of the lima anastomosis into the lad with a 2.5mm x 18mm, 2.5mm x 12mm and 2.5mm x 12mm minivision stents. his post cardiac surgical course was further complicated by a serratia pneumonia and a transient worsening renal function. he also required sternal rewiring for sternal instability. he was followed by dr. hardin. his hit assay was borderline negative. he was also found to have a factor vii deficiency, and was treated with argatroban. lower extremity non-invasive studies revealed a r posterior tibial dvt, and he was discharged on fopndaparinux. a follow up echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 31% with apical akinesis, with only mild mitral regurgitation. he was discharged to rehab on post operative day 20. he was discharged from rehab on june 5th. on june 7th he was lightheaded and found to be hypotensive by the vna. his systolic pressures were 78 to 90 mmhg, and his lisinopril was decreased and his lasix dose was cut in half. he denies any chest discomfort, throat or arm discomfort or palpitations. he denies any pnd, but has been sleeping in a hospital bed with the head elevated 45 degrees. the family updated the office earlier this morning - 2 pound weight gain and shortness of breath. his lasix was increased to 40 mg bid. however, when seen by vna, his room air saturation was 76%. 911 was called and he was brought to wgcc ed for evaluation. 	past medical history:   cm/cad as described, hypertension, type ii dm x 15 yrs- with nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy, mild renal insufficiency, pvd, carotid disease, factor vii deficiency, bph, hearing loss, vitamin b12 deficiency. psh: cabg 5/01/97, cataract od.		changes to allergies	nka: no known allergies - reaction: [reviewed]	medications (confirmed):	aspirin  81mg po daily - took 4 this amatenolol  25mg po bidfondaparinux  5mg sc dailyglyburide  5mg po dailylasix  40mg po bidmagnesium oxide  800 mg po tidmultivitamins  1 tab po dailyomeprazole  20mg po dailyplavix  75mg po dailypotassium chloride  10meq po dailyregular insulin  sliding scale sc tidsimvastatin  80mg po qpmtrazodone  50mg x 1/2 tab po at bedtimevitamin b12  1000 mcg po daily	family history:   f deceased with cardiomyopathy at 64;
