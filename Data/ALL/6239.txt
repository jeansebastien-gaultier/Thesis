[location (un) 2174] ataxia and cardiomyopathywith ejection fraction of 35 percent and diastolicdysfunction with negative catheterization, atrialfibrillation on coumadin, and insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus, who was in her usual state of health until 2-3weeks prior to admission she had episodes of nausea andvomiting.  the patient also noted paroxysmal nocturnaldyspnea and orthopnea with a 30-pound weight gain anddecreased urine output.  she was noted to have an inr of 19.5on admission.  she was given vitamin k and admitted to thefennard intensive care unit for concern for gastrointestinalbleed.  the patient was also found to have nephrotic rangeproteinuria and elevated lfts.  echocardiogram revealeddepression in her ejection fraction to 20 percent.  giservice was consulted and it suspected that her increasingliver function tests were secondary to ischemic liver injurywith paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension.  therenal service was consulted and felt her creatinine increaseand proteinuria may be secondary to underlying diabeticnephropathy with severe right-sided heart failure.  she wasinitially started on lasix for her uncompensated congestiveheart failure, but her creatinine rose, so she wastransferred to the [hospital ward name 517] to initiate nesiritidetreatment.physical examination:  temperature 98.6, heart rate 66-78,blood pressure 125-130/82-91, respirations 20, she issaturating 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  generally,in mild respiratory distress, alert and oriented x 3.  heent:mucous membranes moist.  obese

withnon-ischemic congestive heart failure associated with[location (un) 2174] ataxia with a recent worsening of her ejectionfraction to 20 percent.  the patient had mild elevation inher cardiac enzymes, more consistent with atrial fibrillationand hypotension in the [hospital unit name 153].  these enzymes trended down andwere not consistent with myocardial infarction.  the patientwas felt to be at risk for arrhythmia secondary to her severecongestive heart failure and would likely need pacemakerreplacement in the future.  she was started on a natrecordrip due to her worsening renal function with lasix.  she wasdiuresed well with the natrecor and the congestive heartfailure service followed her while she was in the hospital.after several days of natrecor diuresis, she was transitionedto lasix, although her creatinine rose to 2.1 and thereforeher lasix was held for 1 day and her lasix dose wasdecreased.atrial flutter:  the patient has evidence of sick sinussyndrome with occasional positives and is very sensitive tobeta-blockers.  she was started on dofetilide per theelectrophysiology service in an attempt to convert her tosinus rhythm to improve her congestive heart failure.  thepatient did convert to sinus rhythm on dofetilide, althoughher creatinine was unstable and rose to 2.1.  therefore,dofetilide was considered to be a poor antiarrhythmic choicefor her.  per the electrophysiology service, there were noother antiarrhythmic options and the patient will need tofollow up for a flutter ablation and if the flutter ablationis unsuccessful, likely av node ablation with pacemakerplacement.renal:  the patient was in nephrotic range proteinuria,likely due to diabetic nephropathy.  the patient's creatinineduring her hospitalization rose to 2.1 and her lasix dose wassubsequently decreased.  because of her unstable creatininedofetilide was felt to be a poor antiarrhythmic for her.elevated lfts:  there was no clear toxic etiology forincreased lfts.  her hepatitis a virus igg was positive,although all other hepatitis serologies were negative.acetaminophen level was negative.  this was felt to be eitherrelated to transient hypotension in the [hospital unit name 153] versus hepaticcongestion from congestive heart failure.  during herhospitalization, her lfts improved.urinary tract infection:  the patient with a positive ua, wastreated with levofloxacin.insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus:  the patient wasfollowed by the [last name (un) ] service while an inpatient and startedon lantus which was titrated up, and sliding scale

ideations.[location (un) 2174] ataxia:  the patient was followed by dr.[name (ni) 22985]team, the neurogeneticist, and initiated on coenzyme-qtreatment while in hospital.  she will continue on this as
