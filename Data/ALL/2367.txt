distress.  his heent examination was normalexcept for dry mucous membranes.  his neck was supple with 7cm of jugular venous pressure.  his chest was clear toauscultation bilaterally.  he had a regular rate and rhythmwith a systolic murmur.  his abdomen was soft andnondistended with mild epigastric tenderness and normalactive bowel sounds.  the patient had black stools that wereguaiac positive.  his extremities showed no pedal edema.pulses were +2 bilaterally.  neurological examination wasgrossly intact.  the patient was alert and oriented x 3.nasogastric lavage was deferred as egd was to be done.laboratory data:  hematocrit was 24.3.  the remainder of thepatient's complete blood count, chem-10 and basic coagulationstudies were within normal limits.ekg:  on admission the patient was in normal sinus rhythmwith a rate of 76, normal axis and intervals and no ischemicchanges.chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or interstitial edema.hospital course:  1. upper gi bleed:  egd performed on[2168-4-18] revealed a normal egd to the second part of theduodenum.  in the second part of the duodenum a fresh clotlocated between the duodenal bulb and the ampulla was noted.after washings there was fresh bleeding that completelyobscured visualization.  despite multiple attempts ofwashings, therapeutic cautery was impossible with egd.  giventhe brisk bleeding, an emergent artery embolization wasneeded.  interventional radiology performed an embolizationof the gastroduodenal artery and noted a pseudoaneurysm atthe entrance into the duodenum.  this was performed on[2168-4-18].  the patient's hematocrit reached a nadir of 13.9on [2168-4-18] and required six units of packed red blood cellsfor resuscitation.  following the embolization describedabove the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocritremained stable at approximately 28.  the patient's diet wasadvanced slowly 48 hours following the procedure withoutcomplications.  serial examinations were performed toevaluate for ischemic colitis which revealed a completelybenign abdomen.gastroenterology followed the patient during the course ofadmission and made several recommendations to decrease futurerisks of gi bleeding, including protonix b.i.d. for at leasttwo weeks and then continued q.d. thereafter, avoidance ofnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and omega oils,avoidance of alcohol and avoidance of coffee.prior to discharge, a repeat endoscopy was done to reevaluatethe region of active bleeding.  this was performed on[2168-4-21] and revealed a shallow ulcer in the second part ofthe duodenum.  per gastroenterology, this region is stableand the patient does not require further follow up from theirdepartment unless there are signs of recurrent bleeding, suchas presyncope, bloody stools, melena, or hemodynamicallyinstability.  helicobacter pylori was negative.2. chest pain:  the patient had the band-like chest pain onpresentation that was typical of his chronic pain.  thepatient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  he had anormal ekg.  pain resolved with treatment of upper gi bleedand with ultram.3. back pain:  the patient was initiated on a treatment planwith ultram as an alternative to ibuprofen for chronic backpain.  the patient states that he gained adequate relief withthis regimen and did not find any significant side effects inthe first few days to use.  he will be discharged with aprescription for ultram.  tylenol may also be used.discharge diagnoses:1. upper gi bleed.2. anemia secondary to blood loss status post six units ofpacked red blood cells.3.
