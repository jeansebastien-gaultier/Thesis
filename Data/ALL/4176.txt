vascularity involving the anterior abdominal wall, extending in to the scrotum without evidence of drainable fluid collection or air pockets. mild induration and thickening of the overlying skin of the abdominal wall is also noted. stable postsurgical scar in the right anterior abdominal wall. surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. there is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. there are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.procedure note: the area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. a 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. a culture of the abscess fluid was sent. the wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. the wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. a dry sterile dressing was applied. the patient tolerated the procedure well. impression/plan: 33 year old diabetic male with
