ct through the chest was acquiredwithout ivcontrast. 5-, 1.25-mm collimation images, sagittal and coronalreformations were provided and reviewed.findings: the airways are patent to the segmental level. thereis increase in number and size of mediastinal lymph nodeslocated in all stations. they measure up to 8 mm in theprevascular station, 10 mm in the upper pretracheal station, inthe left lower paratracheal station measuring 10 mm, precarinalstation up to 12 mm. evaluation of hilar lymph nodes is limiteddue to the lack of iv contrast. some of the lymph nodes arecalcified in the left hilum and the left paraesophageal station.there is mild cardiomegaly. there is no pericardial effusion.mild-to-moderate calcifications are in the lad and circumflexcoronary arteries. cardiac size is normal.large right and moderate left pleural effusions are layering andnonhemorrhagic, associated with adjacent areas of atelectasis. anoncalcified lung nodule in the right lower lobe measures 5 mm(4, 105). large multiple areas of ground glass opacityassociated with smooth interlobular septal thickening arepresent in the upper lobes bilaterally, right greater than left.the upper abdomen is unremarkable. there are no bone findings ofmalignancyimpression: improved pulmonary edema. bilateral pleuraleffusions.5-mm right lower lobe lung nodule. followup in one year isrecommended.cardiomegaly.brief hospital course:1) acute renal failure: developed after transfer from osh,likely atn secondary to contrast load on [2183-8-30] + sirs +hypotension in the icu overnight the evening of [2183-8-31]. fena5%, lytes remained stable. patient was given continuous ivfluids and developed post-atn diuresis complicated by oneepisode of hypernatremia. her creatinine slowly improved and was1.5 at the time of discharge..2) ?multifocal pneumonia: could very well have represented ards,but given fevers, persistent oxygen requirement and concerningct at osh patient was treated with vanc/zosyn. blood cultureswere sent at the osh and remained negative. patient was weanedoff of oxygen and remained stable on room air..3) pancreatitis: lipase significantly decreased by the time oftransfer; patient was never nauseous or with abdominal pain.ercp was not felt to be indicated and she was followedclinically as her diet was advanced. a repeat mrcp performed on[2183-9-11] was normal..4) intermittent fevers: patient had continued low-grade feversthroughout her hospital stay. cxr, ua, blood cultures, and mrcpwere unrevealing. infectious disease was consulted andsuggested that a drug reaction to penicillin be considered aspart of the differential diagnosis, but also recommended hep c,hep b, rpr, and hiv as initial work up. these were obtained andreturned negative prior to the patient's discharge except forthe hepatitis c serologies which are still pending. as theworkup was in progress, the patient's fever curve decreased andshe subsequently became afebrile 3 days prior to her discharge.because the patient deffervesced, the infectious disease servicedid not feel that an echocardiogram, blood smears for parasites,or other serologies needed to be pursued as an inpatient. theservice made two other recommendations:a) a shorter follow up interval for her small lung nodule than12 months due to her history of fever.b) that after her acute illness subsided to consider checkingcrp, esr and nuclear medicine studies if all else was negative;and to also consider checking anaplasma/ehrlichia serologies,anca, [doctor first name ], spep/upep and consider rheumatological evaluation +/-oncology evaluation..5) maculo papular rash: the patient developed a rash across herabdomen, back and all 4 extremities 4 days prior to herdischarge. the rash was thought to be part of a possible drugreaction to penicillins although the timing was after she haddiscontinued her zosyn. it was treated with benedryl and sarnaand almost completely resolved by the time of discharge..6) increased mediastinal lymphadenpathy and 5mm lung nodule onct as noted above -  requires follow-up in [4-30] months.medications on admission:prilosec 20 mg dailysynthroid 75 mcg

hospital forevaluation of pancreatitis and pneumonia. your pancreatitisimproved without further intervention. your pneumonia wastreated with broad spectrum antibiotics. your hospital coursewas complicated by acute renal failure, which improved with ivfluids. you had low-grade fevers until the end of your hospitalstay without a clear cause. you were  seen in consultation byour infectious disease specialists who recommended several bloodtests for look for a possible infection that may be causing yourfevers. all of these tests were negative, including hepatitis b,hiv, and an rpr test. you have a pending test for hepatitis cthat you can check at your follow up appointment. the infectiousdisease doctors recommended that [name5 (ptitle) ] get an echocardiogram ofyour heart, but your fevers have gone away before this testcould be scheduled in the hospital. you should follow up withyour primary physician to consider whether an echocardiogramshould be done as an outpatient. a small lung nodule was seen onyour ct scan of your lungs that will need to be followed up withyour primary physician.there have been no changes to your home medications.followup instructions:please follow-up with your primary care doctor within one weekof discharge.department: [hospital3 249]when: friday [2183-9-19] at 9:30 amwith: [company 191] post [hospital 894] clinic [telephone/fax (1) 250]building:
