[known lastname 28331] is a 46 year old woman with history of aml s/pallogeneic stemcell transplant from an unrelated donor in [2124-10-24], withtbi and cytoxan for conditioning regimen.  her course wascomplicated by graft versus host disease of the skin and lungs,hypertension and numerous steroid-related complications such asdiabetes, steroid myopathy, and increased peripheral edema..she presents today from clinic with right arm swelling (she hada picc in the arm) and was found to have a completely occludedright basilic vein.  she has some pain in the right arm,especially with movement.  the picc line was pulled and she wasadmitted for anticoagulation..of note, she was recently discharged after she was admitted withenterococcal bacteremia (vanco sensitive); she finished hercourse of ampicillin yesterday.  she has otherwise been doingwell at rehab-- she has been slowly diuresed and is making someprogress with pt.past medical history:pmh/psh:1) acute myelogenous

appeared to be total body overloaded byintravascularly dry at admission. she [month/day/year 1834] right heartcatheterization on [2126-12-6] that showed pulmonary hypertension(systolic bp 45, diastolic bp 20, mean bp 28). she was thereforestarted on sildenafil. the nephrology service was consulted, andshe diuresed well on a regimen on albumin, lasix, andchlorthiazide (then metolazone). her diuresis was discontinuedon [1-8] because of development of hypotension occuring in thesetting of a urinary tract infection. subsequently, she wastransferred to the [hospital unit name 153] for hypotension (see below) wheresildenafil was d/c'd as the patient was unlikely benefiting fromit in the setting of relatively mild to moderate pulmonary htnand overall systemic hypotension.2. uti: she developed a urinary tract infection with pseudomonason [12-15] and was treated with a two week course of levofloxacinthen ciprofloxacin. a repeat urine culture was obtained forfollowup on [1-2] although she was afebrile and had no urinarycomplaints. this culture again grew out pseudomonas, this timequinolone resistant. her foley catheter was changed, as sherefused to have it removed. she subsequently developed a feverto 101.3 on [1-7] and was started on cefepime, with addition ofvancomycin and flagyl on [1-8]. upon transfer to the [hospital unit name 153] forhypotension and tachycardia (see below), she was continued onvancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. a central venous line andarterial line were placed under sterile conditions. after 24hours in the icu, the patient was on 3 pressors with thedifferential diagnosis including septic vs. cardiogenic shock.meropenem was added as for double gram-negative and psuedomonascoverage. in spite of maximal medical therapy, the patientremained maxed out on 3 pressors. a repeat family meeting washeld with the pt's hcp and mother, who agreed to make thepatient cmo. she expired shortly thereafter. an autospy wasoffered, but declined.3. hypotension and tachycardia: she developed hypotension to the70's sytolic on [1-8] which responded initially to fluid boluses.her hypotension was thought to reflect both aggressive diuresisand possible urosepsis. she developed tachycardia to the 120'son [1-9] with a new rbbb. she was transferred to the [hospital unit name 153] whereshe was given adenosine 6 mg x 2 with conversion to sinustachycaria after the second dose of adenosine. however, she wentback into a wide complex tachycardia with a rbbb pattern soonthereafter. the cardiology team evaluated her and felt that thisrhythm was most likely an svt with rate related aberancy;however the following day, after reviewing the ekg strips withthe ep attending, the patient was determined to have a fasicularventricular tachycardia in the setting of no known prior cad orischemic scar. the treatment of choice in this setting wouldhave been verapimil; however this was not feasible as thepatient was already on 3 pressors (neo, levophed, andvasopressin). the following day, a dose of verapimil was triedgiven concern for possibly worsening cardiogenic shock (howeverthe patient's extremities remained warm to palpation, whichsuggested likely septic shock) with conversion back to sinustachycardia. she was not cardioverted secondary to the patient'swishes to remain dnr/dni. given the patient's lack ofimprovement in spite of maximal medical care, the patient wasmade cmo after another family meeting and expired shortlythereafter.3. c. diff colitis: she experienced loose stools after admissionand a stool sample was positive for c. diff toxin on [12-8]; shewas subsequently treated with a 14 day course of flagyl. thiswas restarted on [1-8] as noted above in the context of recurrentfever and increased stooling.4. right basilic vein thrombosis: the patient's picc line wasremoved and she was started on iv heparin and then coumadin. heranticoagulation was discontinued in the setting of heme positivestools and widely varying inr (thought likely to be due tointeractions with her many medications). a repeat ultrasound ofthe upper extremity showed no evidence of persistent thrombustherefore she was not continued on further anticoagulation.5. aml with history of gvhd: she was continued on cyclosporine,cellcept, and her prednisone was titrated down per bmtrecommendations.6. elevated lfts: her transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, andbilirubin were moderately elevated and thought to be secondaryto gvhd of the liver after review of her medication list andright upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no other clear causesof these findings. her alkaline phosphatase elevation wasprobably due at least in part to her bony disease as the bonespecific fraction was elevated as well.7. acute renal failure: the patient's creatinine was 1.3 atadmission peaking at 1.9. she was thought to be intravascularlydry with prerenal failure. her creatinine improved with additionof albumin to her diuretic regimen consistent with this.8. pulmonary hypertension: ms. [known lastname 28331] [last name (titles) 1834] right heartcatheterization on [12-7] to assess whether pulmonaryhypertension might be contributing to her significant edema.this study showed mean pulmonary pressures of 28 and she wassubsequently started on sildenafil, which was subsequently d/c'dupon transfer to the [hospital unit name 153] (see above).9. heme positive stools: as noted above, she had heme positivestools in the setting of anticoagulation with iv heparin andwarfarin and recent c. difficile colitis infectoin. in addition,she had a prior history of gastritis on endoscopy and wasreceiving steroids for her gvhd. she was started on a ppi andher hct was followed closely.10. hyperparathyroidism and vitamin d deficiency: the patient'spth was rechecked as the differential for her bone changes notedon plain films included osteitis fibrosa. she was evaluated bythe endocrinology consult service who felt that herhyperparathyroidism was likely secondary, perhaps due to renalfailure or steroid use. her vitamin d levels were rechecked andfound to be low. she was started on weekly vitamin d and dailycalcium. she will need repeat vitamin d studies and shouldfollow up with endocrinology for further management. she wasstarted on a bisphosphonate per endocrine recs.11. pulmonary osteoarthropathy: she complained of diffuse bodypains and aches. imaging of her extremities was notable fordiffuse periosteal reaction. the endocrinology service reviewedthe films and felt the history and imaging were most consistentwith pulmonary osteoarthropathy. her pain was treated with oraldilaudid as needed for pain control.12. eye pains: ms. [known lastname 28331] complained of eye soreness. this wasthought to be secondary to gvhd. she was started on cyclosporineye drops and artificial tears. she was evaluated by theopthalmology consult service who recommended addition of refresheye drops which she continued with relief of her symptoms.medications on admission:atenolol 100 mg qdcell cept [pager number ] mg qamcellcept [pager number ] mg qpmhydralazine 25 mg q 6 hrsneoral 50 mg qamneoral 25 mg qhsprednisone 15 mg [hospital1 ]valtrex 500 mg [hospital1 ]vfend 200 mg [hospital1 ]benzonatateazithromycin 250 mg qodbactrim ds mwflantus 12 u qdhssizolpidem 10 mg qdoxycodone 5 mg prnodansetron 4 mg q 8 hrs prnalbuterol prndischarge medications:n/adischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:cardiorespiratory arrestseptic vs. cardiogenic shockpsuedomonas utifasciular ventricular tachycardiaaml c/b gvhdr basilic dvtacute renal failureanasarcapulmonary hypertensiondischarge condition:expireddischarge instructions:n/afollowup instructions:n/acompleted by:[2127-1-13]
