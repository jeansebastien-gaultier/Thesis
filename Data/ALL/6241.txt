interval, there has been little change in theoverall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantlyhyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axialspace of the left parietovertex. this appears to "mold" to thecontour of the subjacent convexity, where there is focallow-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter,corresponding to the flair-signal abnormality in this region,which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion,gliosis, or both. the overall appearance is most suggestive of apartially calcified en plaque meningioma, though there is nospecific evidence of "reactive change" in the suprajacent innertable of the skull. there has been no other short-intervalchange.impression: no short-interval change in the overall appearance,with thelobulated, predominantly hyperdense, process, in the extra-axialspace at the left parietovertex, given its stability and mr[date range ] more likely an en plaque meningioma, partiallycalcified, accounting for the mr [first name (titles) 16313] [last name (titles) ].moreover, the findings on both this exam and the recent enhancedmr studyraise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion ofthe immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus, withoutdefinite thrombosis, and possible venous obstruction-relatededema in local white matter. if this will affect therapeuticdecision, dedicated mr [first name (titles) ] [last name (titles) ] venography might be considered.mri brain [2200-2-15]:findings:the study is significantly limited due to patient motionartifacts. there is enhancement noted in the area of knownhemorrhage in the left parieto-occipital region, compared to the pre-contrast sequences done onthe priorstudy. however, the etiology of enhancement is not clear asthere issignificant amount of hemorrhage in this location, as seen onthe prior ct and mr studies. mildly dilated ventricles arevisualized, not adequately assessed.impression:1. study significantly limited due to motion artifacts.enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region, partlyextending along the dura, theetiology of which is uncertain, as this is in the region of theknownhemorrhage. repeat evaluation, after resolution of thehemorrhage can beconsidered, to evaluate for any underlying vascular orspace-occupying lesion. close followup with ct scan can also beconsidered as clinically indicated.brief hospital course:the patient was admitted on [2200-2-14] to the neurosurgery serviceafter a mental status change at the nursing home. he wasadmitted with a presumed sdh on the ct scan. however, thepatient had an mri which revealed a mass resembling ameningioma. there was no hemorrhage there. the patient wastransferred out of the icu on [2200-2-18].he was evaluated by pt and a speech/swallowing therapist. ptfelt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing homeon [2200-2-19]. on [2-19] he was also able to take in thin liquids andpureed solids without difficulty.he had his foley catheter removed on [2-18] but had urinaryretention. a coud?????? catheter was placed that night and he wasdischarged with it in place. flomax was started as well andbladder training was begun. he may be able to have it removed ina day or so at the nursing home. the patient should follow upwith a urologist.the patient was made dnr/dni in the hospital by his health careproxy as well as for the ambulance ride. palliative care andmedical consults were obtained to assist in management of thepatient. his medications were optimized due to his mental statuschanges. additionally a family meeting with all 3 teamsoccurred. it was felt that surgery would not benefit the patientand that quality of life was important. we all agreed that beingat the nursing home with his wife would be the best for him atthis time. the nursing home staff may want to consider a "do nothospitalize" policy with this patient and his health care proxy.medications on admission:lisinopril 10 mg po
