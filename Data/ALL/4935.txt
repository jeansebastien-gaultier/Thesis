pt admitted w/ primarily hypoxic respiratory failure .following admission to the floor the pt developed increasing hypoxia and somnolence , requiring intubation on hd 5 .pulm had previously been consulted and felt that presentation was c/w pcp , joann started on bactrim .previously treated for cap as outpt but hypoxia continued to progress .similar lack of improvement w/ additional broad spectrum coverage following admission .pt underwent bronchoscopy on 11-22 following transfer to the icu for hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation ( 7.25/52/70 on 100% nrb ) .on admission to the icu the pt ' steroid dose was increased to 8 mg bid 03-07 to a dead space measurement of 50% .pt did well in the icu , w/ his respiratory status steadily improving and was extubated on01-03 .he was subsequently tranferred to the floor , where he continued to have a stable oxygen requirement .repeat cxr was unchanged from previously in the icu ( official read noted mild chf , but pt was continuing to autodiurese and has remained net negative everyday while on the floor .on discharge the patient has stable o2 req , 90% on ra .2) astrocytoma - grade ii , as per d/w pmd , dr. holscher , pt has poor prognosis , but reasonable for ongoing treatment .pt has had two recent neg head ct s , so unlikely the etiology of the patient 's ms change .pt was continued on keppra during admission for sz px .initially he had been on lamotrigine but the was stopped in 10/12 when the pt was noted to be developing a new rash .decadron has been steadily tapered since arrival on the floor .now continued on 1 mg bid , to complete a 7 day course , which will be tapered to 1 mg qday on 01-15 , and subsequently to 0.5 mg qday x 7 days then to be discontinued .the patient 's keppra should be continued for sz prophylaxis .3) ms change - on admission pt was agitated , requiring restraints and antipsychotics , however as he became increasingly hypoxic he became somnolent .in the icu the pt remained stuporous , responsive to painful stimuli .on the floor the patient intially was imporved , but has plateaued , responding to simple commands and verbalizing groans but no real speech .improvement has correlated w/ tapering of steroids , one of the causes in the differential .pt had multiple head ct s which ruled out progression of astrocytoma .mri has been deferred given that the pt currently would not tolerate the procedure .eeg was w/o evidence of epileptiform activity and c/w toxic encephalopathy .plan to continue to follow ms , expect improvement as steroids are continued to be tapered .4) h/o dvt - cont heparin , previously on enoxaparin x10 days at treatment dose , followed by prophylactic dose .on admission , the pt was started on treatment doses of enoxaparin .upon transfer to the intensive care unit the pt was started on heparin gtt .course was c/b one episode of gross hematochezia on 12-28 , w/ concomitant hct drop of ~ 3 pts .b/l lower ext duplex us and a cta were performed , both of which were negative .given that the pt was w/o evidence of dvt it was felt that the risks of anticoagulation in the setting of gross gib , outweigh the risks of undetected deep vv thrombosis/pe .pt was continued on prophylactic heparin .4) hypersensitivity reaction - on 11-24 pt was noted to have developing rash of abdomen and anterior thighs .derm initially reviewed and thought that it was not c/w hypersensitivity rxn .over the next the rash progressed , and the patient subsequently began spiking fevers to approx 103 f , c/b hypotension requiring aggressive fluid repletion and pressors , and tachycardia to the130s .the patient also developed elevated transaminases and pancreatic enzymes during this time .on the second day that the rash had been noted , derm was asked to see again , felt c/w hypersensitivity , bactrim was switched to pentamidine , and lamictal was held .pt continued to have elev pancreatic enzymes and pentamidine was switched to clinda/primaquine .following discontinuation of the bactrim the patient defervesced , and remained normotensive .he received one dose of furosemide in the icu and was transferred to the floor the next day .on arrival to the floor the patient was noted to have a lacy reticular rash of upper arms , which resolved over the next 48h .felt likely 03-07 the sulfa moiety of the furosemide .plan for pt to complete total of 28 day course of therapy for pcp , james will be completed on 01-16 .5) anemia - previous w/u c/w acd ( elev ferritin , low transferrin saturation ) .- transfuse threshold < 246) arf - cr mildly elevated on tx to icu , u lytes c/w prerenal azotemia , which resolved w/ ivf .7) hyponatremia - also hyponatremic on transfer , resolved w/ ivf .8) cad - w/ abnl ef , however pt tolerated aggressive fluid resusciation w/o significant hypoxia .continued on valsartan , bb continued , statin9) nutrition -
