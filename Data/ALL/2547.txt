therefore , the planwas to discharge her. on the floor the patient received two gramsof ceftazidime x one and then was taken off of antibiotics.on the afternoon of 9 of june the patient's oxygen saturationsuddenly dropped. she complained of feeling short of breath andnauseous. her room air saturation was 82% when these symptomsfirst developed. over the next 30 minutes the patientdecompensated and her oxygenation was steadily increased; however ,on 100% nonrebreather face mask her oxygen saturation was less than80% and her skin appeared mottled. a portable chest x-ray showedmild congestive heart failure. the patient's ekg showed a normalsinus rhythm , no axis changes and no st changes. the patient hadreceived 100 mg of iv compazine for nausea; otherwise , no newmedications since admission. her temperature was 100.5 at 2:00p.m. because of her rapid decompensation a code green was calledand she was intubated and transferred to the micu. abg showed a phof 7.35 , a pco2 of 44 , and a po2 of 96 following intubation. bloodpressure remained , during this time , at 130 to 200 over 70 to 90with heartrates in the 70's to 90's. during her rapiddecompensation the patient was given nebulizers , but with noeffect. the cause of the patient's sudden decompensation wasunclear. during the period of rapid decompensation the patient gota total of 100 mg of iv lasix. her lung exam showed some crackles ,but she did not appear to be all that wet. a chest x-ray threehours post intubation showed diffuse fluffy infiltrates in thebilateral lung fields , more central than peripheral. no effusionwas noted. based on the findings of this chest x-ray , a vq scanwas not done. it was thought that the rapid decompensation was dueto either pulmonary edema ( the patient had been on 150 cc an hourof iv fluids for approximately 24 hours because she was dehydratedwhen she first came in ) , blood , or pneumonia. the patient wascovered with vancomycin , ceftazidime ( for pseudomonas ) ,levofloxacin ( for legionella ) , and pentamidine ( for pcp ). thepatient was also given 50 mg of iv solu-medrol b.i.d. numerouslaboratory studies were sent off including: rsv , influenza ,parainfluenza , vre , legionella , pcp , adenovirus , acid-fast bacilli ,ch50 , and ana , all of which were negative. urine and bloodcultures were negative as well. cardiogenic pulmonary edema wasthought to be an unlikely cause , given that she had a normal leftventricular size and an ejection fraction of 50% in anechocardiogram done right after being intubated. there was also noevidence of any right ventricular dysfunction or rv strain.she did well over the two days following intubation and wasextubated on 13 of march a bronchoscopy was considered , given thepatient's history of hemoptysis , but as the hemoptysis resolvedover the next couple of days , it was thought to be unnecessary.the patient's oxygen saturation following extubation was 95% onthree liters nasal cannula and continued to be in the mid 90's onceshe was weaned to room air in the subsequent two days. allantibiotics were stopped while the patient was in the micu exceptfor levofloxacin , which was continued for a seven to ten daycourse. the patient was gradually tapered off of the ivsolu-medrol and put on a p.o. prednisone taper starting at 80 mgp.o. q day. the pulmonary consult team saw her when she was backon the floor for her continued hemoptysis , but this appeared toresolve over the next couple of days , and , as a result , it wasdecided that this need not be pursued at the present. the patientdid well over the next several days and the day prior to dischargewas saturating at 94% on room air and received 10 mg of p.o.prednisone. the etiology of the patient's sudden decompensationwas never entirely clarified , but it appeared that flash pulmonaryedema was probably the most likely explanation , possibly due to aviral pneumonia in conjunction with fluid overload.medications on discharge: 1 ) tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.headache. 2 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. qday. 3 ) colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. 4 ) lasix 20 mg p.o. q otherday. 5 ) glucotrol 10 mg p.o. q day. 6 ) synthroid 125 microgramsp.o. q day. 7 ) lithium 300 mg p.o. q day. 8 ) cytotec 400micrograms p.o. t.i.d. 9 ) prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day. 10 )prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 11 ) inderal 20 mg p.o. q day. 12 )fosamax 10 mg p.o. q.a.m. 13 ) elavil 50 mg p.o. q.h.s.discharge disposition: the patient's discharge disposition is tohome with vna.follow-up plans: the patient is to follow-up with her primarycare doctor , dr. valentine hawf , if her weightincreases by more than two pounds , or if she has any furtherproblems. the patient is also to follow-up with him next week.the patient is also to follow-up with dr. avey from the cardiologygroup , as needed.condition on discharge: the patient's condition on discharge wasstable.dictated by: theodore nash , m.d. ui4attending: tyrell favre , m.d. xr5iv483/4374batch: 91604 index no. aniprk8xh4 d: 4/19/98t: 3/29/98[report_end]
