pacemaker ( 12/15/2001 ) picc line placement ( 12/18/2001 )history and reason for hospitalization :mr. sterpsap is a 43 year old male with prosthetic valve endocarditis .his history began in february

transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/3/01 showed possible vegetation on the valve and a mild perivalvular leak .he was transferred to a mariner nursing home to complete his six week course of intravenous antibiotics .he was referred back to dr. kote for redo aortic valve replacement .preoperative workup included a transesophageal echocardiogram on 11/23/01 showed rocking of the posterior sewing ring of the tilting disc valve .there was a 1.1 centimeter vegetation on the valve that prolapsed into left ventricle outflow tract during diastole .severe paravalvular aortic insufficiency was noted as well as a dilated , hypokinetic left ventricle and an ejection fraction of 45% .mr. sterpsap is scheduled for a redo-aortic valve replacement .pmh / psh :asthma , colonic polyps , anxiety ,
