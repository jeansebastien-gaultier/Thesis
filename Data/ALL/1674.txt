admission date :2013-05-14discharge date :2013-05-18date of birth :1953-07-27sex :fservice :cmed csruchief complaint :the patient was admitted originally for airway monitoring status post endoscopic retrogradecholangiopancreatography with adverse reaction to fentanyl and tongue injury .history of present illness :the patient is a 59 year-old female status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on the day of admission , which had been done to evaluate for possible bile leak after cholecystectomy was performed four days ago .the patient was in her usual state of health until four days prior to admission when she had a cholecystectomy .her postop course was uneventful until one day prior to admission when she developed abdominal pain .she went to an outside hospital emergency room and was reassured and sent home .on the day of admission she returned to the outside hospital emergency room where an abdominal ct was performed , which showed " thickened stomach and free air ."she was sent to new england sinai hospital & rehab center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possible stent placement .she had a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , which showed a bile leak at the duct of luschka .a stent was placed successfully .after her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the patient developed " jaw clenching , biting tongue , rigidity and cold / chills ."the patient received ampicillin , gentamycin and flagyl empirically as well as narcan to reverse fentanyl .because of the tongue injury and tachycardia as well as possible infection given her fevers or chills the gi service transferred the patient to the cmed ccu for close observation .past medical history :1. hiatal hernia .2. status post cholecystectomy four days prior to admission .3. urinary frequency secondary to interstitial cystitis .4. mitral valve prolapse .5. tubal ligation many years ago .medications on admission :1. prempro .2. cmed ccu drops .allergies :no known drug allergies at the time of admission , however , it is assumed that her rigidity and jaw clenching was secondary to fentanyl .social history :the patient is married .she works as a teacher 's aid in cambridge .she denies tobacco or alcohol use .physical examination on admission to the cmed ccu :vital signs temperature 100.6 .heart rate 105 .blood pressure 162/76 .respiratory rate 18 .sating 98% on 3 liters .in general , the patient was groggy status post anesthesia , shivering , but awake .heent showed tongue with laceration on the right edge .mucous membranes are moist .pupils are equal , round and reactive to light .extraocular movements intact .lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .heart regular rate and rhythm .no murmurs , rubs or gallops .abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .there were normoactive bowel sounds .there was no rebound or guarding .there were post laparoscopic incisions without erythema with steri-strips in place .the extremities were without edema .dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally .there were no rashes .laboratories on admission :white blood cell count 9.0 , hematocrit 39.3 , platelets 296 , neutrophil count 82 , lymphocytes 14 , 4 monocytes , troponin was less then 0.3 .sodium 139 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 101 , bicarb 26 , bun 9 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 141 , albumin 4.1 , calcium 8.9 , ldh 665 , ast 44 , alt of 57 , amylase 41 , ck 32 .electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per minute .there was normal axis .normal intervals .there were no st or t wave changes .abdominal ct showed inflammation in the right upper quadrant , small fluid in the circumferential thickening of the distal stomach .there was a question of a small ulcer .there was a tiny amount of free air .this was per report of vencor hospital .hospital course :in summary the patient is a 59 year-old female who was admitted to quincy medical center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for possible stent placement for a bile leak secondary to cholecystectomy performed four days prior to admission .she then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to fentanyl administration and was transferred to the cmed ccu for close observation .she did well overnight in the cmed ccu .she was started on ampicillin , gentamycin and flagyl .her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely .on the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective , so she was transferred to the general medical floor .1. gastrointestinal :as stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stentplacement for a bile leak from the duct of luschka .the patient was continued on ampicillin , gentamycin and flagyl , which had been started at the time of transfer to the cmed ccu .she had waxing and waning fevers .however , her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia .on the day of transfer to the general medical floor the patient had received clear liquids .she did not tolerate this very well .her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographywere elevated .amylase was 2304 with lipase being 7116 .therefore she was made npo and given aggressive intravenous hydration .on the second hospital day on the general medical floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen .she was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations .her amylase and lipase were trending down , however .an abdominal ct was obtained , which showed only mild pancreatitis .there were no intra-abdominal fluid collections , which required any drainage .on the third hospital day the patient 's pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing .her enzymes continued to trend down .she received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well .on the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a brat diet without significant abdominalpain .she had no further rebound .she had no temperature spikes in greater then 24 hours at the time of discharge .2. hematology :the patient 's hematocrit was 34.8 at the time of admission .it decreased to 30 in the setting of aggressive hydration .it remained stable at the time of discharge and it was 29.5 on the day of discharge .3. fen :the patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was npo .she required periodic repletion of her potassium .her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis .this was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids .this was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved .condition on discharge :stable .medications on discharge :1. levaquin 500 mg one po q day times seven days .2. protonix 40 mg po q day .3. percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn .the patient was given a prescription for ten pills .4. prempro as the patient was formerly taking .5. trazodone at bedtime .discharge follow up :the patient was to make an appointment with dr. nicholson within one to two months after discharge for removal of the stent .in addition , she would follow up with her primary care physician within one to two weeks following discharge .she was to continue on a brat diet over the weekend and two days after discharge she could advance to a low fat no dairy diet .she could slowly advance back to a normal diet over the next week .discharge diagnoses :1. post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis .2. anemia .3. hypokalemia .4. anion gap acidosis .5. bile leak .thompson ming li ,
