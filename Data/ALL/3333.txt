echo with ef equal to 65% here ,moderate diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonaryhypertension. no rhythm or ischemia issues during hospitalcourse , low hdl , started on statin.4. heme/normocytic anemia , likely secondary to gi bleed withevidence of iron deficiency. iron stores repleted with iv iron ,also possible anemia in setting of low epo. epo level checkedlow and normal , may ultimately benefit from epogen. on coumadinfor dvt prophylaxis/paroxysmal a-fib prior to arrival.supratherapeutic on admission , so coumadin held in the setting ofgi bleed until inr 1.5 , then patient was covered withsubcutaneous heparin for dvt prophylaxis. however , acute drop inplatelets in the setting of heparin from the 200s to the 30s , soheparin stopped. pf4 antibody negative x1 and borderline x1.pf4 antibody pending at the time of discharge , but all heparinproducts including flush is held. the patient restarted oncoumadin after egd at 12.5 mg a day. status post three doses ,inr was 2. target inr is 2-2.5 and the patient will be followedat the tarbripin of anticoagulation clinic , phonenumber is 915-360-5305. inrs can be faxed to clinic from rehaband adjustments in doses can be made accordingly.5. endo: tsh within normal limits. hemoglobin a1c 5.5 , so noevidence of diabetes.6. id: uti/proteus , levofloxacin renally dosed. repeat urinedirty , so p.o. cipro started for empiric treatment of uti insetting of indwelling foley. two days prior to discharge , thepatient with low-grade temp to max 100.4. chest x-ray unchangedbut only portable chest x-ray was obtained due to patient'simmobility , blood cultures and urine cultures were negative.empirically treating for nosocomial pneumonia with p.o.levo/cefpodox/azithro x10 days , picc line in place at time ofdischarge. however , it should be discontinued by 11/19/05 toprevent infection.7. allergy: postnasal drip. rhinorrhea. continued claritinand flonase.8. psyche: zoloft continued for depression.9. pulmonary: intermittent , the patient intermittentlydesaturates on room air to 80s but always resolved withrepositioning and o2. likely secondary to respiratory muscledeconditioning and to restrictive lung disease in the setting ofmorbid obesity. continuing flovent for asthma and albuterol nebsp.r.n. for wheezing. continue cpap at night for obstructivesleep apnea.10. oncology: history of breast mass last evaluated in 4/20 atwhich time the risk of surgery would determine to be greater thanthe possible risk of breast cancer. oncology not able to seepatient during inpatient stay but will schedule outpatientfollowup regarding the issue of possible treatment withtamoxifen.11. fen: gentle bowel regimen , renal diet.code status:full.key features of physical exam at the time of discharge:essentially unchanged from admission.discharge medications:include tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. , albuterol nebulizer 2.5mg inhaled q.6h. p.r.n. for shortness of breath and wheezing ,ecasa 81 mg p.o. daily , phoslo 667 mg p.o. t.i.d. , catapres 0.1mg per day q. weekly , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , metoprololtartarate 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , senna tablets two tabs p.o. b.i.d.p.r.n. for constipation , ocean spray two sprays inhaled q.i.d.p.r.n. for dry nose , coumadin 12.5 mg p.o. q.p.m. , zoloft 50 mgp.o. q.a.m. , azithromycin 250 mg p.o. daily x10 days , simvastatin20 mg p.o. at bedtime , doxazosin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , norvasc 5 mgp.o. daily , claritin 10 mg p.o. daily , flovent 110 mcg inhaledb.i.d. , cefpodoxime proxetil 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. x10 days , flonaseone spray daily , levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.24 x10 doses , andnexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.disposition:to rehab facility.followup:follow up with patient's primary care doctor , dr. gleen , andoncologist to be arranged , dates of appointments will beforwarded to rehab facility.escription document: 9-9678771 emssten telcc: carlton ahlstedt m.d.dictated by: laurion , robertattending: gorovitz , edgardictation id 0867345d: 1/20/05t: 1/20/05
