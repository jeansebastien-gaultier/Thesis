plan: this is a 69 year old gentleman with multiplecardiac risk factors , chronic anemia secondaryto severe hemorrhagic cystitis , no transfusion dependent , who wasadmitted with congestive heart failure after blood transfusion andpositive ck , mb. no definitive ekg changes and no clear history ofangina but recent history of increased pedal edema. the patientlikely had recent myocardial infarction and congestive heartfailure in the setting of transfusion.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the cardiac care unitfor further care. as mentioned above , heparinand aspirin were held secondary to the risk of worseninghemorrhagic cystitis. the patient received further bloodtransfusions to maintain a hematocrit greater than 30. he remainedin the cardiac care unit overnight. serial cks revealed an a setof 776 ( mb 70.5 ) , b set 747 ( mb 54.7 ) , c set 564 ( mb 33.2 ). ctniwas 25.1. ekg's were without evolution. the patient was thereforeruled in for a non q-wave myocardial infarction. an echocardiogramwas performed on 1/8/96 which showed normal lv function , mild lvh ,no regional wall motion abnormalities but of a somewhat suboptimalquality. the patient received a total of four units of red bloodcells with a subsequent rise in hematocrit from 17 to 30.1 by thefirst hospital day and received initially 40 mg of iv lasix in theemergency room , followed by two doses of 20 mg with excellent urineoutput.the patient was transferred from the ccu to general medicalservice , scogard on his second hospital day , 10/25/96. his post micourse was uncomplicated , notable only for two runs ofnon-sustained ventricular tachycardia overnight on the firsthospital day. the patient had no recurrent angina and no recurrentevidence of congestive heart failure.he underwent a routine post mi submax ett on 1/22/96. the patientwent 4 minutes and 4 seconds with a peak work load of 31 , peakheart rate of 80 , and peak blood pressure of 160/80. he stoppedsecondary to fatigue. he occasional pvc's but no chest pain and nost changes. the test was thought to show no evidence of ischemiabut had a low work load. it was thought appropriate to dischargethe patient to home for further medical management and furtherurologic workup as an outpatient. the most important medicalintervention would be to keep his hematocrit greater than 30 withvigilant monitoring. during this admission , the patient received atotal of six units of packed red cells. and had a hematocrit of30.9 on discharge.from a urologic standpoint , the patient was followed by urologyduring his hospitalization , who felt that his condition wassecondary to radiation cystitis. given that he was now havinghematuria to the extent of requiring frequent transfusions , surgeryi.e. a urinary diversion with ileal conduit , will most likely benecessary in the near future. he will continue to follow-up withurology as an outpatient.discharge medications: ferrous sulfate 300 mg p.o. q.day , folicacid 1 mg p.o. q.day , glyburide 10 mg p.o.b.i.d. , lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sublingual nitroglycerinp.r.n. chest pain.condition on discharge: the patient was discharged in goodcondition and will follow-up with dr. arthur matney and also with dr. silos as well as urology.dictated by: napoleon t. weyler , m.d. vz16attending: korey ashbaugh , m.d. gc6eb831/7062batch: 30673 index no. x5julc44l1 d: 7/12/96t: 4/24/96[report_end]
