complaint: dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity swelling.history of present illness: the patient is a 61-year-old male withhistory of diabetes and ischemiccardiomyopathy who presents on 5/22/01 with increased shortness ofbreath and fatigue. his cardiac history began in 1980 , when hesuffered from an myocardial infarction and had a second myocardialinfarction in 1986. he had a 3 vessel coronary artery bypass graftin 1987 with a lima-left anterior descending , saphenous vein graftto om and saphenous vein graft to the pda. the patient developeddecreasing functional status postoperatively and recentechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%.in march 2000 , mr. straight was admitted to the luke's medical center with chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion andfatigue. cardiac catheterization at that time showed native 3vessel disease with occlusion of his venous graft to his obtusemarginal and posterior descending arteries. on that admission , mr.etling was aggressively diuresed and post discharge , he was able tocomplete his normal activities of daily living with no shortness ofbreath or chest pain. over the several months prior to admission ,however , mr. knoeppel noted progressive worsening of shortness ofbreath , dyspnea on exertion and fatigue , such that , on the day ofadmission , he reported that he could not walk from his driveway tohis house without symptoms. he reported no baseline orthopnea , butstates he does have paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.past medical history: significant for coronary artery disease ,history of gallstones , hypothyroidism ,nephrolithiasis , cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.past surgical history: significant only for the coronary arterybypass graft in 1987.family history: his father died of an myocardial infarction in his50s. his mother also died of an myocardialinfarction in her 70s.medications on admission: 1. captopril 37.5 t.i.d. 2. isordil30 t.i.d. 3. digoxin .125 q. day. 4.synthroid .25 q. day. 5. lipitor 20 q. day. 6. torsemide 80b.i.d. 7. coumadin 4 mg monday/wednesday/friday , 5 mg other days.8. nph 40 units b.i.d.physical examination: on admission , temperature 97 , pulse 69 ,blood pressure 100/70 , respiratory rate 16 ,satting 92% on room air. neck examination revealed jugular venouspressure , elevated behind the ear and approximately 27 mm withpositive hepatojugular reflux. the lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. cardiovascular examination revealedregular rate and rhythm with frequent ectopy , positive s3 and pmiin the midaxillary line. abdomen was benign. extremities showedno lower extremity edema with 1+ distal pulses and warm to thetouch.laboratory data: significant for a sodium of 146 , bun 16 ,creatinine 1.3 , hematocrit 36 , inr 1.4.ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 67 with left axis deviation ,right bundle branch block and q-waves in leads 2 , 3 and avf.chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the cardiology ohioservice for diuresis and possible inotropesupport. he was diuresed over the course of 10 days usingtorsemide 80 mg iv t.i.d. and his captopril was gradually increasedas tolerated to a maximum dose of 75 mg t.i.d. the patientdiuresed without difficulty and by the time of discharge , he hadweighed a dry weight of approximately 96 kilograms.the patient was also evaluated for possible heart transplant.work-up was extensive and included an echocardiogram on 2/27/01 ,which showed an ejection fraction of 15-20% with global hypokinesisand akinesis of the inferior septal walls with moderate mitralregurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. abdominalultrasound on 2/27/01 , revealed probable cardiac cirrhosis. aliver spleen scan on 11/9/01 , was consistent with mild cardiaccirrhosis , as was an mri of the liver on 10/28/01 .  as a result ,the patient was not considered a candidate for transplant.pulmonary function tests on 1/0/01 , revealed a dlco = 14 , whichwas 49% of expected. on 8/26/01 , the patient underwent adobutamine mibi stress test that was consistent with a moderatelyenlarged area of prior myocardial infarction of the left circumflexterritory and posterior descending artery territories. theexamination was also suggestive with an area of modest dobutamineinduced ischemia in the territory of the left anterior descendingwith preserved viability.endocrine wise , the patient's diabetes was managed in-house on aregular insulin sliding scale. because his hemoglobin a1c levelwas below 6 on discharge , he was placed back on his regiment of nph40 units b.i.d. in terms of his thyroid , we made no adjustments tohis levoxyl regiment. he has been coumadinized for a low ejectionfraction and was discharged on his regular regiment of 4 mgmonday/wednesday/friday and 5 mg on all other days.the patient also has a history of depression and he was maintainedon prozac 20 mg q. day.hematologically , the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 36during his hospitalization. his mcv = 75.1 in a 61-year-old malewith necrocytic anemia. we obtained a colonoscopy which revealedpolyps , all of which were snagged with no complications. thepathologies are currently pending.the patient was discharged on 6/15/01 , having diuresed to a dryweight of 96 kilograms and plan to follow-up with dr. goltra on9/5/01 . dictated
