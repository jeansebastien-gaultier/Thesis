and[2131-9-26], there is significant improvement inwidespread parenchymal opacities with the current studyrepresenting mild interstitial pulmonary edema. there is smallfocal opacity in the left upper lung and left lower lobe whichmight reflect partial resolution of the infectious process.hilar enlargement is bilateral, unchanged and might potentiallycorrespond to hilar lymphadenopathy, although pulmonaryenlargement might be another possibility.  there is noappreciable pleural effusion, and there is no pneumothorax..portable tte (complete) done [2131-9-24] at 3:06:14 pmimpression: moderate

bacteremia from picc on daptomycin (lastdose [2131-9-24]), who was admitted with hypoglycemia related to anincrease in her antihypoglycemic medications, with coursecomplicated by viral pneumonia and respiratory distress, nowresolved..active issues:.# hypoglycemia: her presentation was related to aggressiveincrease in oral hypoglycemics, after her hypoglycemicmedication dosages had been recently increased. she was treatedwith d50 iv and her anti-hypoglycemics were held, glucosenormalized and her mental status returned to baseline. she wasmaintained on a sliding scale insulin while in hospital.  shewas discharged on antihypoglycemic regimen from prior tomedication increases prior to admission. we recommend continuedmonitoring of her finger glucose and gradually increaseglipizide or pioglitazone as needed..# viral pneumonia: on [2131-9-23], the patient was triggered fortachypnea and increased work of breathing. her cxr wasconcerning for hcap as well as vascular congestion. patientreceived 20mg of iv lasix as well as nebs. antibiotics broadenedto cefepime, but had persistent tachypnea, with cxrdemonstrating worsening bilateral infiltrates. again receivednebs, lasix 20mg iv (last dose at mn) with uop 1l. she continuedto have worsening respiratory function and was transferred tothe micu in obvious respiratory distress with accessory muscleuse and audible grunting. the decision was made to electivelyintubate with anesthesia/respiratory at bedside. duringintubation patient paralyzed with succ with initial transienthypotension to the 70s. uncomplicated intubation performed andpatient sedated with propofol and fentanyl.  the cause of herrespiratory decompensation was probably multifactorial.  herantibiotics were broadened to linezolid/cefepime/levofloxacinfor possible multifocal pneumonia.  given cxr evidence ofbilateral pulmonary edema, cardiogenic source was suspected andshe was diuresed.  tte revealed normal left ventricular functionbut right ventricular overload thought to be related to heracute pneumonic process.  she underwent bronchoscopy on [2131-9-24]which revealed +yeast, +pmn, and +rhinovirus, but no pcp orbacteria.  her rhinovirus may have contributed to her diffuseinflammatory process.  pcp was [name initial (pre) ] concern due to herunprophylaxed chronic steroid load of 30mg prednisone daily, andindeed a beta glucan was positive, though this was felt torepresent her candidida from her lung.  her linezolid andcefepime were discontinued, and she was continued onlevofloxacin 8d course for possible bacterial suprainfection.she was successfully extubated on [9-26] and transferred to themedicine service on [9-27], where she completed levofloxacincourse, oxygen staturation remained in the upper 90's on roomair, she ambulated the [doctor last name ] without dyspnea. she was dischargedwith dextromethorphan-guaifenesin as needed for cough..# acute kidney injury: baseline creatinine 0.7, she was admittedwith creatinine 1.8 related to dehydration. lisinopril was held,she was treated with intervenous fluids and her creatinineimproved. lisinopril was resumed..# rash: diffuse livido reticularis appearing rash. she was seenby dermatology and it was felt to be a reaction to hervancomycin, and she was switched to daptomycin and started ontopical triamcinolone and hydrocortisone and the rash improved..# urinary tract infection: her urine culture revealedpan-sensitive e. coli and klebsiella, which was treated with herlevofloxacin regimen she took for possible bacterialsuprainfection of her viral pneumonia..# mrsa bacteremia: high-grade bacteremia believed to be [1-31] toprior picc now removed or endocarditis for which she was tocomplete a 6 weeks of vancomycin on [2131-9-24]. she was switchedto daptomycin on [9-17] following the onset of a new rash thatwas believed to be vancomycin-related, and completed daptomycincourse on [9-24]..# leukocytosis: throughout hospital course, wbc ranged 9-19, theday prior to discharge, wbc had trended up to 15 from 13. shewas kept an additional night and a basic infectious workup wasperformed. chest xray looked improved, ua was negative, andblood cultures showed no growth in 24 hours. the followingmorning ([2131-10-2]), wbc trended to 13, she was clinically wellappearing and was discharged. leukocyutosis is likely related toprednisone.# crohns disease:  increased prednisone to 40mg, and have sinceresumed home 30mg dose.  started on atovaquone for pcp[name initial (pre) 1102]..# tb treatment: prior to admission, patient had indeterminantquantiferon gold test.patient was continued on treatment forltbi with isoniazid/b6 day #1 = [2131-8-16] for 9 months.  thesemedicaitons should be discontinued after the 9 month course

care proxy and [name2 (ni) ] improved. no signs of serotoninsyndrome..# hepatitis b: patient is hep b surface antigen positive.continued home dose lamivudine 100 mg daily..# hypertension: held
