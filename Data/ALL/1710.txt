1. syncope.2. orthostatic hypotension.3. ischemic cardiomyopathy.4. diabetes mellitus.5. coronary artery disease.history of present illness: this is a 62-year-old white male withinsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy who wasadmitted with syncope. he is status post myocardial infarction in1979 and 1985 as well as a coronary artery bypass graft in 1987with a lima to lad , svg to rca , svg to omb. over the past tenyears he has complained of increasing chf symptoms includingdyspnea on exertion , fatigue , chest tightness and has had multipleadmits for exacerbations , the most recent from november tomarch , 2001 for progressive fatigue. at that time a rightheart catheterization revealed high filling pressures and he wastreated with aggressive diuresis. angiography revealed occludedsvgs and a patent lima. dobutamine radionuclide study revealedinferior and inferolateral infarct. there was no evidence ofrevascularization. evaluation for heart transplant found cirrhosisby liver spleen scan which ruled out the possibility of transplant.he reported light-headedness and dizziness and was seen by theelectrophysiology service who performed an ep study which wasnegative for provokable vt and since he is not a transplantcandidate it was felt that empiric icd placement would not be inhis best interest. his light-headedness and presyncope worsened.his captopril dose was reduced from 37.5 mg to 25 mg t.i.d. withmarked improvement in his energy and less dizziness. over the pastweeks his dizziness and light-headedness recurred and worsened withepisodes of presyncope and frank syncope. on the day of admissionhe was scheduled for a clinic appointment. on arrival he feltdizzy and "crumpled" with loss of consciousness and therefore wasadmitted for further evaluation.past medical history: ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejectionfraction of 15% to 20% in february of 2001 ,status post anterior mi in 1980 and 1986 , three vessel cabg in 1987with lima to lad , svg to om and svg to pda , type 2 diabetesmellitus , insulin dependent , hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis ,gallstones , cardiac cirrhosis which is mild and was diagnosed infebruary 2001 by abdominal ultrasound and liver scan , ibs , psoriasis.admission medications: captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , isordil 40 mgp.o. t.i.d. , lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , nphinsulin 65 units subcu b.i.d. , xanax p.r.n. , torsemide 120 mg p.o.q.a.m. , torsemide 80 mg p.o. q.p.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,synthroid 250 mcg p.o. q.d. , prozac 20 mg p.o. q.d.allergies: no known drug allergies.admission physical examination: vital signs: lying blood pressure94/58 , heart rate 70 , oxygensaturation 97% on room air. sitting blood pressure 78/54. patientcould not stand secondary to light-headedness to completeorthostatic vital signs. afebrile. general: appearingcomfortable in a supine position. no acute distress.cardiovascular: regular. normal s1 , s2. no s3. jvpapproximately 5 cm. a ii/vi holosystolic murmur at apex. lungs:clear to auscultation bilaterally. abdomen: soft , non-tender ,nondistended. no hepatosplenomegaly. extremities: no edema.admission laboratory data: sodium 128 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 91 ,bicarbonate 22 , bun 64 , creatinine 2.6 ,glucose 348. white blood cell count 17.9 , hematocrit 37.6 ,platelets 286.operations and procedures: none.hospital course: this is a 62-year-old white male with history ofinsulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronaryartery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy and probably cardiaccirrhosis who presents with presyncope and syncope. the arrhythmiawas considered possible and there has been none documented and hewas not inducible two years prior to admission. given hisorthostatic vital signs it was felt that his volume status andmedications were responsible for his symptoms. in addition hiselevated bun and creatinine were consistent with volume depletion.he improved off diuretics , nitrates and ace inhibitor as well asliberalization of his diet regarding salt and fluid intake. therewere no arrhythmias noted on his telemetry monitor. an endocrineconsult was called to evaluate for possible contribution ofautonomic insufficiency secondary to his diabetes mellitus. theyrecommended decreasing his synthroid dose due to a suppressed tshas well as more aggressive blood sugar control , however , they wereunable to document orthostatic hypotension and felt that hisepisodes of presyncope and syncope were related to his volumestatus and medications rather than autonomic insufficiency.discharge medications: to be dictated on the actual day ofdischarge.condition on discharge: satisfactory.disposition: home with services.follow-up: primary care
