lima to the lad , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal artery .subsequent to this , the patient was transferred to the crsu for closer monitoring .he was deemed to be too lethargic and sleepy to be extubated on postoperative day number zero .the patient was extubated early on postoperative day number one without significant complication .he remained in atrial fibrillation .the ep service was consulted regarding the patient 's atrial fibrillation .this was his main issue in the postoperative course .he was attempted on multiple different drugs including procainamide , diltiazem , esmolol , sotalol , amiodarone .the patient was kept therapeutically anticoagulated throughout this period .the patient was also started on digoxin .ultimately , the patient was transferred to the floor and anticoagulation with coumadin was begun .the patient arrived on the floor with medications as follows :sotalol 180 mg b.i.d. , diltiazem 90 mg q.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.while the patient was awaiting therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin , he spontaneously converted into normal sinus rhythm .the patient was found to have a resting heart rate of approximately 50 subsequent to this .in consultation with the ep service , diltiazem was stopped .after approximately 24 hours , the patient converted back into atrial fibrillation and diltiazem was restarted at 60 mg q.i.d.the patient then had one more episode where he was converted to normal sinus rhythm but this lasted only a few hours before reverting back to atrial fibrillation .the patient was ultimately discharged on postoperative day number 16 , tolerating a regular diet , and adequate pain control on p.o. pain medications , having no anginal symptoms and with an inr of 2.0 .the patient failed multiple attempts at cardioversion .discharge condition :stable .inr 2.0.disposition :to home .diet :cardiac .discharge medications :1. percocet 5/325 mg one to two q. four hours p.r.n.2. aspirin 325 mg q.d.3. colace 100 mg b.i.d.4. coumadin 5 mg q.d.5. sotalol 180 mg b.i.d.6. digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.7. diltiazem 60 mg q.i.d.8. ambien 5-10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n.discharge instructions :the patient should follow-up with his cardiologist in one to two weeks .he will also go home with vna for inrs twice weekly with the results reported to his pcp or cardiologist for coumadin adjustment .the patient should follow-up with dr. halcomb in six weeks time .octavia w. levitre , m.d. 05-383dictated by : james q. mitchell , m.d.medquist36d : 2010-03-28 10:15t : 2010-03-28 10:46job # : 41466signed electronically by : dr. janice carpenter on : andrea 2010-04-01 8:20 am( end of report )
