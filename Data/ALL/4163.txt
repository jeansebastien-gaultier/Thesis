episode of syncope.   1. syncope: most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  it is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  however, the sudden onset of his syncope and loc for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  ischemic event is less likely in this man.  ekg showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known mr evidenced on his tte in 2090.other possible causes include:  	neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  however, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.  	others: finger stick glucose on the field 130, and hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  plan:1)	continue hydration overnight. 2)     tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.3)     continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.4)     tte to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.5)     tcd and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.2. dm: pt diagnosed with type 2 dm approximately 12 years ago.  seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  per pt, the last hgba1c was in 5-6 range.  1)	diabetic diet, rssi.2)     q6h finger stick check.3)     check hgba1c in am.3. l ankle swelling: most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  tender to palpation and with joint movement.  no signs of infection.  good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.1)	l ankle plain films to rule out fracture.2)     pt consult.4. fen: electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low mg (1.5).  eating po.  on ivf for hydration.1)	replete mg.  2)     k now 3.6.  if low in am, replete for the goal of 4.3)     diabetic diet for nutrition.5. prophylaxis: ranitidine, heparin. 8. dispo: pt consult.  anticipate home discharge.______________________________________________________________________name     shawn ott                          pager 	# 56770pgy-1
