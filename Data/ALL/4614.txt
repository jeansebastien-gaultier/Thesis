respects theradiographic appearance of these severely scarred andbronchiectatic lungs, as well as bilateral pleural abnormalitiesare unchanged over the long-term. there are no findings tosuggest acute pneumonia or pulmonary edema.brief hospital course:76 yo male with end stage sarcoidosis presenting with dyspnea..# hypercarbic respiratory failure: pt presented to the er withincreased shortness of breath over 24hrs, tachycardia, andgeneralized fatigue. similar prior presentations were felt to berelated to sarcoid flares. cxr showed end stage pulmonaryfibrosis but no other abnormalities. it was felt his sx likelyrepresented pneumonia in setting of severe underlying fibroticlung disease. pt was unable to sustain high minute ventilatoryrate, evidenced by a rising pco2 and thus required emergentintubation shortly after arrival to icu. the patient was treatedfor presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin and meropenem givenleukocytosis and dyspnea. infectious work-up including multipleblood cultures and viral cultures were negative.  the patientwas not given steroids since it was felt that his sx wererelated to an infectious process rather than a flair of hissarcoid lung disease. the patient was made dnr after talkingwith the son. ip consult was sought for trach placement giventhe patient's inability to wean off the ventilator withsubsequent placement of tracheostomy and peg on [1-26] and [1-27]respectively. pt tolerated trach mask well. he was transferredto the floor on [2-3]. later that afternoon he was noted todesat into the 50's with increased work of breathing and wasrequiring high levels of nursing care. he was transferred backto the micu where he again experienced agitation and increasedwork of breathing. he was placed back on the vent on psovernight and tolerated this well and eventually was able totransition to trach mask throughtout the day and night. clinicaldecompensation attributed to mucus plugging.# chronic orthostatic hypotension: pt normotensive on admissionto icu. his home medications of midodrine and fludricortisonewere continued while admitted.# agitation: the patient had issues with agitation especially atnight. geriatrics was consulted and a regimen of seroquel wasinitiated as well as efforts to limit lines and to orient himfrequently. his mental status waxed and waned and he fell out ofbed twice but sustained no injuries. by [2-1] his delirium hadimproved on a regimen of seroquel to 12.5 mg [hospital1 ], seroquel 25 mgqhs and seroquel 25mg prn. upon readmission to the micu,however, he again became significantly agitated and required ivhaldol in addition to his scheduled seroquel. ekg the followingmorning did not show any eveidence of prolonged qt.  pergeriatric recommendations the pt's seroquel was increased to50mg qhs and his sundowning improved. qtc was noted to 419 ondischarge dose of seroquel..the patient was on subq heparin for dvt prophylaxis and ppi forstress ulcer prophylaxis.

he failed swallowing test twice with concern foraspiration.  peg tube was placed and his tube feeds wereadvanced to goal rate of 35 cc/hr.  medium chain trigylcerideswere added for coloric help..follow up at rehab1. sundowning: [month (only) 116] increase his schedule dose of seroquel [hospital1 ]and qhs. his qtc on current dose is only 419.  please check ekgafter increasing his dose to
