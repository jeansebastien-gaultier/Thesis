a fibroid .the ovaries were not seen on the abdominal ultrasound .hospital course :cardiac :the patient had no prior history of cardiac disease .although the chest pain that she had could have represented ischemia , there was a low clinical suspicion for this .it was most likely felt that the patient 's chest pain was reflective of her abdominal gastroenteritis .however , she was admitted

:the patient presented with diffuse abdominal pain which was more pronounced in the left lower quadrant , nausea and vomiting .the differential diagnosis for this was felt to be a viral gastroenteritis , diverticulitis , degenerating fibroid , ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease .although the patient had cervical motion tenderness on admission physical exam , the gynecology service felt that the pelvic inflammatory disease was an unlikely diagnosis in this setting because the patient has had a tubal ligation in the past .the patient had an abdominal and pelvic ct scan at which time the ovaries were identified and were felt to be unremarkable .additionally , the uterus itself was felt to be normal .no diverticula were seen on the ct scan and no abscess was

leukocytosis .however , blood cultures were drawn on admission .the patient had a total of four sets of blood cultures drawn .one set of blood cultures grew out group b strep and staph epi .as the patient was afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count , it was suspected that these cultures results were most likely a contaminant .two additional sets of blood cultures were drawn and the

was observed and remained afebrile .gynecologic :the patient had perimenopausal symptoms at the time of admission with hot flashes and irregular menstrual cycles .a fsh level was drawn and is pending at the time of dictation .the gynecology service would like to have follow-up with the patient for routine gynecologic exam , pap smear and estrogen replacement counseling in approximately three
