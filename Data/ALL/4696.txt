with a history of hcv cirrhosis and hcc,osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, whopresented to or for elective rfa as outpatient today and wasfound to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration ofsedatives for intubation. her ekg was concerning for stdepressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponinelevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with noangiographical flow limiting disease..active issues:# hypotension: pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.  per pacunotes, she received propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl; shewas subsequently treated with ivfs, glycopyrrolate, andneosynephrine with bp subsequently rising to 80s-90s.  volumedepletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had beennpo since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive inpacu. she received additional fluid boluses in the icu, butstill required dopamine temporarily overnight following herprocedure. she was quickly weaned off and she maintained herblood pressure in the 90's-100's systolic afterwards..# bradycardia: this was also thought to be likely from agentsgiven for induction, particularly propofol and  succinylcholine. she also received esmolol after she became tachycardic fromglycopyrrolate.  her bradycardia resolved over 24 hours..# st depressions: ekg showed st depressions in lead v3-v6 thatwere new from prior, in setting of bradycardia and hypotension.her repeat ekg later showed resolution of st depressions.  ptwas evaluated by cardiology who felt that st depressions werelikely from demand ischemia from hypotension and bradycardia.she had a troponin elevation to trop elevated to 0.32 with mildmb elevation to 8. given that the patient is being evaluated fortransplantation, she underwent a cardiac catheterization whichrevealed non significant coronary artery disease. she also had atte which showed ef >55%, trace ar and mr..chronic issues:# hcc: pt with hcv cirrhosis that is well-compensated (childs[doctor last name 14477] a).  she has no history of jaundice, encephalopathy,ascites, or esophageal varices.  she will need to have her rfarescheduled and will require an anesthesia evaluation prior tothe procedure..# osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin d.# tobacco abuse: pt was supplied a nicotine patch while inhospital.transitional issues:# blood cultures were pending at time of discharge..# pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, howeverpt was clinically well and asymptomatic. no antibiotics werestarted but would have low threshold to initiate treatment forpneumonia if pt develops symptoms..# pt will need to have her rfa rescheduled. she should have apre-op evaluation by anesthesia to determine the safety of theprocedure.medications on admission:alprazolam 0.25mg prn anxietyvitamind2  1.25mg (50,000units) once weeklyevista 60mg dailysumatriptan 50mg prncalcium with
