.she has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .pulses are fine .imaging :x-rays were reviewed .they showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .recommendations :dr. etteme overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on february 2 , 2003 .hospital course :please refer to the operative note by dr. etteme overall for details of the procedure .postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .it was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .however , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest x-ray , which essentially was normal .an abg revealed a normal pco2 of 32 , but a decrease in po2- at 62 .therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral ct scan and the medicine service was consulted at that time .they agreed with our plan .on spiral ct scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .she was started on heparin at that time to maintain a ptt of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of coumadin , in addition to the coumadin she had been given for dvt prophylaxis .with the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an inr of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .she continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .she was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .she was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .she was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .she continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an inr of 2.0 to 3.0 .medications on discharge :the patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on coumadin therapy .1. colace , 100 mg. po t.i.d.2. percocet , one to two tablets po q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .3. coumadin with a target inr of 2.0 to 3.0 .please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .the patient will be on coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .discharge plan :coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target inr of 2.0 to 3.0 .check inr three times a week until stable .please call the results to dr. viennee ester , the patient
