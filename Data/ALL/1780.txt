medical records from pennsylvania hospitalcc:  chest painhpi:mr. eubanks is a 68 year-old man with hypertension, mild diabetes mellitus type ii, and gout who presents with 2 hours of burning chest pain prominent in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of the back.  in addition to htn and dm, mr. eubanks    cardiac risk factors include a family history of cad (brother, sister) and prior history of mild, spontaneously resolving chest pain in early 2147.  he received a cardiac workup for the chest pain including baseline ekg, exercise tolerance test, and myoview study.  baseline ekg was unremarkable with normal sinus rhythm but the ett was positive with inverted t waves, st segment downsloping depressions in the anterolateral and inferior leads, and pvc   s in recovery.  the patient had no chest pain and good exercise capacity during the ett, which was terminated after 9 minutes because of leg fatigue.  on the myoview study, a small area of ischemia with possibly minimal scaring was noted in the inferior wall although wall motion was normal.  estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 62%.  a subsequent exercise echo was normal.  baseline blood pressures at the time of the workup measured 160/68 with systolic pressures noted as high as 180.  his blood pressure has been since controlled on atenolol and was measured per patient account to be around 148/80 at his most recent visit to his pcp in august.  hemoglobin a1c in 2147 was 6.2 and diabetes has been managed with only diet.   he was previously using daily aspirin but stopped in october 2148 for a dermatologic surgery and did not restart.  mr. eubanks was in his usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission when he developed two episodes of low grade chest pain, once in the morning and once in the evening.  these episodes lasted only 1-2 minutes, and seemed to him to be related to his ongoing issues with gout.  the chest pain was not associated with shortness of breath and seemed to improve with indomethacin, which he typically takes for acute exacerbations of gout.  his course over the next two days was unremarkable and he went to bed comfortable the night prior to admission.  he was awakened near 3 am by 8/10 burning chest pain and pressure in the left anterior chest and radiating to both arms and to the center of his back but not to the neck or jaw.  associated with the chest pain were chills and a feeling of increased heart rate although the patient denies shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, headache, lightheadedness, fever, or vision changes.  the pain persisted for 2 hours without improvement or alleviating factors, prompting the patient to have his wife drive him to bbh ed from his cheney home.  review of systems was positive for polyuria, increased thirst, mild non-productive cough, post-nasal drip, and intermittent mild diarrhea in past months.  the patient denies recent or past history of edema, gerd, claudication, clots, hemoptysis, hematemesis, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, wheezing, fatigue, appetite or weight changes, or night sweats.  in the emergency department, the patient was given aspirin, lopressor, sublingual nitroglycerin, and 2l o2 by nasal cannula, and chest pain subsequently resolved.  ekg on presentation showed a poor baseline in sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy.  subsequent ekg   s revealed continued pvc   s and pac   s with biphasic t-waves in v4-5.  a chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or acute chf and showed no evidence of widened mediastinum.  ct scans with and without contrast which were negative for aortic dissection.  cardiac enzymes x 2 sets were negative, but d-dimer was elevated at 816.  stool sample was guiac positive, although cbc was stable with hct 44.6.  pmh:  hypertension, treated with atenololdiabetes mellitus type ii, managed with dietgout, treated with colchicine and indomethacinbasal

severe chest pain.  the differential for chest pain is broad and includes cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolus, bronchitis, pleurisy, gerd/esophageal spasm, musculoskeletal/chest wall pain, and anxiety.  the sudden onset of severe chest pain, awaking him from sleep, raises the probability of an acute cardiac or pulmonary event such as mi, aortic dissection, or pe.  the patient has elevated d-dimer but otherwise lacks physical exam findings (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, signs of dvt) or ct/cta imaging features consistent with pulmonary embolism.  the patient   s htn is a risk factor for aortic dissection, but this diagnosis can be ruled out by negative cxr and cta scans, which have 80     95% sensitivity.  in addition, he lacks a number of other clinical manifestations of dissection, including syncope, pulse deficits, and new murmur.  the distribution of the pain is anginal in distribution and is relieved by nitroglycerin + aspirin.  moreover, the patient has had two similar but less severe attacks a few days ago, and has multiple cardiac risk factors.  this makes unstable angina or myocardial infarction the most likely diagnosis.  ekg changes lacked st segment elevation, although t-wave inversions were present in some leads.   the patient   s cardiac enzymes were negative from the ed x 2 sets with a third troponin negative on the floor.  the patient may have either a non-st elevation mi or unstable angina.  the plan will be to continue monitoring closely for chest pain and ekg changes, with the next step likely to involve stress test or catheterization in the morning tomorrow.  cardiology is following closely and has provided recommendations that are incorporated into the plan.  plan:  1.  chest paintelemetry, cardiac monitortroponin, ck, ck-mb q8h x 3ldh on next drawekg if chest pain reemerges or in am if no chest pain flareasa 325 mg po

the pt is a 67m w htn gout and dm who woke up at 3am today with chest pressure and pain that radiated to both arms. he did feel slightly sob but there was no n, v, diaphoresis or lightheadedness at this time. the episode lasted less than one minute and he felt better after he took indomethacin. upon further questioning, he thinks he had two similar episodes last week. he has not had any doe, pnd, or le edema. he does recall having chest pressure and chest pain in feb 2147 when he had a    cardiac evaluation    at the pennsylvania hospital. he does not know the details of the workup. of note the pt does not smoke, is not on asa, and has several family members with cad but no men <55 or women<65. he is on atenolol     but unsure of the dose. in the ed, he did have some chest pain but it was relieved after 1 nitro. hr was 85 and bp 135/82. he was given asa and a bb. initially, his ekg was read as normal but later the t waves became biphasic in leads v4-6. repeat ekgs when he was chest pain free, showed flipped ts in v4-6. there were no old ekgs available for comparison. he was seen by cardiology who recommended holding off on heparin bolus as he was found to be guaiac + (hct 44). a dissection protocol ct was performed and was neg for dissection and for a central pe. (the ddimer was elevated). his first two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative and he was sent to the floor for further evaluation. on exam, he was in nad and was cp free. heart was rrr, lungs ctab and he had no lower extremity edema. asa and bb were cont. the third set of cardiac enzymes came back negative and the pt was scheduled for a stress test. however, the patient did experience some chest discomfort this morning and therefore cardiology felt it was best to take him to cath instead. this is planned for this morning. please note this pt is allergic to allopurinol. v. a. nunes md 32043internal medicine intern
