she may benefit from a trial of advair.4.  chronic renal insufficiency.  creatinine at baseline of 3.2.  she will need to be watched closely.  she expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.  there has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.  i think this must have been done at brookwood hospital because no studies are available in the hh system.  dr. dougherty had done mra a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.  she is scheduled to see dr. dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.  her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the hh ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.  she is quite fond of dr. dougherty who has cared for her for years, but i think given the complexity of medical care.  this might not be a bad idea.  she is going to discuss with dr. dougherty and i will e-mail dr. dougherty as well.5.  gi.  she was noted to have barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.6.  heme.  her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.  she needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.  she is scheduled to see hematology at stone-wheeling in january.  in the meantime,  i have spoken to dr. dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the renal department at st. mary's.  if necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.  i will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to dr. dougherty.7.  health care maintenance.  labs today.  h1n1 vaccine today.  son, brendon ambrose is her healthcare proxy and i have put his name in the advanced directive file on the lmr.  she wishes to be full code at present.  i will see her again in 4 weeks.visit length 60 minutes.______________________________wendy p nowak, m.d.escription document:2-22566361 cssten teldd: 12/12/79dt: 12/12/79dv: 12/12/79
