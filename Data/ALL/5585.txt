[dueto acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation maybe significantly underestimated.] the mitral valve leaflets aremildly thickened. moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate tosevere [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. there is moderatepulmonary artery systolic hypertension. the pulmonic valveleaflets are thickened. there is no pericardial effusion.impression: critical aortic stenosis. moderate symmetric leftventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolicfunction. moderate mitral regurgitation. moderate to severetricuspid regurgitation. moderate pulmonary hypertension.compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [2144-2-13],the calculated aortic valve area is smaller. the severity oftricuspid regurgitation has increased. the previously seen smallsecundum asd is not well-visualized..chest (portable ap) study date of [2146-2-2] 7:47 amfindings: in comparison with the study of [2-1], there is littleinterval change on this somewhat limited study. enlargement ofthe cardiac silhouette persists with bibasilar atelectaticchange. there is suggestion of gas within a hiatal hernia. noevidence of acute focal pneumonia.brief hospital course:[age over 90 ] year old female with past medical history significant forcad, critical as, and radiation proctitis presenting after afall with a humeral fracture and hypotension following opiates..# hypotension: patient was found to be hypotensive in the edafter coming back from radiology study.  the etiologies for herhypotension were thought to be related to pain-medications andcritical as.  patient was given gental iv fluid boluses afterbeing admitted to ccu.  patient's blood pressure continued to below, systolics in the 60s and 70s, during the rest of herhospital stay.  pressors were avoided given her severe as.because of hypotension, she developed acute renal failurerapidly (creatinine bumped from 0.9 to 2.9 in 2 days).  patientdeclined hemodialysis, also denied avr or valvuloplasty, soafter extensive discussions with patient's hcp (her son, [name (ni) ][name (ni) 10166]), decision was made to make patient comfort measures only.she expired on day 3 of her hospital stay from acute renalfailure and electrolyte abnormalities..# critical as: the patient had a previous valve area of 0.7cm2.she underwent a repeat tte which showed critical aortic valvestenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  she declined avr orvalvuloplasty.  she expired on [2146-2-2] in the setting ofcritical as, hypotension and acute renal failure..# acute renal failure: baseline cr difficult to assess from labsbut appeared to be around 0.6-0.7.  patient's creatinine was 0.9on admission, likely prerenal in the context of appearing dry.no recent antibiotics or other nephrotoxins, and no symptoms ofuti with benign ua.  patient was hypotensive during her hospitalstay.  as a result, her kidney function deteriorated rapidly.her creatinine bumped to 2.9 on day 3.  patient declinedhemodialysis, so she was made comfort measures only after allmedical options to keep her alive failed.  on the morning of herexpiration, her k was 5.4, and she was not producing urine.  shepassed at 1900 that day.  it is therefore very likely that shedied of hyperkalemia.  on telemetry, she went into brief vtfollowed by asystole minutes before her demise..# fall: etiology of fall was unclear. the most concerningpossibility was that patient's as led to syncope due tohypoperfusion. unfortunately, as the fall was unwitnessed andthe patient did not remember what happened this was impossibleto prove. patient underwent a repeat tte which showed criticalaortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).  therefore, it wascertainly very likely that as played a role in the fall..# humeral fracture: patient was seen by orthopedics in the ed.ortho decided to manage conservatively with sling and analgesia.pain control was achieved with tylenol around the clock,lidocaine patch, and low dose dilaudid with a goal to minimizeeffect on blood pressure.  patient's pain was well-controlled onthe above regimen..# rhythm: patient was in atrial fibrillation, and notanticoagulated. she was not on aspirin or coumadin because of aprevious gi bleed.  metoprolol was held given her hypotension.patient was observed on telemetry during her hospital stay inccu.  she went into vt followed by asystole minutes before sheexpired, likely secondary to hyperkalemia in the setting ofacute renal failure..# leukocytosis: unclear etiology, though rapid increase and lackof fevers, chills, or other acute changes suggested possiblyleukemoid reaction in the context of fracture and injury.cultures were negative, including blood cx, urine cx and c.diff. patient was not started on antibiotics since she had no sign ofinfection..# anemia: patient had history of normocytic anemia, baselinearound 29-20.  her hct was 43.6 on admission, likelyhemoconcentrated.  hct decreased to her baseline of 29 duringthe next two days.  she had no signs of active bleeding..# cad: patient reported history of cad, but with minimal detailsand there are no caths in our system. patient was not on asa orstatin (lipids normal). patient had some cardiac enzyme leaksduring her hospital stay, likely in the setting of hypotensionand decreased blood supply to coronaries..# ppx: patient was given subcutaneous heparin for dvtprophylaxis..# fen: patient was given cardiac healthy diet during thishospital stay..# code: dnr/dni (discussed with patient
