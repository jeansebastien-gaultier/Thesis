ofincreasing shortness of breath. the patient has had severeischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately20% , and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. he underwenta 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with a left internalmammary artery to the left anterior descending and saphenous veingrafts to the lvb , d1 and first obtuse marginal on 19 of october hispostoperative course was complicated by a sternal wound infection ,with debridement performed on 15 of may he was put on vancomycinand sent home 3 days prior to admission on intravenous vancomycin.he felt okay , until 1 or 2 days prior to admission when he hadincreased dyspnea on exertion and shortness of breath. he alsocomplained of increasing orthopnea and a mild cough accompanied byshaking chills the night prior to admission. he also complained ofmild upper and lower back pain. the patient denied dysuria. pastmedical history is as noted above. the patient has no known

needed ,vancomycin , 1.25 milligrams twice a day , axid , 150 milligrams twicea day , and kcl , 40 milligrams each day. social history revealedthe patient lives with his wife , he is an exposed smoker andoccasional ethanol drinker. he is retired secondary to hiscardiomyopathy. he was able to ambulate and play golf prior to thecoronary artery bypass grafting in october .physical examination: the patient was uncomfortable , tachypneic.vital signs were temperature 100.7 , heartrate 97 , blood pressure 108/67 , 96% oxygen saturation on 4 litersby nasal cannula. head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examinationshowed extraocular movements were intact , pupils equal , round ,reactive to light , oropharynx benign. neck was supple with nolymphadenopathy. chest showed left base bronchial breath soundswith egophony , with a few scattered wheezes throughout.cardiovascular examination showed jvp approximately 8 centimeters ,carotids were i+ bilaterally , no bruits , regular rate and rhythm ,s1 , s2 , very distant heart sounds. the liver edge was palpable.abdomen was nontender , positive bowel sounds. skin showed theupper chest wound where debridement had taken place , approximately6 centimeters long at the incisional site , which was slightlytender and erythematous. back showed no costovertebral angletenderness. extremities showed the patient had teds stockings on ,there was trace edema , ii+ pulses bilaterally. neurologicexamination showed the patient was alert and oriented , fluent , andthe examination was nonfocal.laboratory examination: on admission , sma-7 showed sodium 135 ,potassium 5.1 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate22 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 128. ck was 13 , triponin 0.0.prothrombin time was 14.1 , partial thromboplastin time 27.5.digoxin level was 0.6. complete blood count showed white bloodcount 7.8 , differential 69 neutrophils , 16 lymphs , 7 monos , 8eosinophils , hematocrit 28.7 , platelets 735 , 000. sputum from27 of january showed 4+ hemophilus influenza , which was pan sensitive.chest x-ray on the date of admission showed a left lower lobeinfiltrate with possible effusion. electrocardiogram showed leftbundle branch block. vq scan was low probability.hospital course: 1. infectious disease. the patient had amaximum temperature of 102.3 on 27 of february he wason vancomycin , gentamicin and ceftazidime. on 13 of june , gentamicinand ceftazidime were discontinued , and ofloxacin was startedsecondary to decreasing creatinine. after his temperature spike on21 of august , the patient's maximum temperature declined each of thefollowing days , and he has remained afebrile the last 2 days. thesternal wound appeared less erythematous , and he was continued onvancomycin for the coagulase negative staphylococcus that grew fromthe wound site on 15 of may the patient had a computerizedtomography scan of his chest to rule out an abscess at the sternalwound site and no abscess was seen. thoracentesis was done on theleft pleural effusion , and the tap was an exudate with ph 7.51 ,glucose 114 , total protein 4.9 , amylase 16 , ldh 38. there were 756white blood cells on differential , of which 93% macrophages and 7%mesothelioma cells , 127 , 000 red blood cells , and the fluid wasgrossly blood. cultures from the fluid were negative for bacteriaand fungal growth. gram stain showed no organisms , nopolymorphonuclear cells. vancomycin was redosed to 1 gram every 48hours secondary to increased creatinine and elevated levels. givenhis recent requirement for debridement , vancomycin will becontinued for 2 weeks after discharge. ofloxacin will also becontinued for the same. all cultures from this hospitalization arenegative to date.2. cardiovascular. the patient ruled out for myocardialinfarction. vq scan was low probability on admission. this wasperformed secondary to his baseline tachycardia. lower extremitynoninvasive studies and ultrasound were done and were negative fordeep vein thrombosis. the patient's triponin on admission was 0.0.the patient was aggressively diuresed as a component of his initialdyspnea on exertion was likely secondary to a degree of congestiveheart failure. his admission weight was 100.6 kilograms , andweight on discharge was 95.8 kilograms. with aggressive diuresisduring hospitalization , lasix was discontinued on the day prior todischarge. digoxin level on admission was 0.6 , on discharge was1.0. the patient had several episodes of hypotension with systolicblood pressure in the mid 70's to low 80's. captopril andlopressor were decreased and held at certain stages during hishospitalization. on discharge , he was on a stable dose ofcaptopril , 6.25 milligrams 3 times a day , and lopressor , 12.5milligrams twice a day. he was not orthostatic on the day prior todischarge.3. renal. the patient was aggressively diuresed. his bun andcreatinine rose from 12 and 1.2 on admission , to a peak of 36 and2.6 on 20 of november subsequently , the creatinine has declined , and on9 of july , bun was 37 , creatinine 2.2. the patient had aneosinophilia , which peaked at 18% on 16 of march , and subsequentlydecreased to 11% on discharge. urine eosinophils were not present.it appeared that his eosinophilia was related to ceftazidime , whichwas discontinued on 24 of january it is unlikely that his increasingrenal insufficiency is secondary to acute tubular necrosis. morelikely , it is secondary to the aggressive diuresis undertaken todecrease his congestive heart failure. follow-up laboratory valueswill likely reveal improvement in bun and creatinine status , aswell as a decrease in his peripheral eosinophilia.4. psychiatry. the patient has had anxiety , especially at night ,and has been treated successfully with ativan , but serax resultedin nightmares. the patient has a history of depression and maybenefit from counseling. the patient's decreased oral intake ,nightmares , and anxiety may all be related to an underlyingdepressive component over his prolonged illness.5. endocrine. the patient's blood sugar levels have been wellcontrolled on a regimen of nph , 20 each morning. he has notrequired any additional coverage , and regular insulin coverage hasbeen discontinued for 2 days.disposition: condition on discharge is fair. medications ondischarge are tylenol , 650 milligrams by mouth every4 hours as needed for headache , enteric-coated aspirin , 325milligrams by mouth each day , captopril , 6.25 milligrams by mouthevery 8 hours , held if systolic blood pressure is less than 85 ,digoxin , 0.125 milligrams by mouth each day , benadryl , 25 to 50milligrams by mouth every 4 hours as needed for itching , colace ,100 milligrams by mouth twice a day , nph insulin , 20 unitssubcutaneously each morning , atrovent inhaler , 2 puffs 4 times aday , ativan , 0.5 to 1 milligram by mouth every 6 hours as neededfor anxiety and insomnia , lopressor , 12.5 milligrams by mouth twicea day , held for systolic blood pressure less than 80 or heart rateless than 60 , niferex , 150 milligrams by mouth twice a day ,percocet , 1 or 2 tablets by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain ,sarna lotion topically to back as needed , vancomycin , 1 gramintravenously every 48 hours times 10 days , axid , 150 milligrams bymouth twice a day , ofloxacin , 200 milligrams by mouth twice a
