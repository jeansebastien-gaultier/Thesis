was transitioned to 40mg po daily. daily weights and i/o'swere followed. his blood pressure was controlled as below; inparticular, he was started on beta blocker, resumed on an acei(which he apparently did not fill at his pharmacy), and startedon spironolactone as well. his o2 requirement was weaned off..# hypoalbuminemia: possibly renal or primary gi. nothing onhistory to suggest primary gi protein losing enteropathy thoughthis should be considered (i.e. celiac sprue, lymphoma, ibd,amyloid etc.) especially in light of improving renal functionwhich argues against primary renal protein loss, low albumin,absence of known liver disease and weight loss. spep/upepnegative. anti-ttg iga negative. pt should discuss need forcolonoscopy with his pcp given anemia, weight loss and age..# gram

nothing on history/exam to suggest primary rheumatologicdisorder, esr 13, [doctor first name ] negative. he was scheduled for a lymphnode biopsy (his r inguinal lymph node seemed the largest),excisional by surgery. however, he refused this. contact[name (ni) ] legalguardian [name (ni) ] [last name (namepattern1) ] as well as pcp regarding this issue. ptinitially stated he did not have enlarged lymph nodes. however,later on he stated that he knew the reason to biopsy the lymphnodes was to look for "cancer" and then stated that he wouldnever have a biospy. discussed this with patient's pcp and legalguardian who did not want to force (by physical or chemicalrestraint) the patient to undergo a procedure against his will.discussed possibility of biopsy with the patient multiple timesand he did decline, but agrees to follow up with his pcp forfurther evaluation..# acute renal failure w/ proteinuria: lack of schistocytes oninitial smear argued against ttp etiology. likely pre-renal,perhaps due to poor po intake. unclear if he was hypotensive inthe ed. fena suggested prerenal etiology. creatinine improved tobaseline. he should have chemistries/electrolytes followed afterdischarge. creatinine on discharge 1.6..# altered mental status, from opiates received in the ed nowresolved. he was initially admitted to the icu given hisunresponsiveness after opiates. this resolved after being givennarcan and never reoccurred..# anemia - his b12, folate, and iron were normal. smear waschecked in icu and only rare schistocytes were seen. hiv ab wasnegative. his hematocrit was stable on monitoring and was 30.1on day of discharge without evidence of bleeding. this is likelydue ckd. however, given recent abdominal pain and anemia ptshould undergo a colonoscopy..# thrombocytopenia - he was found to have thrombocytopenia,thought to be subacute, given that he had 130k one month ago.his platelets were monitored and normalized. splenomegaly notnoted on imaging. hiv negative. could have been due tomedications or acute illness..# ascites - new finding. had not been tapped b/c icu felt nottappable. no known chronic liver disease or

notradiographically/clinically have. ruq us was without significantascites, not enough to tap; no cirrhosis noted. this could bedue to heart failure, but is likely due to low albumin.quantiferon gold pending at time of discharge..# hypertension - he was continued on his home regimen, althoughit was found that he wasn't filling these prescriptions as anoutpt. given proteinuria, he was (re-)started on an ace-i. hewas also started on spironolactone given his heart failure andhypertension (after drawing renin and aldosterone). he wasstarted on beta blocker given dchf.- with chronic hypokalemia, sent renin / aldosterone levelssince these have never been sent, to rule outhyperaldonsteronism. these are still pending at time ofdischarge..# hypokalemia- see above, concern for hyperaldo. repleted dialy.pt started on spironolactone and still required supplementationof potassium. suggested to decrease home potassium regimen by[2-8] given ckd and use of spironolactone. pt should have hispotassium checked regularly..# lymphadenopathy - bilateral inguinal and axillary. he deniedfevers and chills, but noted weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, ahndelevated ldh,  suggested biopsy to r/o tb, lymphoma (with flowcytommetry), etc.  surgery prepared for excisional biopsy of ln,but pt refused. pt refused on multiple occasions. see above. pcpand legal guardian did not want to for pt to undergo proceduresand testing that he did not want. pt was aware that biopsy wassuggested to r/o cancer..# positive ppd (untreated) - cxr was performed without note oftuberculous disease inh is

larger), otherrheum disorders (unlikely by hx/exam). this was likely due tohypoalbumenemia..# long qt: present also on ekg [2178-5-8]. his potassium wasrepleted. qtc remained ~440 with haldol dosing. serial ekg wereperformed. pt's haldol dose was decreased to 5mg from 10mg dueto this. ekg's should be monitored in outpatient setting..# lacunar infarct, clincally quiescent: seen on head ct, and
