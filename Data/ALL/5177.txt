record date: 2085-07-25edvisit^51639357^noonan, france^07/25/85^elrod, ryleythis patient was seen with dr. ussery.  i confirm that i haveinterviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident'sdocumentation on the patient's chart, and discussed theevaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.history of present illness:  this is a 73-year-old male with ahistory of cough and pleuritic type chest pain.  the patientdenies any nausea or vomiting.  he does have history of mi aswell as multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease.  healso reports lower extremities swelling worse than usual, and hasleft greater than right edema at baseline due to a reconstructivesurgery following motor vehicle collision.  of note, thepatient's medications include coumadin, which he is on for atrialfibrillation.physical examination:  the patient is awake, alert, and in nodistress.  his vital signs show heart rate of 70, respiratoryrate of 24, blood pressure 112/72, and oxygen saturation 96% onroom air and 98% on 2 liters.  his lungs are clear and heart isirregularly irregular.  this is somewhat limited due to bodyhabitus.  the abdomen is soft and there is a chronic left upperquadrant tenderness.  the back shows left cva tenderness.laboratory data:  the laboratory analysis shows a hematocrit of42.1 and a white blood cell count of 7.6.  cardiac biomarkers arenegative, and the troponin is less than 0.1.  a d-dimer is lessthan 200.  the inr is 1.7.  ua is pending.  ecg shows an atrialfibrillation with some nonspecific t-wave changes in leads v3through v6.imaging studies:  a chest radiograph was a markedly limited dueto patient's habitus.decision making and emergency department course:  there was noclear etiology to the patient's shortness of breath.  given hisanticoagulation and a negative d-dimer, we feel that this isunlikely to be pe.  it is clearly possible to be cardiac, giventhe history of coronary artery disease and a slightly abnormalelectrocardiogram.  this may be pneumonia, and the chest x-ray isnot terribly helpful.  we are obtaining a ct scan of the chestwithout iv contrast to better delineate the pulmonaryarchitecture, and are admitting the patient to the medicineservice for monitoring and cycling of enzymes and ecgs.diagnoses:1.  shortness of breath.2.  t-wave inversions on electrocardiogram.______________________________elrod, ryley m.d.d: 07/25/85t: 07/25/85dictated by: elrod, ryleyescription document:5-9812947 bffocus  not reviewed by attending physician
