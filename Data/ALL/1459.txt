[known lastname ] is a 75 year old woman with a history of afib s/pablation,htn,dm, spinal stenosis, with recent hospitalizationfor osteomyelitis who presents with altered mental status andworsening tremor.  she had been discharged from [hospital1 ] followinghospitalization from presumed sepsis and hypotension on [2125-11-5]to rehab. on the evening of [11-9] a moonlighter was called forincreasing agitation. it is unclear at what point she  received0.5mg of ativan. the patient was confused (oriented x1) with  aquestion of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech andwas transferred to [hospital1 ] for concern of seizures v. sepsis withams..in ed tachy to 110s, sbp 110s and required a  0.7l fluid boluswith resolution of bp to 130s, but remained tachy to low 100s. act ab/pelvis revealed a fluid collection on her left flank. nope was noted. she continued to receive vanc/flagyl and got adose of zosyn, with admission for further work up..ros was negative for chest pain, syncope or presyncope,myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or redstools. patient did not have any other complaints. she reportedthat her tremor has been present since she was in her 20s,related to a medication effect..this am on the floor she was intermittently oriented to placeand month but sometimes thinking she was stranded without hercar and needing help.  she did complain of anxiety once, callingfor help, and was verbally calmed down then noted to betachycardic to the 140s. cardiology was consulted, with carotidmassage x 2 performed, with return to normal sinus rythm.[name (ni) ] son notes that her speech is significantly moregarbled in the last two to three days than previously. she beganto have difficulty speaking status post extubation during theprevious icu stay, but her speech has become progressivelyworse. he confirms that the patient has had a baseline tremor,thought to be due to a medication effect 20 years ago. by thetime the son visited the patient in the late morning, her tremorhad improved, though it did intermittently worsen when thepatient became more anxious.  son also noted that pt hadintermittently stared off into space and been less responsivefor a few minutes, then would return to conversation.past medical history:past medical history:atrial fibrillation s/p ablation, not on coumadiniron-deficiency anemiagastritis per egd, [2124]insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus c/b neuropathy, retinopathylumbar stenosis, s/p l5-s1 laminectomy (age 40)hypertensionhyperlipidemiadjdtremorsteatohepatitisdepressionpast surgical history:cataract surgerycarpal tunnel release bilaterallytonsillectomyappendectomycholecystectomysocial history:patient currently lives in a house in [location (un) ], mass.  she liveswith her husband.  she is now retired but formerly worked inmedical records at [hospital ] hospital.  she denies etoh, tobacco,and other drugs.  mrs.

s/p ablation, htn, dm,spinal stenosis, with recent hospitalization for osteomyelitiswho presents with altered mental status and worsening tremor.she had been discharged from [hospital1 ] following hospitalization frompresumed sepsis and hypotension on [2125-11-5] to rehab. on theevening of [11-9] a moonlighter was called for increasingagitation. it is unclear at what point she received 0.5mg ofativan. the patient was confused (oriented x1) with a questionof increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and wastransferred to [hospital1 ] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with ams. onthe day of admission, patient was transferred to the micu for anepisode of unresponsiveness on the floor. the patient rapidlyimproved in regards to her mental status upon admission to themicu. ct head and mri were negative, and neuro felt this eventwas likely toxic/metabolic in nature. she was called out to thefloor where an eeg was performed and negative. she underwentdiagnosistc thoracentesis which was transudative in nature on[11-12]. post-thoracentesis cxr detected a left hemidiaphagm andrepeat film several hours later was performed while the patientwas having another episode of shaking. she became unresponsiveand was noted to have shallow breathing. the xray technicians atthe patient's side were unable to palpate a pulse so cpr wasinitiated and a code was called. code team immediately notedthat patient was in a fib, and cpr was stopped. patient at thistime was awake but delirious. her oxygen saturation began toplummet and decreased breath sounds were noted on the left side.cxr revealed a large hydrothorax, and patient was transferredback to the micu. a chest tube was placed and blood tingedsanguinous fluid returned. patient was intubated for airwayprotection.patient remained in the micu from [11-12] through [11-18]. while inthe micu she was extubated on [11-14]. she required pressors from[11-12] through [11-15]. her hypotension was felt to be due tohypovolemia secondary to dramatic chest tube fluid output. chesttube drained between 2 and 4 l per day of ascitic fluid frompresumed hepatic hydrothorax. cardiac enzymes were slightlyelevated, but consistent with her level of renal dysfunction andwas felt not to have acs. she had several ttes which showedimproving systolic function from ef 35 to 50%.  the patientrequired 2 untis of prbc transfusion in the unit and multiplealbumin bags for resuscitation. thoracic surgery was consultedon [11-16] for assistance on hydrothorax management, and theyadvised no surgical intervention. instead the chest tube wasplaced to waterseal on [11-17] and diuresis was initiated withlasix drip per thoracic surgery recommendations. a diaphragmaticdefect was not felt to be responsible. the patient was able tomaintain her pressures, and she tolerated diuresis with thesemaneuvers. her course in the micu was also complicated byintermittent episodes of sinus tachycardia to has high as 140sbpm which responded transiently to carotid massage. her sinustach was felt to be due to [last name (un) 3041] shifts and anxiety. she wastransferred out of the micu on [11-18]. no clear cause for herchange in mental status was found while in the micu. a repeateeg was again negative, and neurology once again felt that thiswas likely multifactorial toxic/metabolic insults in the settingof acute on chronic renal failure, liver disease, chf, dm andhypoxia from chronic pleural effusions.back on the medical floor, she continued to improve.# altered mental status: her altered mental status was likelyrelated to medication side effects or hepatic encephalopathy.her elavil was decreased for possible anticholinergic sideeffects.  if her mental status worsens, suggest changing patientover to nortripytline and checking levels.# tachycardia: her sinus tachycardia improved after addingmetoprolol back to her medication regimen.# anemia: she had a hematocrit drop while in the micu withoutclear source and was guaiac negative. after 2 units prbcs on[11-15], her hematocrit was stable.# osteomyelitis: patient is on long term vanco/metronidazolesince previous hospitalization for l2 osteo and is followed byid as an outpatient. she is to continue vancomycin until [2125-12-16]and flagyl until [2125-12-20].# mild systolic congestive heart failure: she was diuresed asabove. patient's most recent ef 50%.# nash cirrhosis: she was seen by hepatology during thisadmission.  she had a low meld.  patient was started onaldactone and diuresed as above.  she is to follow-up with theliver center as an outpatient.# inverted nipple noted on exam: patient will need follow upwith pcp for this issue.# dm: she was continued on an insulin sliding scale.# communication: daughter [name (ni) ] [telephone/fax (1) 40153],
