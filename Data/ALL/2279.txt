coronaryartery disease; hypertension; atrial fibrillation; diabetes type2; end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis; history of urinarytract infections; and benign prostatic hypertrophy.operations and procedures: no operations or procedures weredone.treatments: no treatments were done.review of systems: in addition to what is noted below , he doesnote increased fatigue. no fevers , chills , or night sweats. nopalpitations. no diaphoresis. no abdominal pain. occasionaldiarrhea with loss of bowel control. no nausea or vomiting. nodysuria. no hematuria. no bright red blood per rectum.chief complaint: shortness of breath and failure to thrive.brief hospital course: this is a 73-year-old gentleman withend-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis , with ischemiccardiomyopathy with an ef of 15% who was treated for c. difficilecolitis and worsening chf. the patient has a long history ofesrd secondary to hypertension and diabetes. he beganhemodialysis in march 2005. he also has a long history ofperipheral vascular disease status post right carotidendarterectomy and bilateral external iliac angioplasty as wellas atrial fibrillation and a history of cva diagnosed by mri withthe timing unknown , thought to be secondary to thrombi from hisatrial fibrillation. this gentleman presented with worseningshortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion as well as worseningdysphagia and anorexia on march , 2005. apparently , he was ingood health or at least his usual state of health until may ,2005 , when he was admitted to aton norran rehabilitation hospital of for gusymptoms which are unclear and a loss of appetite. he stayedthere for 30 days and then transferred to a rehabilitationcenter. after being discharged there for 1 week , he developedworsening shortness of breath and was unable to answer the doorwhen his neighbor knocked. the neighbor brought him into the edon march , 2005 , for acute shortness of breath , which thepatient described , has worsened over the past 3 to 4 days. hehas gone from being able to walk across his apartment to now onlybeing able to take 3 to 4 steps before becoming progressivelyshort of breath , and he now sleeps on three pillows. in fact , hecurrently cannot even get through his hpi without 3- to 5-worddyspnea. he denies any pnd. concerning for his dysphagia , hefeels like he first lost weight when he was trying to control hisvolume status prior to hemodialysis initiation in early march2005. his goal was to be 114 pounds and he limited his intake inorder to maintain that weight instead of limiting his volume.about 2 months ago , he began losing his appetite. he states thatthis was because of the "his renal diet." it was unclear if thediet caused this loss of appetite or his loss of appetite wasprior to the diet. over the past 3 weeks , he has notedprogressive difficulty in swallowing solid foods. he is able toswallow liquids. since discharge from rehabilitation a weekprior to admission , he is only able to take liquids. he quoteshe cannot even take noodles and soup. he has no nausea orvomiting unless attempting to swallow solids and no abdominalpain. his throat is sore and dry. he constantly wants water andice. also concerning is the report , it is unclear , about a 20-to 40-pound weight loss over the past 2 to 3 months. in the ed ,he was afebrile; heart rate 105; blood pressure 136/70;respirations 18; and 97% on room air. he was given lopressor forrate control for his atrial fibrillation. his ekg showed new twave inversions in the inferolateral leads and q waves , whichwere new for his baseline in the inferior leads. there was alsoan s1 , q3 , t3 , which was new but absent once his rate wascontrolled.the patient was admitted to the floor and briefly transferred tothe unit for refractory hypertension , though he was found to haveright subclavian stenosis and blood pressure was checked in theleft arm. his blood pressure was fine at 100 to 110 systolic.he was then transferred back to the floor. an abdominal ct wasdone on july , 2005 , which showed marked edematous colonicwall beginning on the ascending colon all the way through to therectum. the differential diagnosis at this time waspseudomembranous colitis versus ischemic bowel. his lactatelevel was normal. he had a benign examination , and because ofthe distribution and the past antibiotic use , it was felt that hemost likely had c. difficile , which was found to be culturepositive on november , 2005. he had an echocardiogram , whichrevealed an ef of 10% to 15% with global hypokinesis and akinesisas compared to an echocardiogram done at the outside hospital inmarch 2005 with an ef of 30% to 35%. he had severe tr. on august , 2005 , while on hemodialysis , he had an episode of substernalchest pain. enzymes were sent and troponin peaked at 18. an ekgshowed st depressions in v2 through v6 , which resolved with ratecontrol. he received aspirin and heparin and continued hislopressor and statin. the decision was made not to catheterize ,as he was a poor candidate likely to have three-vessel diseaseand not a surgical candidate. the patient made the decision withthe cardiologist , family , and the team. the patient wasscheduled for an egd and colonscopy to evaluate his dysphagia andcolitis , but this was deferred secondary to the incident of thenon-st-elevation mi on march , 2005. subsequently , the patientwas managed medically for his worsening chf and shortness ofbreath with fluid removal at hemodialysis on tuesdays , thursdays ,and saturdays. the patient began flagyl p.o. 500 mg t.i.d. onmarch , 2005 , which should be continued through november ,2005 , for a full 14-day course.impression: this is a 73-year-old man with acute worseningshortness of breath in the setting of a 20-plus-pound weightloss , increasing dysphagia , and progressive fatigue for the past2 months. he was found to have clostridium difficile colitis andischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%. hiscourse was complicated by non-st-elevation myocardial infarctionon march , 2005 , with a troponin peak of 18 , which was likelydemand ischemia from tachycardia in the congestive heart failuresetting. his egd and colonscopy was postponed secondary to thenon-st-elevation myocardial infarction. the patient was managedmedically with fluid removal with hemodialysis for congestiveheart failure. he continues flagyl p.o. for clostridiumdifficile treatment. he was transferred on august , 2005 , to arehabilitation facility.problems by systems:1. gastrointestinal: we are treating his c. difficile colitiswith p.o. flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. from march , 2005 , throughaugust , 2005. his stool did grow out staphylococcus aureus ,but this was likely from colonization from his mouth flora , andtherefore , we are not treating. per id consult , we are holdingall other antibiotics and treating only when cultures arepositive. he had a planned egd and colonscopy , which waspostponed due to the nstemi on march , 2005. he should have ascope done , both upper and lower , 2 to 3 months down the roadonce the patient is stable. his lfts were noted to bump onaugust , 2005 , but now are trending down; that is likelysecondary to either shock liver or just his nstemi. continue tomonitor them at rehabilitation. the patient is unable to swallowsolids and is currently on a full liquid diet. after egd ,consider barium swallow if nondiagnostic. the patient refuses ngtube , so encourage p.o. intake. he will take nepro if asked. heshould have at least 100 cc of nepro a day.2. cardiovascular: chf with an ef of 10% to 15% with globalhypokinesis compared to march 2005 ef of 30% to 35%. he hassevere mr and tr. he is on lopressor 12.5 t.i.d. and captopril12.5 t.i.d. with blood pressure tolerating well. he was startedon digoxin 0.25 three days a week on sunday , wednesday , andfriday , and his current digoxin level is 0.9 on august , 2005.he was wet on examination routinely and so it was taken offbetween 1 to 3 liters at hemodialysis regularly. he had annstemi on march , 2005 , with troponin peak of 18 , likely demandischemia from chf. continue aspirin , beta-blocker , and statin.we discontinued the heparin after 24 hours. a decision was madenot to catheterize , as he is a poor candidate likely to havethree-vessel disease. ekg currently shows q waves inferiorlywith st depressions in v3 through v4 and t wave inversions in v3through v6. the depressions improved with rate control. he doeshave a low blood pressure in the right upper extremity , which isfalse due to a right subclavian stenosis; always check bloodpressures in the left arm. he has atrial fibrillation and heused to be on diltiazem for rate control. he was on lopressorwith good effect. he was restarted on his coumadin dose at 4 mgq.h.s. on august , 2005 , for anticoagulation. he is ontelemetry. he should be monitored of his inr for a goal inr of 2to 3 for his atrial fibrillation and change of coumadin asaccordingly.3. endocrine: now on half-strength novolog sliding scale. hehas had trouble with hyperglycemia for the past several days.his fingersticks can go up to 250. we think this is okay not tocover , as when we choose to cover him , he dips down into the 40s.4. pulmonary: on admission , he had acute shortness of breathand tachycardia. an ekg showed s1 , q3 , t3. pe ct was negative.there was no parenchymal disease. some hilar lymph nodes werenoted. his repeated chest x-rays were every other day , whichonly showed changes in the chf status. there was routinely noconsolidation or interstitial disease seen. his last chest x-rayshowed bilateral pulmonary edema and that was on august , 2005.5. infectious disease: we are only doing flagyl p.o. for c.difficile treatment. he should continue 500 mg t.i.d. p.o.through november , 2005 , holding all other antibiotics. wequestioned if he is septic when his temperatures drop to 95 to96 , but all blood , sputum , and urine cultures have been no growthto date. you could consider a third generation cephalosporin ifa pneumonia develops.6. renal: hemodialysis on saturday , tuesday , and thursday.7. hematology: he has anemia. panel workup with mixed pictureof iron and chronic anemia. we are repleting his iron withvitamin c. he received 1 unit on march , 2005 , athemodialysis. his current hematocrit is 31. guaiac stools havebeen negative.8. he has a malignancy workup , which has been negative so far.he has a normal tsh , psa , and free psa. no mass is seen onabdominal ct or chest ct.9. prophylaxis: he is on heparin subcutaneously and nexium.10. disposition: he is going to rehabilitation today on february , 2005.11. code status: dnr/dni.12. health care proxy: his brother , son gonzaliz ,383-088-5204.plan to do:1. hemodialysis on tuesdays , thursdays , and saturdays.2. continue flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. from march , 2005 , tonovember , 2005.3. follow inr for goal of 2 to 3 for atrial fibrillation , oncoumadin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. currently.discharge medications: tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.headache;
