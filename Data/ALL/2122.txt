[known lastname 16368] is a 28-year-old man with a history of biclonalleukemia, diagnosed in [2169-12-20] status post chemo initiallyand then after a relapse of his all, he underwent allo bmttransplant on [2170-5-3], but his all relapsed in [2171-7-21]and was treated with vincristine, prednisone, and gleevec. thegleevec was discontinued because of a reaction to it. mostrecently he has received clofarabine after which he had anaplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost. his mostrecent hospitalization was [10-23] until [2172-3-26] during which hewas noted to have pulmonary nodules, and was treated empiricallywith ambisome, voriconazole, and initially capsofungin and wassent home on ambisome and voriconazole. last dose of ambisomewas [3-31], and he was continued on voriconazole alone with hislast dose on [4-16] because the the medication.he was last seen in dr. [last name (stitle) ]??????s clinic on [2172-4-16] and had beendoing well. he had a bone marrow biopsy performed on that day aswell. the bone marrow biopsy is pending at this time.the patient presented to the ed on [4-19] at 04:30 complaining ofchest and neck pain. the patient states that he was in his usualstate of good health until last night when he had gradual onsetleft neck to substernal chest pain described as "somethingsqueezing in from my lungs," "pressure," 15/10 and pleurtic. healso complains of neck pain which is worse with movement. noassociated sob or diaphoresis. has had mild nausea since hisdischarge without emesis. patient denies f/c, cough, abdominalpain, rash. this pain is similar to pulmonary nodule pain he hashad in the past.in the ed, his initial vs were 99.2, hr 121 bp 126/78 rr 16 100%on ra. he was given morphine 8 mg iv and dilaudid 8mg iv forpain control and became hypotensive with vs 116, 78/44 while inthe ed. he recieved 6 l ns with only 500 cc of dark urine outputover several hours and was then started on levophed for pressuresupport. seen by cardiology consult who felt not consistent withcardiogenic shock. he was admitted to the micu for further workup and management.past medical history:1. biclonal leukemia:-diagnosed [12-23] -- presenting with sore throat, severe upperairway inflammation requiring intubation, and a wbc of 130,000.examination of the marrow demonstrated nearly 100%blasts, andcytogenetic examination showed t9;22 and q341.-q11.2. he wasinitially treated with emergent pheresis, steroids, andhydroxyurea, then was started on regimens to address both alland the aml component. he underwent hypercvad regimen withoutcomplete remission.-[4-21] -- pt had matched unrelated donor allo-bmt with precedingtotal body radiation and cytoxan conditioning regimen. followingthis, he exeperienced grade 1 gvhd with rash, treated withsteroid taper. he had a transaminitis at the time, but bxexcluded hepatic gvhd involvement.-[date range (1) 46485] -- marrow bx indicated remission-[7-23] -- pt developed petechiae, wbc found to be 18.4, plateletsof 19, 18%blasts, and a marrow bx indicated all recurrence. hewas treated with vincristine and prednisone.-[2171-8-29] -- a repeat marrow bx indicated residual leukemia,though improved from previous.-[2171-9-4] -- pt underwent donor lymphocyte infusion-[2171-10-14] -- marrow biopsy shows leukemia with 80% involvement,and pt is admitted for hypercvad, discharged [10-17].-[10-23]- received clofarabine after which he had anaplastic-looking marrow and received a stem cell boost.2. prolonged febrile neutropenia complicated by severeinfections including probable fungal infection with pulmonarynodules and mesenteric mass.3. transaminitis -- liver bx with focal

evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.3) stable small to moderate pericardial effusion.4) decreased size of mesenteric mass, which is now notmeasurable, with minimal residual haziness in the mesentery.[2172-4-21] 05:50am blood wbc-3.3# rbc-3.18 hgb-10.2 hct-28.6mcv-90 mch-32.1 mchc-35.7 rdw-18.3 plt ct-118[2172-4-20] 05:05am blood wbc-8.2 rbc-3.91# hgb-12.1# hct-34.4#mcv-88 mch-31.0

narcoticsrelated vs. cardiogenic vs adrenal insufficiency. he requiredlevophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain sbp>100 andwas started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenalinsufficiency. pt had flat jvp and warm extremities, no evidenceof tamponade. he was ruled out for mi by enzymes, and cardiologyconsult did not not think picture was c/w cardiogenic shock. acortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, sowe discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone. sepsis wasconsidered and he was broadly covered on admission withambisome, imipenem, voriconazole. he was weaned off vasopressorsand ivf on hd3 and sbp's remained in the 90's but he wasasymptomatic, making urine, and had normal lactate so no furtherintervention was made..#id:a) pulmonary nodules:pt had history of pulmonary nodules thought to be of fungalorigin without positive cultures data. he had been on empirictreatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3months, then voriconazole alone since [4-1], but was off this forfour days before admission. chest ct revealed no nodularinfection but a rll infiltrate concerning for cap and on hd2 wasstarted on levofloxacin. at that same time he was started onvancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had apermanent tunneled line. he developed periorbital edema anddiffuse skin etyhema, elevated lft's and eosinophilia thoughtinitially due to vancomycin so this was stopped. vancomycin waschanged to daptomycin which was stopped [4-21] given blood culturesremained negative x 48 hours. infectious workup in looking forsource of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture,fungal , afb, pcp, [name10 (nameis) 14616], mycoplasma, [name10 (nameis) 14616] urine ag,galatomannan all of which were negative. pt's lft's continued torise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed toazithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of. he was thenstarted on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence offungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for gvhd asbelow.elevated lft's-pt continued to have climbing lft with acholestatic picture initially thought to be due to drug reactionby both id and dermatology. skin biopsy showed completeseparation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash.alkaline phosphatase continued to rise despite rash improving sothen arose concern for gvhd as had occured in the past. at thispoint he was started on cyclosporine dosed to trough >100 and aday later mycofenolate was added. liver team was consulted andfelt this was most likely gvhd and got a liver biopsy. biopsyrevealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with gvhdalthough it was unclear if this was old or new. he was continuedon immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [5-3] was feelingwell so plan was made for further workup and treatment ofelevated lft's as an outpt..#chest/neck pain: t wave changes on ekg were non-diagnostic. itdidn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out formi with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry. ctashowed no pe/aortic dissection. most likely cause of pain ispleuritic chest pain from pneumonia. he was treated with hisoutpatient dose of oxycontin in hospital which he responded wellto..#anemia: baseline hct was around 28 thought to be anemia ofchronic diseae.hemolysis labs were negativemedications on
