[known lastname 3234] is a 36 year old gentleman with a pmh signifciantwith dilated cardiomyopathy s/p aicd, pe not on anticoagulation,asthma, and htn admitted to an osh with dyspnea now thetransferred to [hospital1 18] micu after pea arrest x2.# pea arrest and subsequent anoxic brain injury.: suspect thatoriginal osh pea arrest due to hypoxemia or acidosis, with [hospital1 18]ed pea arrest due to acidosis with admission ph 7.16 on arrival. tte with evidence of rv failure to suggest pe. lvef 30% withknown dilated cardiomyopathy. he was cooled per protocol.initially, his eeg was concerning without evident brainactivity. on hospital day 3, there was only comatose activityand his prognosis was guarded. however, the patient was able tobe weaned off the vent and over the course of the next threedays his mental status improved.  he was alert, oriented toplace and day of the week and moving all 4 extremities.  hebecame more interactive on transfer to the floor, was initiallyspeaking in spanish and english and not always making sense butthen started responding more appropiately and followingcommands.  on hospital day 11 he had a witnessed grand malseizure and was given ativan and started on keppra withneurology consult.  his mental status was worse for 24 hoursafter the seizure but then he slowly returned to his recentbaseline.  he was somewhat aggitated so his keppra was switchedto topiramate. he had a subsequent seizure on [3-18] with luetonic clonic activity and impaired consciousness but thisresolved spontaneously after 1-2 minutes. he was contineud ontopamax per neuro recommendations. ot and pt were consulted andworked with the patient as he will likely require a longrehabilitation course.  at the time of discharge the patient wasalert, oriented (though not always to date), following commandsbut impulsive with poor motor planning leading to several falls. neurology notes indicate the patient has the potentialtoimprove from a neurologic standpoint. he also may haverecurrent seizures which should be treated with ativan iv or imand do not neccessarily indicate patient needs to return tohospital unless they continue for greater than 5 minutes or hehas multiple recurrent seizures or complications such asaspiration.-patient will be on topiramate 25mg po bid until [3-22] pm thenincrease to 50mg po bid for seven days then increase to 75mg [hospital1 ]ongoing.-patient will follow up with dr.

[name2 (ni) 227] multiple cardiac arrests,also a concern for development of ards.  the patient wasinitially treated broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl,cipro, and oseltamavir. he was treated with iv soludemedrol andalbuterol mdi. he was ventialted according to ards-net protocol.on admission, he had two chest tubes placed for pneumothoraces.they were removed on hospital day 1. in his first several days,his respiratory status was comprimised by lobar collapse, firstof the rul and then of the rml. his extubation was initiallylimited both by agitation requiring sedation and by requirementsfor high peep to maintain oxygenation. his oxygenation wasimproved with diuresis and agitation was better controlled withseroquel. he was extubated on [3-1] and respiratory status wasstable.  his asthma was treated with standing and prn albuteroland ipratriopium and a slow prednisone taper which he lcompleted on [2115-3-18] and he was restarted on advair-patient may require additional nebs on top of his standingadvair though his respiratory status has been very stable,without wheezing for the last week.- would like benefit from outpatient pfts and is scheduled tosee a pulmonologist in follow up..# ventilator associated pneumonia:  patient developed a fever on[2-27] with new infiltrates on chest xray while intubated. he wasinitially covered with vanc/cefepime and cipro. cipro waseventually discontinued. he did not grow any organisms otherthan yeast in his sputum. he completed an 8 day course ofvanco/cefepime..# myoclonus: when mental status improved, was noted to havemyoclonic jerks. per neurology, likely [first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (namepattern1) 1683] syndromewhich is anoxic injury to the purkinje cells.  these jerkscontinued for about one week and then became rare..# dilated [last name (lf) 89982], [first name3 (lf) ] 30%. s/p icd.  patient wasdiuresed with iv lasix in the ed and then transitioned to polasix, home dose, on the floor.  his respiratory status remainedstable. also continued on home dose of carvedilol and lisinoprilbut ace downtitrated from 40 to 20 when had elevated cr 1.9 on[3-18] and slightly low bps high 90s/60s. bp improved to 100s/60s..#hypertension: patient's home regimen was continued on thefloor, but his sbp dipped into the high 80s and low 90s solisinopril was decreased to 20mg po daily and his sbp remained100-130..# l1 compression fracture: after the patient fell, he wascomplaining of low back pain so a l-spine xray was performed andshowed l1 compressin fracture with no cord impingement onimaging.  the patient had no localizing deficits on serial neuroexam.  he was treated with pain medication including low doseultram, standing tylenol and a lidocaine patch.  calcitonin wastried for pain with compression fracture but this did not seemto help with symptoms so was discontinued..# leukocytosis: wbc >20  persistently in the micu even afterbeing treated for infection.  since no new infection was foundthis was presumed [12-26] steroids and the leukocytosis improvedwith prednisone taper.  wbc 12 on day of discharge.# hyperglycemia: patient is not known to be a diabetic and wasfelt [12-26] steroids,  his sugars were controlled on sliding scaleinsulin in the hospital but he no longer had insulinrequirements as his prednisone was tapered..#.
