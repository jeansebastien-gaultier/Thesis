was admitted with abdominal pain that was similar innature to prior episodes of hereditary angioedema flare. she was treatedwith ffp x 2units on admission with benadryl premedication. she diddevelop a few facial hives without any respiratory distress by the end ofthe second unit of ffp. this resolved after ffp infusion stopped and shewas given additional benadryl. she tolerated benadryl well , yet had asensation of restlessness afterwards. on 4/4 she got another 2 units ffpwith premedication of benadyrl 25 iv prior to each bag as well as ativan0.5 mg po prior to transfusions. this was a good combination as she didnot get hives , nor the anxiety that accompanies benadryl. by 8/21 , herabdominal distension had improved markedly and her pain had largelysubsided. given the fact that prior episodes have taken a few days forcomplete resolution of distension , she was discharged with instructions tocontact her immunologist should symptoms worsen or persist.she will be discharged on a
