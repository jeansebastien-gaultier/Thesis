complaint:diarrhea for 6 weeks, anuric x3 days.major surgical or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:pt's history and hospital course reviewed. briefly, this is a52m w/ h/o hiv who p/w 3 days of anuria and general malaise. hehad been having diarrhea for the past 6 weeks and onpresentation to the ed for his anuria, he was found to behypotensive to 84/60 and in arf with cr 5.7 (baseline 1.0). healso complained of left-sided chest discomfort, a substernalpressure radiating across his chest that had been ongoing for2-3 weeks. sepsis protocol was initiated and rsc cvl was placed.bp improved to sbp of 100 with 4l ivf and iv heparin was startedfor troponin leak of 0.11. he was transferred to the micu..while in the micu, the patient's arf responded well to ivf, withhis cr decreasing to 1.8 on transfer to the floor. tnt decreasedfrom 0.11 to 0.02. however, tte showed a markedly dilated rvcavity and moderate global rv free wall hypokinesis consistentwith rv pressure/volume overload. the patient's pretestprobability for pe was considered high given his hiv status,chest pain, and tte results, but a v/q scan showed lowprobability. given his post-test estimated probability of pe was20%, he was continued on anticoagulation. hct drop from 33.8 onadmission to 26.1 after fluid resuscitation with guaiac positivestool, hypovolemia, likely demand ischemia, and h/o abnormal egdraised strong suspicion for gib, but his hct returned to 33.3 bytime of transfer to floor. his platelets dropped from 160 onadmission to 97, and hit antibody test was positive [9-25], so hewas switched to argatroban. on the day of transfer, the ptspiked a low-grade temperature to 100.7. he was pan-cultured butno antibiotics were started as there was no clear

initially admitted to the micu for hypotension and arf,improved after volume resuscitation..# diarrhea. likely the patient was hypotensive and in renalfailure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating arf. the patienthad a small amount of outpatient work-up for this, negative todate, including: stool c. diff, culture and cmv viral loadundetectable. the patient was given symptomatic treatment,including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically. he wasunable to provide a stool sample while on the floor. the patientwas given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample forrepeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial), dfa forcrytosporidium and giardia, ova & parasites, microsporidium. thegi team was consulted on  the patient. it was theirrecommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up. ifnegative and diarrhea persists, the patient should have acolonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held(at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stentplacement. at the time of discharge, the patient's diarrhea waswell-controlled with loperamide and the patient was toleratingfluids po. he was encouraged to have aggressive po fluid intakewhenever diarrhea occurs..# fevers. the patient had a low-grade (100) fever after comingto the floor from the micu. this may be secondary to the sameprocess as the diarrhea. however, the patient has poorlycontrolled hiv and therefore is at risk for numerous sources.empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection wasfound..# hypotension. likely secondary to persistent diarrhea. thepatient was aggressively hydrated with iv ns in the micu. hecame to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume statusfor the remainder of his time in the hospital..# acute renal failure. likely pre-renal secondary to persistentdiarrhea and volume depletion. the patient's cr improved tonormal range after volume resuscitation..# chest pain. the patient had a cta that was negative for pe. hehad a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demandischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponinexcretion in the setting of renal failure. the patient'stroponin trended downward throughout his admission and he nevershowed ck elevations..# cad. no signs of acute ischemia. troponin leak with normal cklikely secondary to demand ischemia and arf. the patient wascontinued on asa, plavix, beta blocker, statin. his acei washeld for renal failure and then restarted prior to discharge. onecho, the patient had new mechanical dysfunction. the patientshould have outpatient p-mibi to assess for perfusion deficits..# hiv. on [2192-9-11], cd4 72, vl>100,000. the patient's haart hasbeen held while in the micu for renal failure. these medicationswere restarted prior to discharge. the patient's pcp willconsider initiating prophylactic antibiotics as an outpatient..# anemia. patient's baseline appears 29-30. patient with drop inhct likely in part secondary to dilution. the patient had guaiacpositive stool with known abnormal colonoscopy and egd in pastis concerning for gi bleed. the patient had multiple units ofblood transfusion while in the micu. his hct normalized prior todischarge..# thrombocytopenia. the patient's platelets declined to 90 whilein the micu and he was found to be hit antibody positive.heparin products were held and the patient's
