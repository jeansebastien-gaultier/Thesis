:1. coronary disease status post myocardial infarction in the past .the date and characteristics are unknown , however , upon obtained old ekgs from the both the hospitalization and raburging health as well as admission to ihamilfnas terkohodelf hospital show that at the time of the myocardial infarction appears to have been april of 1996 and the distribution appears to be an anterior myocardial

nursing home resident .she was married and has two daughters .physical examination :on physical exam she was drowsy but cooperative .blood pressure 140/90 .heart rate 84 and regular .respiratory rate 20 .she was afebrile with a temperature of 98 f .her sat was 96% on room air .head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam showed normal cephalic atraumatic .pupils were equal but small .her extraocular movements were intact .her mucous membranes were moist and pink without lesions .her neck was supple with no cervical lymphadenopathy .her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .heart was tachycardia with some irregularity .she had no jugular venous distention .she had a normal s1 and s2 and no murmurs , gallops or rubs were noted .her abdomen was soft , nondistended and nontender .bowel sounds were positive .there was no hepatosplenomegaly .her extremities showed 2+ dp and pt pulses .they were warm and pink .her neurological exam :she was drowsy .she was oriented to her name and place but not to time .her affect was somewhat blunted but her answers were appropriate .her tongue was normal and she had a slight resting tremor of her right hand .her toes were down going bilaterally .her rectal showed guaiac negative brown stool .laboratory data on admission :her admission labs were remarkable for a na145 .k 3.4 .cl 103 .bicarb 23.9 .bun 14 .creatinine 1.2 .glucose 112 .amylase 47 .her white blood cell count 9.6 .hematocrit 43.7 .platelets 226 .mcv 91 .her differential on her white count 61% polys , 27% lymphs , 12% monos .pt 13.5 .ptt 28.0 .her chest x-ray showed normal heart size , no infiltrates no pulmonary edema .her ekg was sinus at a rate of 114 with normal intervals , axis of -30 .she had q waves in v1 and v2 with biphasic t waves in v2-v4 and also noted were a q wave in v3 and no st depressions were noted .there were slight st elevation in v1-v2 suspicious for potential septal aneurysm .she also had subsequent ekgs which were remarkable for frequent premature ventricular complexes , however no ischemic changes were noted otherwise .when compared with her ekg of 4/24/96 she had lost her r wave in v2 .her t wave which had been inverted on a prior ekg now were upright across the precordium .there was no change between her pain and pain free ekgs .assessment :this is a 74 year old woman with a vague poorly defined history of coronary disease and ekgs and history consistent with previous myocardial infarction who now presents hypertension , tachycardia , nausea and chest tightness with ekg changes .hospital course and treatment :hospital course by system :1. cardiac :the patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .she was placed on nitropaste .she was given metoprolol 25 mg po bid .she was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with cks of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , she was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on 7/31/96 which showed an ef of 35% .she had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .there was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .the estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .the right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .there was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ace inhibitor , captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .this was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .she also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test on 8/1/96 which showed nondiagnostic ekg response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .she will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as metoprolol 25 mg po bid .given her recent start on an ace inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , bun and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ace inhibitor .given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .however , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .she will not be transferred on lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .neurology :from a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .she was initially managed with prn haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including depakote , prozac , klonopin and trilafon .she gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .however , she does express frequent need for attention .she appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .in talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .3. hypertension :from the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ace inhibitor as mentioned above .the nifedipine was discontinued on 8/1/96 in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ace inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .orthopedics :she did have right knee pain and swelling .she underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .discharge instructions :she will be followed by dr. nelson who follows her at the montden hospital .she will be transferred on 8/2/96 in good condition .transfer medications :metropolol 25 mg po bid , captopril 25 mg po tid , depakote 250 mg po qid , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd , colace 100 mg potid , prozac 20 mg po qd , clonipine .5 mg po qhs , trilifon 2 mg po bid and darvocet 1 tab po q6h prn for pain .her diet should be low cholesterol and low sodium diet and she will followup as above .            shastimaferm n. top , m.d.tr :            wedd :td :            08/02/96 6:54acc :
