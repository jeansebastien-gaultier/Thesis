mdchief complaint: cough , nausea , vomiting , and chest pain.history of present illness: the patient is a 64-year-old femalewith a past medical history significant for coronary arterydisease , diabetes , hypertension , chf , and copd who was admittedon 2/21/05 after presenting to the emergency departmentcomplaining of three weeks of feeling unwell. the patient statesthat approximately three weeks prior to admission , she developedincreased lower extremity edema. she also noted increased coughand shortness of breath. approximately two weeks prior to theadmission , she doubled her lasix dose without much improvement inher symptoms. about one week prior to the admission , she beganto have abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting. she continued tohave cough and shortness of breath at this time. the eveningprior to presentation , she had substernal chest pain , whichradiated to her arm x1 hour. this pain improved after taking twosublingual nitroglycerin tables. she presented to the emergencydepartment the following day complaining of shortness of breathand fatigue.in the emergency department , the patient's vital signs were notedto be heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 94/40 with o2 sat 98%on room air. she was complaining of shortness of breath andfatigue. her blood pressure subsequently decreased further to77/48. at this time , she was bolused with iv fluids ,approximately 1.5 to 2 liters. following the fluid bolus , shedeveloped wheezing and was treated with nebulizers. however , shebecame more nauseated and dyspneic and her blood pressurecontinued to fall. dopamine was started for blood pressuresupport. when she continued to desaturate into the 80% range andshe was subsequently intubated. an echocardiogram at the bedtimeshowed a globally depressed ejection fraction of 25%. inaddition , her labs returned with an elevated troponin of 4.5.she had a subsequent chest x-ray , which documented pulmonaryedema. she was admitted for flash pulmonary edema and wastransferred directly from the emergency department to the cardiaccath laboratory. in the cath lab , her bypass grafts of the limato the lad and svg to omb were noted to be patent. however , allthe other grafts were occluded. no interventions wereundertaken. she was also noted to have elevated right andleft-sided pressures with right atrial pressure of 32 and a meanpulmonary artery pressure of 51 and a left wedge pressure of 40.she was subsequently transferred to the ccu where she was alsonoted to have a serum creatinine of 2.3 and making very smallamounts of urine. a ph at that time was 7.13. her cardiacoutput , cardiac index ratios were 6.8 to 3. she was treated withsodium bicarb and lasix iv drip. overnight , she developed abrisk diuresis and her hypotension resolved. an echocardiogramobtained on hospital day two showed an estimated ejectionfraction of 45%. the entire inferior wall was noted to beakinetic. the posterior wall was moderately hypokinetic. globalright ventricular systolic function was severely reduced. shewas also note to have a thickened , calcified mitral valve withsevere mitral regurgitation.her ccu course was notable for two positive blood cultures , onedrawn on 2/21/05 and the other drawn on 4/10/05 for which shewas started first on vancomycin and then switched to nafcillinfor coag-negative staph bacteremia. she was also diagnosed witha uti and started on levofloxacin. she was eventually extubatedon 11/18/05. she was discharged from the ccu on 10/30/05 , andwas accepted on to the cards aworth service.past medical history:1.

subsequently trended down.hospital course: following discharge from the coronary careunit: in summary , the patient is a 64-year-old female , admittedon 2/21/05 , complaining of subacute progressive symptoms of chfin addition to a more acute onset of nausea and vomiting. shepresented to the emergency department hypotensive , which wasprobably related to dehydration due to decreased p.o. intake aswell as continued lasix use. when given iv fluids , she went intoflash pulmonary edema , requiring transfer to the ccu andintubation. the patient underwent emergent cath , which showed nonew intervenable disease , but did show severe mr. she wasadmitted to the ccu where she was aggressively diuresed andweaned of the vent. she was transferred to the floor on4/13/05.her hospital course by system is as follows.cardiac ischemia. the patient underwent catheterization on2/21/05 , which showed 100% obstruction in the svg to rca graft ,60% obstruction in the rima to the marginal 1 graft , patent limato the lad , and patent svg to om1 and om2. note was made ofmarkedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures. nostents were placed. we continued management of her ischemia withaspirin , beta-blocker , lipitor , and imdur. in addition , westarted an ace inhibitor , which had been initially held due toher hypotension. this was restarted on 10/30/05 for afterloadreduction , given her severe mitral regurgitation. over thecourse of her ccu stay and her hospital stay on the cardiacservice , she continued to clinically improve. we felt that hermitral regurgitation was likely dynamic , related to her chf flareand ischemia. we would recommend outpatient echo for furtherfollow-up of her mitral regurgitation.rhythm. the patient at baseline has paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , on coumadin. here , she was noted to be in normalsinus rhythm. her coumadin dose was held for two nights from10/30/05 to 6/5/05 for planned tee echo and a small dose ofvitamin k was given. subsequently , the tee was later canceled.we are therefore restarting the patient on her home dose ofcoumadin , but her inr may rise somewhat slowly due to the vitamink. we have asked her to have her labs checked on 9/13/05 for aninr check.infectious disease. the patient was noted to have two positivecultures for coag-negative staph , one drawn on 2/21/05 and onedrawn on 5/29/05. she was initially started on vancomycin on2/30/05 and then switched to nafcillin based on hersensitivities. the plan was to obtain a tee to evaluate her forendocarditis. however , on further review of the sensitivity , weconclude that two bottles represent two different coag-negativestaph species. we feel that this most likely representscontamination rather than true bacteremia. this was discussedwith the id fellow who agreed with our assessment. therefore ,the tee was discontinued and antibiotics were also discontinued.we asked that the patient have surveillance blood cultureschecked on 9/13/05 while off all antibiotics.the patient also had a positive ua while in the ccu and wasstarted on levofloxacin for a uti. however , her urine culturesnever grew an organism. so , this was discontinued on 6/16/05.pulmonary. the patient has a history of copd. she was continuedon her home inhalers as well as nebulizers as needed. shereceived one course of pulse dose steroids while in the ccu forpresumed copd infection. this was discontinued prior to heradmission to the floor.renal. on presentation , the patient had evidence of acute renalfailure with creatinine elevated at 2.3. however , this improvedwith diuresis. she also had an mri of the kidneys to evaluatefor renal artery stenosis on 6/16/05. this showed severediffuse atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta , but norenal artery stenosis. the radiologist recommends a ct angiogramfor further work if clinically indicated as an outpatient.endocrine. the patient has a history of diabetes and is onlantus and metformin at home. here , we held her metformin doseand treated her instead with insulin sliding scale and lantus.we have asked the patient to restart her metformin upondischarge.fen. the patient's goal in's and out's should be even to -500 mlper day. we increased her home lasix dose from 80 mg daily to 80mg in the morning and 40 mg at night. these doses should besubsequently adjusted to maintain her volume status as anoutpatient.code. status is full code.disposition: the patient was discharged home on 1/7/05 withvna services. vna should assist the patient with her medicationsas well as volume status checks , daily weights , and lung exams.she has a follow-up appointment already scheduled with herprimary care doctor , dr. wagenheim , on 9/29/05 at 2:30 p.m. inaddition , dr. rayome of the cardiology service will seethe patient as an outpatient. the exact appointment time anddate are pending at the time of this dictation. the office hasindicated that they will call the patient for a specificappointment time.medications on discharge:1. aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily.2. ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d.3. lasix 80 mg in the morning and 40 mg at night.4. magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o.
