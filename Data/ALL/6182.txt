improvedduring his hospital stay. he had diarrhea, and was found to bepositive for c.dif (presumably [1-1] recent abx treatment forsbp), and was placed on flagyl. he was treated with octreotide,midodrine, and albumin for likely hrs. he was initially treatedwith levofloxacin, but this was d/c'd after a negative urine cx.pt also reportedly underwent therapetuic paracentesis (12

and w/u for liver transplant.# cirrhosis: patient's cirrhosis most likely secondary toalcohol and patient was admitted with multiple complications.ultrasound at osh demonstrated possible portal vein thrombosis,although this finding was not present on 1st doppler study at[hospital1 18]. patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis many timesduring this admission. he was always negative for sbp. he wascontinued on cipro for sbp prophylaxis. pt's initial u/s wasunremarkable for portal vein thrombus, subsequent abd u/s withdoppler as well as ct and mri, notable for portal vein thrombus.anticoagulation was contraindicated given his thrombocytopenia,pt also developed some oozing around temporary central lines.his clot then extended into svc and was no longer a candidatefor transplant surgery. further transplant work up stopped andpt was made dnr/dni given no further options for treatment..# renal failure: patient was admitted with oliguric renalfailure. patient's renal function decreased rapidly during thisepisode of hepatic decompensation,  suggesting hepatorenalsyndrome although likely compounded by intravascular depletionand increased intra-abdominal pressure. patient was started onoctreotide, midodrine, and albumin at the osh. patient's sbpdropped during hd from base line bp of 90's to low 80's. he wasthen transferred to the icu for cvvh. he tolerated severalsessions of hd. plan for continued hd as outpatient as pt wouldlike to continue hd. plan was to provide hd as outpatient closeto home. the patient was admitted to the micu for ongoing cvvhdgiven his pressures were prohibitive for traditional hd. thepatient was maintained on midodrine and octreotide for possiblehepatorenal syndrome and was additionally treated with ivalbumin, which was discontinued on [2150-7-11]. midodrine wasincreased to 12.5mg [hospital1 ]. the patient's pressures tolerated cvvhdwell and his creatinine decreased from 5.9 to 2.5. he hasrequired dialysis, though, since being transferred from the micuto the floor, and his renal function has not improved.unfortunately, given his coagulopathy, he has had issues withbleeding from the dialysis catheter site following dialysis. hedid not bleed following his last course of hemodialysis and wasdeemed safe to go home..# coagulopathy: pt developed some oozing around line sites. labsshowed picture consistent with dic but this could also be fromunderlying liver disease. he received ffp/cryo beforeprocedures. he recieved several units of prbc for low hct butremained stable. had some bleeding from tunneled line. was givenconjugated estrogen and vitamin k x 3 doses..# hepatic encephalopathy: during this admission, patient hadwaxing and [doctor last name 688] mental status, suggesting likely hepaticencephalopathy. patient's mental status much improved withlactulose therapy. the patient was maintained on lactulose forencephalopathy. he was noted to have some fluctuation in mentalstatus but was generally appropriate and oriented..# liver mass: patient also noted to have hepatic mass onabdominal ultrasound, suggestive for possible hcc although afponly 2.9. unclear etiology of
