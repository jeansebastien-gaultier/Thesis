mdservice: cardiac surgery.history of present illness: the patient is a 66-year-old malewho was being worked up for other surgery and during preoperativetesting he was noted to have an abnormal ekg. this prompted acardiac stress test , which was abnormal. he therefore receivedadditional cardiac workup and was found to have coronary arterydisease. he does have a history of atrial fibrillation in thepast , but reports that he has not had any symptoms prior to hisinitially planned shoulder surgery. he therefore presented forcabg rather than having shoulder surgery.past medical history:1. hypertension.2. diabetes.3. hyperlipidemia.4. copd.5. bph.6. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.7. nephrolithiasis.8. impotence.9. bursitis.10. non-allergic rhinitis.11. history of hepatitis in 1960.12. constipation.13. right-sided renal artery stenosis.14. renal insufficiency.past surgical history:1. left rotator cuff repair in 1991.2. tonsillectomy.3. thumb surgery in childhood.family history: no history of coronary artery disease.social history: the patient has a history of smoking. he alsodrinks approximately 2 beers per month.allergies: procainamide , which causes diarrhea and arthralgia ,also verapamil , which can cause constipation.medications upon admission:1. toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.2. lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.3. propafenone 150 mg p.o. q.d.4. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.5. rhinocort

, blood pressure 130/88 in theright arm and 142/88 in the left arm. heent: pupils equal ,round , and reactive to light. extraocular movements are intact.mucous membranes are moist. oropharynx is clear. there are nocarotid bruits. dentition is without evidence of infection.chest is free of incisions. cardiovascular: regular rate andrhythm. there are no murmurs. pulses: carotid , radial ,femoral , dorsalis pedis , and posterior tibialis pulses are all 2+bilaterally. allen's test in the left upper extremity was normalwith using a pulse oximeter. respiratory: the patient has clearbreath sounds bilaterally. abdomen: there are no incisions.abdomen is soft , nontender , and nondistended with normoactivebowel sounds. extremities: are free of scarring , varicositiesor edema. neurologic: the patient is alert and oriented. hehas no focal deficits.labs upon admission: sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 105 ,bicarbonate 28 , bun 18 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 178 , magnesium 2 ,white count 8 , hematocrit 38.5 , hemoglobin 13.6 , platelets 163 ,pt 16 , inr 1.3 , ptt 34.9. urinalysis is normal. cardiaccatheterization done on 8/28/04 revealed a 90% ostial ladlesion , 70% ostial ramus , 90% mid d1 , 80% ostial d3 , 75% proximalcircumflex , 50% ostial rca , 90% proximal pda. there was rightdominant circulation and 75%-80% right renal artery stenosis. hehad an ejection fraction of approximately 60%.hospital course: the patient was admitted to hospital on4/25/04 and was taken to the operating room on 10/19/04 where hereceived a five-vessel cabg in which the left internal mammaryartery was sewn to the lad. saphenous vein graft 1 to firstdiagonal artery. right internal mammary artery was sewn to theramus. the left radial artery was harvested and sewn to lvb2 andlvb1. bypass time was 159 minutes. cross clamp time 111minutes. postoperatively , he was taken to the cardiac intensivecare unit where he was hemodynamically stable. he was rapidlyweaned of the ventilator without problems. he did develop a boutof rapid atrial fibrillation in the first two dayspostoperatively. this was treated by restarting the patient'spropafenone , which he was taken preoperatively for atrialfibrillation. the patient's other primary issue postoperativelywhile in the intensive care unit was an episode of oliguria , nearanuria. a renal consult was obtained at this time. he didreceive a bilateral renal ultrasound , which showed kidneys to beessentially equal in size with no hydronephrosis. he was startedon low-dose dopamine and once his systolic pressure went back tohis baseline preoperative systolic pressure of approximately 160 ,he began to make adequate amounts of urine. it was thereforedetermined that his renal perfusion is largely pressure dependentwith him requiring a mean pressure of close to 100. he remainedhemodynamically stable. he did have some constipation , which wastreated with an aggressive bowel regimen and subsequentlyresolved. he will be transferred out to the cardiac step-downunit on 9/7/04.the remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated at thetime of discharge.escription document: 7-1741956
