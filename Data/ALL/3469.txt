found to havepericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentiesis with drain inplace, transferred to ccu for post-operative monitoring, withfrequent agitation, now found to have bilateral pes.# pericardial effusion:  in the micu, pt noted to be tachycardicwith hypotension, and found to have pericardial effusion.  heunderwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement with drainageof bloody fluid.  hct stable despite profuse bloody drainage.etiology is likely malignancy given that ct torso showing rullung spiculated nodule. effusion cytology and micro showed cellsc/w metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.  drain was eventually pulledwithout complication and without any further hemodynamicinstability.  pulsus checked for several days after drain pulledand resolved effusion on echo, was

wasstarted on heparin ggt in house and transitioned to ananticoagulation regimen of coumadin, with a lovenox bridge.  hewill f/u with his pcp on [name9 (pre) 2974] [2-12] after discharge..#  agitation: patient with history of etoh, marijuana,cocaine/crack binges. he was significantly agitated throughoutadmission which was initially thought to be secondary to etohwithdrawal.  he was maintained on a valium ciwa and klonipin 1mgtid.  however, agitation persisted despite being well out of theacute withdrawal window.  he had several code purples called forhim and was often violent towards nurses. of note, pt would belucid and engaging often during the day with decompensation atnight.  psych was consulted who felt that this was less likelyto be withdrawal and instead a behavioral issue/delerium, likelyin setting of supratherapeutic valproate level.  theyrecommended haldol for his agitation which was continued 5mg prnalong with 10mg qhs standing, these were discontinued ondischarge, takes no psych meds at home and delirium apparentlycleared.  evaluated by psychiatry prior to discharge, appearedto understand importance of f/u.  he was started on mvi,thiamine, folate..# afib with rvr: patient oscillates between hr of 70s ?????? 170swith frequent episodes of rvr on tele, asymptomatic. based onold records, has a history of afib with rvr, a flutter, wastreated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be onmetoprolol.  increased metoprolol to 75 mg po qid standing whichhas controlled rate well, though still with frequent episodes ofrapid ventricular response that respond to iv lopressor 5 mg x1.  because of continued episodes of rvr (likely in the settingof pericardial effusion and multiple pes) pt started ondiltiazem drip, weaned off and started on diltiazem er 120 mgdaily, and metoprolol changed to 200 mg of metoprolol succinateon discharge.  hr in the 60s with these changes, with shortbursts of svt to 130s prior to discharge.  would consideruptitrating rate control as an outpatient..#. h/o epilepsy and seizure activity: vns placed and wasre-activated about 1 week after placement.  he was continuedhome aeds.   depakote er 1250/1500/1500 and oxcarbazepine 600 mg[hospital1 ] which was often given iv due to inability to take pos fromagitation.  depakote level was found to be elevated in settingof delirium, however unclear if this was true trough.  wasdischarged on home meds and advised to f/u with his outpatientneurologist for management of his depakote..# foley self-d/c:  pt pulled own foley overnight [1-30].  of notethere was blood around the uerethral meatus after he pulled it.urine output was monitored and foley ended up being replaced on[2-2] given that he was put back into 4pt restraints.

diagnosis:seizure disorderatrial fibrillationlung adenocarcinoma, pericardial effusiondeep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolismdischarge condition:mental status: confused - sometimes.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:you were seen in the hospital to have your vagal nervestimulator replaced, which has been turned on again, for yourseizures.you were also found to have a very fast heart rate from youratrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate) and for this westarted diltiazem and metoprolol, which slow your heart rate.in addition, you were found to have a pericardial effusion(fluid around your heart) which is likely due to spreading oflung cancer, which was discovered on a ct scan.  you were seenby the oncologists here who recommended that you go to clinicfor follow up to discuss further workup and treatment.you were also found to have a pulmonary embolism and deep veinthrombosis (blood clots in your lung and legs) for which youwere started a blood thinner.  you will be taking a bloodthinner called coumadin to prevent more clots from forming andto treat the ones you already have, and you should take thismedication every day.  you will be taking lovenox, another bloodthinner which works immediately, temporarily until your bloodlevel of coumadin reaches the therapeutic range.changes to your medications:start diltiazem 120 mg every daystart taking metoprolol 200 mg dailystart taking warfarin 5 mg dailystart taking lovenox shots twice a day until you are told tostop by your
