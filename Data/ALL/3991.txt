mdservice:cardiac surgery service.history of present illness:mr. serafine is a 78-year-old gentleman who presented withincreasing dyspnea on exertion and new york heartassociation class iii heart failure. the patient also complained of fatigueover the last four years prior to admission. he currently deniedany angina , diaphoresis , nausea , orthopnea , pnd , presyncope orsyncope. the patient had been treated with serial transthoracicechocardiograms which revealed an ejection fraction worseningfrom 60% down to 40% along with aortic stenosis. the patient underwentcardiac catheterization , which revealed no significant coronary artery diseaseand elevated left and rightheart filling pressures. cardiac catheterization was abandonedprematurely due to the increasing filling pressures. echocardiogram wasperformed which revealed an ejection fraction of 40% , aortic stenosis with amean gradient of 31 mmhg , a peak gradient of 50 mmhg , calculated valvearea of 0.7 cm2 , mild mitral insufficiency , mild tricuspidinsufficiency , mild left atrial enlargement , moderatelyhypertrophied left ventricle , global reduction in leftventricular function more in the apex of the left ventriclemildly enlarged right ventricle with preserved right ventricularfunction , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve withsignificant restriction and leaflet excursion , reduction leftventricular function compared to previous transthoracic echo oneyear prior to this present study.past medical history:significant for class iii heart failure with marked limitation ofphysical activity , diabetes mellitus insulin-dependent ,dyslipidemia , cardiac arrest , status post cardiac catheterizationon 7/13/05 .  the patient's course was complicated by markedbradycardia requiring insertion of a temporary pacemaker via aright internal jugular and then complete heart block requiring ast. jude dual chamber pacemaker and generator.past surgical history:significant for permanent pacemaker placement , status postcholecystectomy , history of skin cancer , and status posttonsillectomy.allergies:patient has no known drug allergies.medications on admission:atenolol 12.5 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , metformin 500 mgb.i.d. , and humalog insulin 12 units q.i.d.physical examination:per physical exam , 5 feet 10 inches tall , 138 kilograms ,temperature 96 , heart rate 80 and regular , blood pressure rightarm 110/65 , left arm 112/60 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air.cardiovascular: regular rate , and rhythm with 2/6 systolicejection murmur. peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterallythroughout. respiratory: breath sounds clear bilaterally.neurologic: alert and oriented with no focal deficits ,otherwise noncontributory.admission labs:sodium 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 106 , co2 27 , bun of 13 ,creatinine 0.8 , glucose 156 , and magnesium 1.9. wbc 5.91 ,hematocrit 46 , hemoglobin 16.4 , platelets of 181 , 000 , pt of 12.9 ,pt/inr of 1 , and ptt 28.1.hospital course:mr. delcour was brought to the operating room on 7/9/07where he underwent a minimally invasive aortic valve replacementwith a 25-mm carpentier-edwards pericardial valve. total bypasstime was 101 minutes , total crossclamp time was 63 minutes. intraoperatively ,the patient was found to have a calcified trileafletaortic valve. the patient came off bypass without incident , was brought to theintensive care unit on 3 mcg of epinephrine and insulin andprecedex. the patient did well and was brought up in stablecondition in normal sinus rhythm. postoperatively , the patientwas extubated and the electrophysiology service was consulted toevaluate his internal pacemaker which was reprogrammed andfunctioning well. the patient continued to require vigorousdiuresis with a lasix drip. he was extubated on postoperative day #1 withoutincident. the patient was transferred to the step-down unit onpostoperative day 5. the patient experienced some postoperativetachycardia and his beta-blocker was increased with good result.he was also found to have a positive urinary tract infection andwas started on ciprofloxacin for a total of five days. thepatient at one point required 5 liters of nasal cannula to gethis saturations in the 90s. he did continue to requireintravenous lasix but had weaned lasix drip and had intermittentboluses of 40 mg iv to promote diuresis with good result. he wasweaned off his oxygen and the patient began to ambulate and wascleared for discharge to home with visiting nurse onpostoperative day #9.discharge labs:are as follows sodium 139 , potassium 4.0 , chloride of 102 , co2 of30 , bun 15 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 163 , magnesium 1.8 , wbc 9.52 ,hematocrit 33.1 , hemoglobin 10.8 , platelets of 286 ,
