11/16/2005attending: leifer , jefferey graham mdprincipal diagnoses: endocarditis , urinary tract infection.secondary diagnoses: mitral regurgitation , diabetes ,hypertension , congestive heart failure , recurrent utis , uterineprolapse , hyperlipidemia , hiatal hernia , right breast nodule.history of present illness: the patient is a 76-year-old with ahistory of severe mitral regurgitation , history of congestiveheart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% in 7/24 , chronicabdominal discomfort , history of recurrent utis , and uterineprolapse , who one week prior to admission developed increasednausea , decreased appetite , weakness , fatigue and increased lowback pain. no vomiting , diarrhea , cough , or dysuria. onpresentation , the patient was found to be hypotensive , in septicshock , with bacteremia in urinary tract infection and admitted tothe medical icu for pressure support.admission physical examination: notable for heart rate of 94 ,blood pressure of 80-90/50. notable for heart exam with regularrate and rhythm , normal s1 and s2 , with 3/6 systolic crescendomurmur and decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal borderradiating to the clavicles and carotids , and 3/6 holosystolicmurmur at the apex radiating to the axilla , and an apical heave.jvp flat. chest with crackles in the right middle lung fields andleg basilar crackles. abdominal exam was benign. guaiacnegative. extremities with no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema and1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.relevant studies and tests: blood culture on 9/10streptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin mic0.19. urine culture on 9/10 greater than 100 , 000 klebsiellapneumoniae , ampicillin resistant , gentamicin sensitive , andlevofloxacin sensitive. tee on 0/14 severe mitralregurgitation , posterior leaflet with mitral calcifications andlinear density concerning for endocarditis.hospital course:impression: a 76-year-old female with mitral regurgitation ,history of chf , history of recurrent uti , who presented withnausea and chills , had hypotension requiring a medical icu stay x2 days , with streptococcus viridans bacteremia and mitralcalcifications in linear density concerning for endocarditis plusklebsiella uti.1. infectious disease: the patient presented with chills andhypotension and was admitted to the micu from the ed fortreatment of septic shock. her mean arterial pressures were keptabove 65 with levophed. she initially was treated withlevofloxacin and vancomycin to treat gram-positive coccibacteremia and uti. blood culture from 10/22 , grew outstreptococcus viridans , levofloxacin sensitive , penicillin mic0.19. urine culture was positive for klebsiella , ampicillinresistant , gentamicin and levofloxacin sensitive. on 3/18 ,antibiotics were changed to penicillin 3 million units iv q.4h.and gentamicin 50 mg iv q.8h. atee on 10/19 showed severe mitralregurgitation with posterior leaflet calcifications and lineardensity concerning for endocarditis. therefore , a picc line wasplaced on 1/19 for continuation of a six-week course ofpenicillin 3 million units iv q.4h. until 0/12 and two-weekcourse of gentamicin 50 mg iv q.8h. until 2/25 .  she will followup in the infectious disease clinic with dr. ramiro halcom on0/9/05 at 8 a.m.2. cardiovascular: ischemia: the patient was maintained onaspirin. lipitor was initially helped for an initialtransaminitis presumed to be secondary to shock liver , that atthe time of discharge her liver enzymes had normalized and shewas restarted on her lipitor. pump: the patient has a historyof congestive heart failure , with an ejection fraction 60% in7/24 .  she had hypotension , requiring levophed until 11/0 .  shehad an episode of flash pulmonary edema on 11/9 in the settingof fluid bolus and one unit of packed red blood cells. she has avery attenuatus balance between preload dependence and overload.her lasix and ace-i were held while she was hypotensive. becauseher systolic blood pressure continued to be low in the 90s andlow 100s , attempt was not made to re-add the ace while in thehospital. it is anticipated that her cardiologist and outpatientphysicians will attempt to add the ace back onto her medicalregimen for better afterload reduction as her blood pressuretolerates. the patient also has a very severe mitralregurgitation , which would be one of the reasons that an ace onher medication regimen would be beneficial. rhythm: the patientwas maintained on telemetry , and was found to be a normal sinusrhythm with ectopy , including short once of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia. she was started on lopressor 12.5 mgt.i.d. on 3/18 , and this was increased to 25 mg b.i.d. atdischarge , with her heart rates continuing to be between the 70sand the 90s , however , with less episodes of ectopy. herelectrolytes were also well repleted.3. gastrointestinal: the patient had evidence of shock liver( 0/24 with an alt of 135 , ast of 177 , alkaline phosphatase of251 , and t bili of 1.7 ) that is now resolving. lipitor was held ,and was started as a transaminitis resolved. non-contrast ct ofthe abdomen showed biliary sludge and gallstones , no evidence ofacute cholecystitis. right upper quadrant ultrasound confirmedthe ct findings. colon cancer is a concern with the patient'sanemia being new since 0/29 .  her last colonoscopy was in 2000 ,and she will benefit from repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.she was continued on nexium for prophylaxis. heme: the patienthad guaiac positive stools in the medical icu , her hematocrit wasstable around 33%. she has a microcytic anemia with an mcv of79 , her iron studies ( iron of 10 , tibc of 191 , ferritin is 744 )suggesting anemia of chronic disease with possibly overlying irondeficiency.4. endocrine: the patient had a normal random cortisol level of35.3. she had an uncertain diagnosis of diabetes and was on theportland protocol in the medical icu. hemoglobin a1c , however ,was 6.5. therefore , she was maintained thereafter only oninsulin sliding scale and rarely required any coverage.5. prophylaxis: the patient was kept on lovenox and protonix.discharge medications: aspirin 81 mg daily , iron sulfate 325 mgdaily , gentamicin sulfate 50 mg iv q.8h. until 2/25 for atwo-week course , penicillin g potassium 3 million units iv q.4h.until 0/12 for a six-week course , lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. ,caltrate plus d2 tablets p.o. daily , lipitor 10 mg daily , andprotonix 40 mg daily. the patient has not been restarted on herhome lasix and lisinopril secondary to persistently low bloodpressures between the 90s and 100s. it is anticipated thatespecially her lisinopril and her lasix will be added back on toher medical regimen as her blood pressure tolerates. given thatshe was no longer on lasix , she was also taken potassiumchloride.disposition: the patient is to be discharged to rehabilitationat acanmingpeerra virg tantblu medical center in order to be able to get her antibiotictherapy. she was discharged on stable condition.physicians follow-up: the patient has been following follow-upappointments:1. stress test in 7/27/05 at 3 p.m.2. dr. gale montante ( general cardiology ) on 11/13/05 at 10 a.m.3. dr. ed storti 3/15/05 at 12 p.m.4. dr. stacey koers ( infectious disease ) 0/9/05 at 8 a.m.the patient will follow up regarding the success of herantibiotic therapy. it is also anticipated that her cardiologistwill re-add back on her ace for better afterload reduction as herblood pressures tolerates , and potentially we will add her backon to the lasix as well. she will require weekly lab draws tocheck her electrolytes and cbc while she is on the antibiotics.consultants: infectious disease , dr. rupert zenon , pagernumber
