the patient carries thediagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease withmultiple admissions and intubations, all of which seemed toresolve rather quickly once the patient was intubated.  thisone was similar.  within 24 hours after admission the patientwas easily extubated and did quite well after that, makinggreat improvement, back to his baseline within two days.  itwas felt that this is not consistent with either an asthmaattack or a true chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseexacerbation or infection.  there is concern that some otherprocess was causing the patient's acute episodes of shortnessof breath.  in fact, it is not clear the extent of hisrespiratory distress when he was intubated in the field,initially even though he was oxygenating well and had poorbreath sounds at baseline.  the patient was treated with high-dose steroids initially as well as q. 4 hour nebulizerinhalers.  however, his lungs have been clear almostimmediately upon admission.  because of concern that theremight be airway collapse contributing, the patient underwenta computerized tomography scan which was designed to look fortracheomalacia.  the computerized tomography scan wasmisprotocoled and this could not be evaluated.  there was asuspicion that there might be left main stem bronchuscollapse during expiration and it was read as probable distaltracheomalacia.  the patient was provided with a bipapmachine and teaching.  he responded very well to this atnighttime.  it was suggested that he use the bipap atnighttime and as needed when he feels short of breath and hisshortness of breath is not helped by his usual nebulizers.the hope is that this might prevent him from needing to call911 and from repeated intubations.  the patient did receiveone dose of levofloxacin, however, there is no sign ofinfection and this antibiotic was discontinued.hypotension - the patient was initially hypotensive in the[hospital unit name 153].  this was after receiving propofol and then othersedating medications.  he required pressors briefly fordopamine which increased his heart rate and made himtachycardiac.  he was then switched to levophed.  it was feltthis was all in the setting of sedating medications as wellas ventilator positive end-expiratory pressure as the patientdid not actually appear septic at any time, he has had all ofthat quite well and was normotensive once he was extubated,in fact, on discharge he was restarted on his blood pressuremedications.hypertension - the patient has hypertension as an outpatientat baseline.  his metoprolol and ace inhibitor were held.initially they were restarted on the day of discharge.coronary artery disease - the patient has a coronary arterydisease history.  he was continued on his aspirin and hislipitor during the admission.  in the setting of hypotension,he did have some hyperacute t waves on electrocardiogram.his enzymes were cycled and they were negative forinfarction.  as noted, his metoprolol and ace inhibitor wererestarted prior to discharge.renal failure - initially the patient presented with elevatedlactate and slightly elevated creatinine but these correctedquickly with fluids.prophylaxis - the patient was continued on a proton pumpinhibitors as well as with heparin subcutaneously while inthe hospital.  he was then ambulatory by the day ofdischarge.code status - the patient confirmed that he is a full code.disposition:  the patient will be discharged to home with hisusual services.  he will also be provided with a bipapmachine for use as described above.  the patient shouldfollow up with both his primary care physician and dr.[last name (stitle) 575] within the next one to two weeks.discharge instructions:  resumed medications as beforeincluding a taper of prednisone.call your primary doctor or the emergency department with anyconcerns for shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea orvomiting.see your primary doctor, dr.
