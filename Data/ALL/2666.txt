patient had increasing chest pain over the past monthprogressing to pain at rest. the patient presented with substernalchest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressureof 230/90. the patient's blood pressure was controlled with ivlopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardialinfarction. the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on2/25/99 which revealed the following: a stent restenosis of leftcircumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending arterystenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percentostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostialposterior descending artery stenosis. no myocardial infarction wasnoted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percentcalculated. the patient was subsequently scheduled for coronaryartery bypass graft.past medical history: coronary artery disease. hypertension.congestive heart failure. type ii diabetesmellitus requiring insulin. peripheral vascular disease.gastroesophageal reflux disease.past surgical history: left lower extremity revascularization.physical examination: spanish-speaking female. heent:unremarkable. carotid pulses 1 plusbilaterally with no bruits. lungs clear to auscultationbilaterally. heart: regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs.abdomen: soft , nontender , nondistended. firm to palpation in bothlower quadrants in area of lower midline scar. extremities:tenderness to palpation in bilateral lower extremities which wasdiffuse and nonspecific. peripheral pulses revealed 1 plusdorsalis pedis pulse and 1 plus posterior tibial pulse on rightlower extremity and 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse and 2 plusposterior tibial pulse on left lower extremity with 1 plus edemabilaterally. neurologic: the patient was conscious and alert andoriented times three with no deficits.laboratory data: sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , bun 18 , creatinine1.0 , glucose 205. wbc 12 , hematocrit 37 , inr0.1. ecg revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific st-t wavechanges.medications: aspirin 325 mg q.d. , atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , colace , axid 150 mgp.o. b.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o.

underwent a coronary arterybypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to theleft anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtusemarginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.after surgery the patient was transferred to the intensive careunit in stable condition. on postoperative day #1 the patient wasextubated without incident.on postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrialfibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the150s. the patient was treated with iv lopressor and diltiazem dripat 10 mg/hr. the patient subsequently converted spontaneously tonormal sinus rhythm. postoperatively the patient continued toexperience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from160s to 190s. the patient was started back on lopressor andcaptopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. thepatient was also started back on amlodipine for further bloodpressure control. the patient continued to experience briefepisodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion tonormal sinus rhythm. the patient was followed by her cardiologistpostoperatively , dr. grunow . the patient was started onanticoagulation with coumadin. the patient's atrial fibrillationcontinued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time ofdischarge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greaterthan 24 hours. the patient was seen by physical therapy serviceand it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.the patient is scheduled to be discharged on postoperative day #8to rehabilitation facility in stable condition with all woundsclean and dry.on day of discharge her sodium is 137 , potassium 3.9 , bun 16 ,creatinine 0.9 , glucose 163. wbc 16.7 , hematocrit 31 ,
