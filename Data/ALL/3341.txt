admission date :2010-08-26discharge date :2010-09-02date of birth :1961-06-26sex :mservice :history of present illness :mr. robert mackey is a 49 year old gentleman with a 22 year history of diabetes mellitus .he has a history of peripheral neuropathy , kidney transplantation in 2003 secondary to diabetic nephropathy , as well as throat cancer in 2004 treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation .mr.  mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy ; a cervical mri scan showed very impressive disc herniations at c5-c6 , less so at c4-c5 , with clear cut cord compression , particularly on the right side c5-c6 .therefore , he was admitted for c4-c5 and c5-c6 anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion .physical examination :postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at 97 degrees ; blood pressure 145/80 ; pulse 60 ; respiratory rate 10 ; 100% on a non-rebreather .he was awake , alert , uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site .the wounds were clean , dry and intact , and flat .hospital course :while in the pacu , anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his sao2 dropped to 89% .his respiratory rate was 30 on face mask .interoperatively , he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate , although requiring some neo-synephrine interoperatively .he responded to intravenous lasix with 3.2 liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement .the etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume .no definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia , although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction .he was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully .he was given lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume .he was also put on lopressor 150 mg twice a day .also in the intensive care unit , o2 saturation was closely monitored .the patient became agitated with both tent and bi-pap machine , although continued to saturate well .he was transferred to medicine the morning of 2010-08-30 , for continued medical management post surgery .on the day of transfer , the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium ; thus , a delirium work-up was initiated looking for precipitants .1. when his o2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .2. his non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included temocillin , nortriptyline , haldol , lorazepam , venlafaxine , bupropion , and gabapentin .in addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .3. hypo or hyperglycemia :mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .finger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .4. infectious causes were evaluated .he was febrile in the intensive care unit to 101.0 f. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .a lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .5. mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .a head and neck ct scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .no acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of c2 .this was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .6. trauma was also considered .the patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .throughout his stay , chem-10 was monitored .there were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .liver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .tsh was within normal limits as was b12 and folate .rpr evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .the assay was nonreactive .an eeg was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .on the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-pointrestraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .the restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .later in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .they were taken off two at a time .the patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .intramuscular as well as intravenous haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .each progressive day,  mr. donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .the likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and intensive care unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .other concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .his immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .with this in mind , when obtaining a ct scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .while the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .as for his diabetes mellitus , the mahoney team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .the only other complaints from mr. mackey during his stay were :soreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. tylenol once his delirium had resolved .in addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .this was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .disposition :the patient was discharged on 09-02 .discharge instructions :1. follow-up with dr. williams on tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .2. follow-up with dr. michael , his psychiatrist , on wednesday , 09-08 .3. he was also discharged home with visiting nurse association for physical therapy evaluation of home safety .discharge medications :1. venlafaxine xr 75 mg q. a.m.2. furosemide 20 mg q.o.d.3. metoprolol 100 mg twice a day .4. nitroglycerin sublingual 0.3 mg p.r.n.5. cyclosporin microemulsion .6. neoral 100 mg twice a day .7. zithropren 50 mg q. day .8. prednisone 10 mg q. day .9. minoxidil 10 mg twice a day .10. prilosec 20 mg q. day .11. nph 30 units q. a.m. , 5 to 6 units q. p.m.12. regular insulin 5 units q. a.m. and 3 to 5 units q. p.m.13. wellbutrin 100 mg q. day .14. zocor 60 mg q. day .15. nitroglycerin sr 2.5 mg twice a day .he was instructed to hold the following three medications that he took prior to admission :nortriptyline 10 mg q. h.s. ;
