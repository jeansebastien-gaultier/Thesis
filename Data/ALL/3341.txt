female who is a nun whose admission to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital on the 11th was the first for her .she was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .she was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on mr angiogram .history of present illness :on 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .she was transferred to a facility at atl mil , maryland in oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .she was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .she was then transferred to box memorial hospital nursing home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .she did not reveal any meningismus .the patient was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and referred under the care of dr. telshey peg by dr. rerhea t. hearing of box memorial hospital nursing home .past medical history :includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .past surgical history :includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the ona hospital .apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.cholecystectomy in 1967 .hysterectomy in 1952 .right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .family history :was noncontributory .medications on transfer :included percocet , tenormin , xanax , mevacor and with a history of of calan , ornade and lasix .allergies :there were no known drug allergies .habits :did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .physical examination :on physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .chest was clear .heart had regular rate and rhythm .neck was supple without mass or bruits .the abdomen was soft and nontender .calves were nontender .on neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .she looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .her face was strong and symmetric .she felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .she sees light only od. which is chronic .she reads large print os.her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .she could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .she also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .laboratory data :on admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , mcv 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .a head ct performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .mra / mri revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .hospital course :the patient was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .this revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .this was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .after much discussion , endovascular treatment with gd coils were recommended .the patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .this showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .one coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .it was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .therefore after discussion in detail with sister rora dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .at this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .the patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .discharge diagnosis :subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .procedures :on 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .complications :there were no noted complications .medications on discharge :include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , mom 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 meq. p.o. b.i.d. , dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and czi sliding scale b.i.d.the patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .if the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local m.d. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as glyburide .this may include tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .condition on discharge :stable .follow up :the patient is to follow up with dr. telshey peg .tomedankell wire , m.d. dictating for telshey peg , m.d.tr :th / bmotdd :02-01-92td :02/01/92cc :
