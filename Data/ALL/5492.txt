55 and sbp &lt; 100-          please check ecg postoperatively along with troponin on day 1 and day 4 postoperatively-          please implement high risk dvt prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg sc bid-          please schedule lenis postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positivethank you for this interesting consult. to be staffed today with dr. elliot sexton.__________________________  6/29/2077 9:52 amdaniel e. guzman, m.d.pgy-3, pager 11701
