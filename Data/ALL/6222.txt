a very small pericardial effusion. there is an anterior spacewhich most likely represents a prominent fat pad. compared tothe findings of the prior study of [2165-5-16], left and rightventricular systolic function have deteriorated significantly.brief hospital course:66 year old m with transfusion dependent mds, d+7 s/p allo sct,normal pressure hydrocephalus, cad, htn and diabetes, who wasinitially electively admitted for allo sct with clofarabine,total nodal radiation and anti-thymoglobulin. his course wascomplicated by febrile neutropenia and renal failure.his creatinine was 1.1 on admission and rose to > 5 followingadministration of clofarabine per sct protocol. he developedmetabolic acidosis and worsening confusion over the course ofseveral days leading up to his transplant. on sct day +1, he wasfebrile and started on vancomycin and cefepime. on sct day +3,he was transferred to icu for worsening mental status, increasedrespiratory distress, and renal failure. he remained febrile andwas seen by the id consult team and transitioned to meropenem +levofloxacin + voriconazole. he was intubated electively formultiple procedures including mri, vp shunt tap (byneurosurgery), and bronchoscopy and extubated the following day.he was started on ambisome in place of voriconazole for positivegalactomannan on bal (presumed aspergillosis pneumonia). he wasseen by the neprhology team and started on hd for presumedclofarabine toxicity. mental status improved and he was calledout to the bmt service.however, two days later he was at dialysis when he developed anepisode of altered mental status associated with tachycardia,hypertension and hypoxia to 88% on 2l nc. his respiratory statuscontinued to decline and he was reintubated and transferred tothe icu. in addition, he became hypotensive requiring pressorsfor a few hours; pressors were eventually weaned off, althoughhe then developed shock liver and probable dic requiringmultiple transfusions. due to electrolyte derangements cvvh wasstarted as well.  his abx were broadened to double coveraspergillus (posaconazole+ambisome), vanc was changed to daptofor vre coverage, bactrim was added for pcp [name

the 10s-20s. on evaluation,he was unresponsive and did not have palpable pulses. at thattime, back board was placed beneath patient and cpr wasinitiated. pulseless electrical activity was noted on themonitor at interval 2-minute pulse checks (no shockable rhythm).he received epinephrine 1 mg iv x 2 doses at five minutes apart. housestaff notified the patient's wife, who requested that theresuscitation be stopped. at this time, cpr was stopped and hedid not receive further vasopressors.  he did not regain apulse. the monitor continued to show pulseless electricalactivity for several minutes with slowing heart rate untilasystole. at that time, the patient was examined and was notedto have no audible breath or heart sounds. his pupils were fixedand dilated to ~5mm. there were not signs of life evident. thetime of death was noted to be 3:23 am.  attending physician [last name (namepattern4) ].[first name (stitle) ] was notified of the above events. the patient's wife wasthen
