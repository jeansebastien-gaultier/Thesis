duct. no apparent extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliaryduct dilatation or irregularity is seen. no filling defectsconsistent with stones were noted. as per report, in subsequentimages, biliary stent was successfully placed. impression:successful placement of biliary stent.[2175-8-9] transthoracic echo: the left atrium is moderatelydilated. there is moderate symmetric left ventricularhypertrophy. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. overallleft ventricular systolic function is normal (lvef 70%). tissuedoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular fillingpressure (pcwp>18mmhg). transmitral doppler and tissue velocityimaging are consistent with grade ii (moderate) lv diastolicdysfunction. there is no ventricular septal defect. rightventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. theaortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. the ascendingaorta is moderately dilated. there are three aortic valveleaflets. the aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.there is mild aortic valve stenosis. the mitral valve leafletsare mildly thickened. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.[due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitationmay be significantly underestimated.] there is mild pulmonaryartery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologicpericardial effusion. there are no echocardiographic signs oftamponade.[2175-8-14] ercp findings: comparison is made with ct from [8-12], [2174] and prior ercp from [2175-8-8].  there isremoval of a plastic stent. a retrograde cholangiogram showsmultiple filling defects, some of which likely represent stones,within otherwise normal- appearing biliary tree. a biliary stentwas then placed.brief hospital course:#hypotension/sepsis: on admission, patient met sirs criteriawith fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistentwith sepsis. infectious source was likely biliary tract vs. hdline infection, however also considered was pulmonary source w/new o2 requirements although more likely from capillaryleak/chf. patient has remained fluid responsive intially withoutneed for pressors. the underlying infection was treated with ivvancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at oshgrew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued withappropriate coverage. the patients lactate level, fevers and wbcwere trended and returned to [location 213]. zosyn was switched tociprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash..#mechanical ventilation: patient came to the icu intubated s/percp, on a propofol drip. initially he was hypotensive which wastreated with iv fluids and discontinued propofol, switching tofentanyl/versed for sedation.  shortly thereafter the patientbecame restless, agitated and continued to be hypotensive. hewas given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial lineplacement and foley placement. his labile blood pressures alsoexacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state, making itdifficult to wean off the vent. the initiation of hemodialysiseffectively controlled his bp and fluid status, and on day 7,after his second ercp, he was extubated and started on cpapovernight..# gallstone pancreatitis: on admission the patient had elevatedlfts, pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin and alk phos. his levelsslowly trended down post-ercp except bilirubin and ap, whichcontinued to rise. the patient experienced intermittentepigastric discomfort which prompted a ruq us, which showed afatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised. ctscan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation,cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head.hepatology and ercp were consulted prompting a second-look ercp,which showed sludge drainage in the major papilla, stentmigrated to major papilla and several stones in the cystic duct.the stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and thepatient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended..# esrd: initially the nephrology service felt hd was notappropriate early during admission, in setting of patientbecoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation forpancreatitis. beta-blockers were started however the patient didnot respond and o2 sats started trending down with worseningacidemia and low pao2. the following day hd was initiated withgood response in blood pressure. the patient received hdthroughout his course, with the day before d/c the final time..# hypoxia: suspected capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs.chf as pt with known cad. the patient was weaned off his o2requirement prior to discharge..# drug rash: patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rashon his chest and legs which was pruritic.  dermatology wasconsulted who felt consistent with a drug rash.  offending [doctor last name 360]was felt to be zosyn.  [doctor last name ] was discontinued and rash improved.he will continue hydoxyzine, sarna and fluocinonide..# cad: an echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a causeof fever. this showed extensive calcification of cardiacskeleton, mild calcific aortic stenosis, and no definitevegetations . his ecg had some ischemic changes of unclearduration, and the patient had no active symptoms. cardiacenzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting ofesrd, this was unlikely to be acute event. his aspirin andplavix were continued and the patient remained on telemetry forthe duration of his stay..# osa: witnessed apneic episodes while asleep. known history ofosa on cpap as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent.once patient was extubated he was started on cpap overnight..# anemia: normocytic with normal rdw. unclear baseline. [month (only) 116] below related to esrd (not on epo as outpatient that we know of).d. bili not consistent with hemolysis. hematocrit was trendedand continued to improve with hd and management. renal recs: useepo during hd..medications on admission:fish oil dailysensipar 120mg dailyativan 0.5mg prn (rare)percocet prn (rare)nifedipineer 90 daily (last [8-7])minoxidil-dose unable to verify but pt states rx for 2 tabs andonly takes 1renagel 2400mg tid acphoslo 1334mg (?) tid acsimvastatin 20mg dailyplavix 75mg dailyaspirin 325mg dailytoprolxl 50mg dailydischarge medications:1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. clopidogrel 75 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).3. simvastatin 10 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).4. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hrsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po daily (daily).5. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % lotion sig: one (1) appl topical[hospital1 ] (2 times a day) as needed.disp:1 tube refills:06. ciprofloxacin 750 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a dayfor 5 days: take this at least one hour before you take renagel.disp:5 tablet(s) refills:07. hydroxyzine hcl 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3times a day) as needed for itching: only take this as long asyour rash is itching.disp:21 tablet(s) refills:08. fluocinonide 0.05 % cream sig: one (1) appl topical [hospital1 ] (2times a day) as needed for rash for 12 days: only use while youhave the rash.disp:1 tube refills:09. cinacalcet 30 mg tablet sig: four (4) tablet po daily(daily).10. nifedipine 90 mg tablet sustained release sig: one (1)tablet sustained release po daily (daily).11. minoxidil 2.5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).12. sevelamer hcl 800 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po tidw/meals (3 times a day with meals).13. calcium acetate 667 mg capsule sig: two (2) capsule po tidw/meals (3 times a day with meals).discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:primary diagnoses:biliary sepsisgallstone pancreatitissecondary diagnoses:esrd with hemodialysiscaddrug rashosahtnanemiadischarge condition:good, tolerating regular diet, ambulating with walker fordeconditioning, able to climb a flight of stairs, no oxygenrequirement, vssdischarge instructions:you were seen and treated at the hopital for a blockage in thearea of your gallbladder, which caused you to become infected.you were treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics and ercp(endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) twice. a smalltube called a stent was placed near your gallbladder so that itwill drain bile into your intestine.please take the antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) until it isfinished. you may also use the skin cream for your rash as longas you need it. you may take all of your home medications, andnone of the dosages were changed.call your doctor or come to the emergency department right awayif any of the following problems develop: if you are vomitting and cannot keep in fluids or yourmedications. you are getting dehydrated due to continued vomitting,diarrhea or other reasons.  signs of dehydration include drymouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing. you see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have abowel movement. your skin, or the whites of your eyes become yellow again. your pain is not improving within 8-12 hours or not gonewithin 24 hours.  call or return immediately if your pain isgetting worse or is changing location or moving to your chest orback. you have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 100.4 (f)degrees or 38(c) degrees. any serious change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms thatconcern you.followup instructions:please make an appointment to follow up with your pcp:[name10 (nameis) ],[first name3 (lf) ] [telephone/fax (1) 80088] in the next week or two to furtherevaluate your response to treatment.you will also need to follow-up with the gastroenterology teamto have a repeat ercp 6 weeks with dr.
