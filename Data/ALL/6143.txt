(namepattern2) ] [last name (un) 8773] society guidelines..ecg [8-9]:sinus rhythm. occasional ventricular premature beats. comparedto the previoustracing of [2130-8-8] no definite change.brief hospital course:this 74-year-old male was initially admitted following anepisode of collapse while at a casino. it is unclear whetherthis was a cardiac arrest but after 5 minutes of cpr there wasevidence of a pulse and aed showed a viable rhythm with no shockadvised. he was never defibrillated. during his fall, he hit hishead and sustained a minor laceration to his forehead. at theosh he was intubated and cooled as per protocol and loaded withphenytoin for ? seizures, a ct-head showed only small vesseldisease with no acute changes. in addition, ct-[md number(3) 85050] oshshowed no evidence of pe and a borderline dilation of the aorta.ecg showed af in 120s. he was tehn transported via [location (un) ] toteh [hospital1 18] ed and was given a stat dose of pip/tazo 4.5g iv forlul infiltrates present on cxr, was loaded with aspirin 325mgand clopidogrel 300mg, commenced on a heparin infusion andmetoprolol was started. at this point ecg shoewd af/a-flutter w/2:1 block and he was transferred to the ccu. initial cardiacenzymes were tnt 0.44 ck-mb 26. and treatment for possiblepneumonia was continued. he was cooled for 24-hours and therewas no evidence of seizure activity on eeg following neurologyreview. an echo performed in the context of cooling showed amildly dilated la and severe biventricular systolic dysfunctionwith lvef <20%. when paralytics were weaned, mr [known lastname ] was seento be shaking and tehre was no eeg correlate to suggestseizures. he was weaned off ventilatory supportand cxr showedresolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. continued eegmonitoring was discontinued and neurology were happy that therewas no evidence of seizures. he was extubated on [2130-8-1] andwas neurologically appropriate. he required iv hydralazine forlabile bp and his metoprolol was up-titrated. his hb also wasnoted to trend down and although stool was guaiac -ve it wasgastroccult +ve and pepcid was changed to ppi. klebsiella wasgrown on sputum from [2130-8-2] and iv ceftiaxone was started. hewas weaned off the ng tube and by [8-4] passed swallow assessmentand was able to eat and drink. he had mild pulmonary edemarequiring iv furosemide. labetalol iv was titrated to bp andweaned. he complained of rib pain and a ct-chest showedbilateral psoas hematomas and minimally displaced rib fractureson 3rd to 11th ribs on r and 3rd to 6th ribs on the left. thisalso demonstrated bilateral renal cysts including the largest onthe r which was more solid measuring 34x36mm and suggested o/pu/s to visualise. in addition there was evidence of bilateralpleural effusions and a 4mm l upper lobe pulmonary nodule whichshould be followed up with a repeat ct in 1 year. hesubsequently developed delirium which required prn haloperidoland there was no recurrence of his af. he pulled out his urinarycatheter on [2130-8-7] and failed trial without catheterresulting in replacement. a repeat echo on [2130-8-7] was muchimproved with mild regional left ventricular systolicdysfunction with hypokinesis/dysnnchrony of the inferior andinferiolateral walls and lvef 45-50%. due to a rising wbc of 14and positive urinalysis he was commenced on oral ciprofloxacinfor a presumed uti. there was evidence of a mild r carotid buitand carotid u/s demonstrated  mild bilateral disease. he wascommence on amiodarone and warfarin and ecg showed persistent srand pvcs. his confusion improved and he had a trial withoutcatheter on [8-11] which was successful and was transferred torehab.# neurological ?????? mr [known lastname ] was thought initially to bepotentially having seizures and was loaded with phenytoinalthough there was no eeg evidence of this. on neurology review,they were happy that he was not having seizures and one episodeof shaking post weaning sedation was felt to represent rigors.following extubation, mr [known lastname ] improved well neurologicallyalthough he developed a delirium picture which was presumedlikely secondary to acute illness. head ct at the outsidehospital showed no acute changes and although urinalysis x1 waspositive, there has been no growth on urine culture. he also hadurinary retention and the feeling was that this is likelycontributing, as patient??????s mental status significantly improvedafter foley was placed. patient completed course of ceftriaxoneafter sputum culture positive for klebsiella and ct showedatelectasis but no frank consolidation, in addition patient hasno clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia. haloperidol wasused prn and he required minimal doses. on discharge he was onlyvery mildly confused and generally oriented..#. cardiac arrest: mr [known lastname ] had a collapse while standing at acasino where he had 5 minutes of cpr and aed showed no shockablerhythm. it is unknown if pt was truly pulseless or merelyunresponsive. he was cooled as per protocol and although initialecho while cooled showed a depressed ef <20%, post-rewarming,this had increased to 40-45% which is very reassuring. cardiacenzymes peaked at 0.44 on admission and have trended down since.no shocks were given throughout course. only documented rhythmswere afib/a-flutter, although has latterly been in sinus. he wasgiven a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel and has beencontinued on these. he was commenced on warfarin and will beslowly increased with inr as of [8-11] 1.3..#htn: very good bp control latterly although required ivlabetalol/hydralazine as above for labile bp. we will continueon hctz, lisinopril and toprol..# afib/a-flutter. on presentation to [hospital1 18] mr [known lastname ] was foundto be in af/a-flutter and this has not persisted he was startedon amiodarone [8-9] and warfarin was loaded although his inrslatterly have been low and he will likely need an increaseddose. he need close inr monitoring and we are aiming for a goalrange inr [3-1]. we will continue toprol xl. on discharge he wasin sr with pvcs..# new carotid bruit noted - a new right carotid bruit was notedon [8-7] and carotid series revealed minimal bilateral icaplaque, with no appreciable stenosis (graded as less than 40%)and therefore there is no need for intervention at this time.# rib/hip pain: pt is s/p cpr and continues to have pain inhip/lower abdominal area. ct scan shows psoas hematomas whichmay be contributing to pain and multiple minimally displacedbilateral rib fractures. mr [known lastname ] pain has been improving..# new ct-findings. on ct-c/a/p there was evidence of bilateralrenal cysts, the largest on the r which was more solid measuring34x36mm and suggested o/p u/s to which should be arranged. inaddition there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and a4mm l upper lobe pulmonary nodule which should be followed upwith a repeat ct in 1 year given his smoking history..#anemia ?????? mr [known lastname ] was noted to have a small drop in hct andthis was trended and now stable. it is unclear whether this maybe due to poor nutritional state and freq phlebotomy althoughguaiac stool was -ve, there was positive guiaic of gastriccontents while intubated. he has now been started on a ppi whichhas been increased to [hospital1 ]. of note he was rrecently treated forh pylori according to wife so this may also be contributing..# leukocytosis: mr [known lastname ] had pulmonary infiltrates on cxr andwas treated initially with a stat dose of pip/tazo and latterlyceftriaxone when cultures of sputum grew klebsiella. he hadpreviously had low grade temps and has now been apyrexial. mostrecently cxr showed atelectasis with no frank consolidation. allfurther cultures and bcs have been negative. he was started onciprofloxacin for ? uti when urinalysis was positive..# urinary retention: pt pulled out foley catheter and subsequentto re-insertion had urinary retention which resolves. he wasvoiding post trial without catheter on [8-11] although if he doesgo back into retention he will clearly need furthercatheterisation and urology follow-up. he was commenced ontamsulosin..# dyslipidemia: continue high dose statinmedications on admission:lisinopril 5mg qdprevastatin 80mg qdvitamin d unknown dosedischarge medications:1.

collapsed and received cpr on [2130-7-28]. it is unclear if yourheart stopped but you did not receive a shock that we know of.some ribs were cracked during the cpr. you had a small heartattack during this episode. we treated you for a pneumonia withintravenous antibiotics. you also developed a blood collectionin your pelvis from the blood thinners, this is getting better.your blood count is low because of the pelvic bleeding and somebleeding in your bowels. you could not urinate after we took thefoley catheter out of your bladder so we replaced it and startedyou on a medicine called flomax
