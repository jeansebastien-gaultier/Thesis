's .she subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .she had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was o.k.her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .in 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by dr. times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .she had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .she , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .dr. avejoh wierst at the pedines community hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .a tee showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the bri health for further evaluation .hospital course :on examination here , i could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .the observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .this was on diltiazem and digoxin .at the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .we could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .she also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .a cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .it showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .the graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .the left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .there was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .the mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .with this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .a permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .this was an intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the vvi mode with an escape rate of 65 .she tolerated the procedure well .on diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qd , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .on this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .we will ambulate her over the next couple of days .we have stopped her lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .if she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by dr. avejoh wierst and dr. em neighburce .em z. times , m.d.tr :enp / bmotdd :5/9/92td :05/12/92cc :for the patient , at dalee , alaska , for dr. avejoh wierst , c / o pedines community hospital , in stumphi road , biinss , south dakota 59762 .
