co2 retentionrequiring bipap. pt was called out to the floor and did well forseveral days.  he was then noted to be hypoxic at dialysis.  healso underwent therapeutic thoracentesis on right side with goodrelief.  the following morning, he was found to be somnolentwith myoclonic jerking.  abg demonstrated 7.24/70/89 on 3 l/min. he was transferred back to the micu for ? bipap.  he was notedto be continually hypercarbic throughout his admission.pt's bps continued to drop and he became unable to tolerate hd.on the day prior to death, dialysis had to be stoppedprematurely (removed 2.2l) due to hypoxia and hypotension.  themorning of his death, he was noted to be acutely hypoxic andhypercarbic.  cxr revealed a collapsed left lung and increase inright sided pleural effusion.  discussed situation with familyand it was decided to not escalate care (had been decided uponto make him dnr/dni the night before).  over the course of theday, he became increasinly hypoxic, hypercarbic, acidotic, andhypotensive.  he was pronounced deat at 17:25 on [2133-8-25].family was present and declined autopsy..#.  dyspnea:  patient presented from rehab with acute dyspneaand sob with walking the day of admission likley from increasingpleural effusions. patient had been afebrile, withoutleukocytosis, bandemia or cough making pna very unlikely. giventhat ctx/levaquin/vanco started in the ed were d/ced. nephrologywas notified that the patient was admitted and pt was sent to hdfor ultrafiltration on the day of transfer off of the micu. ceswere negative.#. end stage renal disease:  patient on mwf hd treatments. ptcontinued hd as an in patient with removal of excess fluid.#. c diff colitis: patient with (+) c diff tox x 3 duringadmission in [month (only) 205].  on vanco at [hospital 100] rehab until [2133-8-24].vanco 250mg po qid was continued as an in patient.#. diastolic heart failure: last echo [2133-7-17] with ef >55% andmild mitral regurgitation. hd was done as above.#. atrial fibrillation: patient is currently v-paced. wecontinued outpatient amiodarone. anticoagulation was held givenrecent history of gi bleed.#. thrombocytopenia: thought to be [1-31] to drug reaction onemonth ago (ppi), currently at 61, down from 113 at lastadmisstion. this suggests the possibility of mds. follow up witha hematologist may be indicate in the future as an outpatient,but since the remainder of his counts are wnl no h/o consult wascalled.medications on admission:amiodarone 200mg dailycalcium gluconate 650mg tidmidodrine 5mg tidsimethicone 80mg [hospital1 ]vanco 250mg po qidvit b/vit c/folic aciddischarge medications:expireddischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:expireddischarge condition:expireddischarge instructions:expiredfollowup instructions:expiredcompleted by:[2133-8-25]
