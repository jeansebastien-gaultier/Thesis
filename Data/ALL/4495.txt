record date: 2164-08-24			cardiology						northland medical clinic						reason for visit:   follow up of cad s/p cabg adn multiple cv risk factors			interval history:   a 74 yo man with a long history of cad eventually necessitating cabg in 4/2161.  he has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.his last cv evaluation was an adenosine pet in 4/63 which showed an ef 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.  these are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  his last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his om and to his rca and a patent but atretic lima.  he has an occluded rca, an 80% om, and a 60% lad in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via om collaterals).  he was admitted to fahey center in may with syncope associated with bradycardia.  his atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  he does have a long-standing trifasicular block.he denies any chest pain, orthopnea, pnd, lee, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.someone started him on niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.			past medical history:   cad with cabg in 4/61, lima to lad, v to rca plvb, v to om  -- he has an unbypassed occluded diagonal with collaterals from the omdressler'shtnlipidsdmneuropathyfrozen shouldergerdtias 2153 and 12/2160bladder cas/p turp			medications (confirmed):			aspirincoreg 3.125mg po qddiovaninsulin syringesklor con 10meq po qdlasix 40mg po qdneurontin 300 mg po tidnexium 40mg po qdnph insulin 48units sc qamonetouch stripspravachol 20mg po qdregular insulin sczetia 10mg po qdallergies:			drug allergy   vioxx.  zestril, gives a cough.penicillin allergy   penicillin.			family history:   mother died at 67, had mi in her 50sfather died in his 80s, had dm and pvd			social history:   married.  retired sales specialist.  paints and enjoys model trains.quit smoking 2152.  no etoh.			review of systems:   as above.  also some memory lapses.  he has some productive cough, but no change from prior.  otherwise negative in detail.physical examination:			-pulse: 62  -general:   no acute distress.-skin:   no rashes, anicteric.-neck:   carotids 2+ without bruits. jvp 7 no jugular venous distention.-chest:   clear to auscultation and percussion.-cardiac:   left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. regular rate and rhythm, normal s1 and s2, with no s3 or s4. there were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.-abdomen:   normal bowel sounds, soft and nontender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.-extremities:   no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.-bp: 152/66  -resp. rate: 12  -weight: 216  lbs.-heent:   unremarkable			ekg:   nsr with trifasicular block. cr c/w copd.compared to 9/63, hr has increased.selected recent labs:			 metabolicdate     k        cre      07/29/64 3.8      1.1      lipid/thyroiddate     chol     trig     hdl      ldl      07/20/64 125      118      42       59       						assessment and plan:   a 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and cv risk factors associated with cad and mild lv dysfunction.  his chest pain syndromes have resolved.  he has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  this was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.cv risk factor modification remains our primary focus.plan.1. cad-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  he needs an arb, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (i gave samples and a rx).2. lv dysfunction--we will check a gbps for ef.3. dm-followed by dr. orton.  continue to aim for an a1c of 7.04. carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so i don't think any intervention will be necessary.  continue to rx risk factors.5. lipids-look great today.  continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, i suspect he will give up the niaspan soon!  we will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.6. htn--home bps have been higher too on coreg.  i am trying to get him on an arb again.  diovan at 80 a day. he will get f/u labs in one monthf/u 6monthschanges to medications this visit			regular insulin   sc  14u qam and 14u qpm qty:1 refills:6 start: 11/25/2160nph insulin 48units  sc qam 16 units qpm qty:3month supply refills:5 start: 10/20/2153diovan 80mg  po qd qty:90 refills:3 start: 08/24/2164coreg 3.125mg  po bid qty:30 refills:5 start: 06/16/2164zetia 10mg  po qd qty:90 refills:3 start: 10/25/2162nexium 40mg  po qd qty:30 refills:3 start: 08/18/2164klor con 10meq  po qd take with food; do not chew tabs qty:90 refills:3 start: 04/11/2161lasix 40mg  po qd qty:30 refills:1yr start: 07/28/2161aspirin 325 mg  po qd qty:90 refills:3pravachol 20mg  po qd qty:30 refills:5 start: 05/25/2161neurontin 300 mg  po tid qty:90 refills:11 start: 05/25/2161onetouch strips     use 5xday #200 with 1 yearinsulin syringes     bd u-100 1cc #100 w/11 refills			dx tests ordered:   gbpsbmp in one month			cc:   dr. barbara chavez			signed electronically by   riley l overby md  on  aug 24, 2164
