however , the patient has nothad any further hemoptysis since then ( approximately 20 hours ).past medical history: 1. status post cardiac transplantation in1991 ( secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy ).2. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 3. status post coronaryartery bypass graft. 4. status post a left ventral hernia repair.5. status post a right ankle fracture. 6. status post goring bybull in 1987. 7. liver laceration. 8. hypertension. 9. peripheralvascular disease.admission medications: 1. cyclosporine 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. 2.cardizem cd 180 mg p.o. q.day. 3. imuran175 mg p.o. q.h.s.allergies: no known drug allergies.social history: the patient lives with his wife in jo the patient was a janitor until 1/19 thepatient smoked a half pack per day times 30 years. the patientdrinks only socially ( occasionally ).family history: father died of a myocardial infarction at age 78.mother alive , but has diabetes mellitus ,congestive heart failure , and coronary artery disease.physical examination: on vitals , temperature was 97.9 , bloodpressure 160/100 , heart rate 106 ,respirations 20 , and o2 saturation 96% on two liters. the patientis an elderly gentleman lying in his bed in no acute distress.heent examination was normocephalic , atraumatic. pupils wereequal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation. extraocularmuscles were intact. there was no lymphadenopathy. jvp wasapproximately 7 cm , with no carotid bruits. cardiac examinationrevealed a regular rate and rhythm , normal s1 , s2 , no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. abdomen had positive bowel sounds , obese ,nontender , and nondistended. extremities had 2+ bilateral lowerextremity edema. neurological examination was grossly nonfocal.laboratory data: sma-7 was notable for glucose 284 , creatinine1.2. cbc revealed a white count of 4 , hematocrit35.2 , and platelets 191 , 000. pt was 13 , ptt 28.2.hospital course: the patient had no hemoptysis throughout hismo hospital hospitalization.the patient was scheduled for , and underwent , bronchoscopy on4/3/96 , which revealed bronchiectasis of the anterior segment ofthe left lower lobe ( where the ct abnormalities were seen ).purulent secretions were also encountered and sent for appropriatecultures and tests. no evidence of malignancy was seen. thepulmonary team did recommend starting the patient on appropriateantimicrobial coverage for mai. therefore , the patient was startedon clarithromycin and ethambutol. given that these medicationseffect the liver cytochrome p450 system , the patient's cyclosporine doserequired adjustment downward to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to keep his levels200-300. the patient also underwent ct scan of his maxillofacialarea on 9/12/96. this scan revealed air levels in both maxillarysinuses , as well as the sphenoid sinuses. subtotal opacificationwas seen in most of the ethmoid air cells. also , subtotalopacification of the mastoid air cells was demonstratedbilaterally. the frontal sinuses appeared minimally developed; ofthe few air cells present , there was complete opacification. theoverall impression was pain and sinus disease with leftotomastoiditis. the patient underwent further evaluation in theent clinic on 7/24/96 ; their recommendations included biaxin timesfour weeks ( the patient will be on this medication for at leastfour weeks for coverage of mai ). the infectious disease teamrecommends that the patient's repeat afbs be followed up and , ifthey are followed up , clarithromycin and ethambutol could bestopped after six weeks versus 18-24 months of therapy. thepulmonary team also recommended that the patient be started onalbuterol and atrovent inhalers and have a set of pulmonaryfunction tests obtained as an outpatient. it is also recommendedthat the patient be started on a cholesterol lowering agent at hisnext transplant clinic visit ( ldl came back at 151 after patient'sdischarge ).discharge medications: procardia xl 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. ,cyclosporine 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , ethambutol1 , 500 mg p.o. q.day , atrovent metered dose inhaler two puffsq.i.d. , imuran 175 mg p.o. q.h.s. , clarithromycin 500 mg p.o.b.i.d. , afrin two sprays n.a. b.i.d. times three days , and oceanspray two sprays n.a. q.day.condition: fair.disposition: to home , follow up appointment in the transplantclinic on 8/26/96 ;
