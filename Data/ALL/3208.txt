diagnosis: coronary artery disease status post coronaryartery bypass graft , right sided carotidendarterectomy , and post-operative atrialfibrillation.history of present illness: patient was admitted january , 1996with a history of one to two months ofstable exertional angina which became crescendo angina and anexercise stress test , thallium , revealed multivessel disease.past medical/surgical history: significant for coronary arterybypass grafting on january ,1996 , right carotid endarterectomy on january , 1996 , he had somepost-operative atrial fibrillation/flutter as above , he was statuspost a myocardial infarction , he had a history of hypertension ,insulin dependent diabetes times three years , and gout.allergies: he had no known drug allergies.social history: included an eight pack year tobacco history whichhe quit approximately thirty years ago and hedrank alcohol socially.family history: negative for coronary artery disease andquestionable for diabetes mellitus.physical examination: he was a well-developed , well-nourishedwhite man in no apparent distress. ontransfer to medicine , his vital signs were a temperature of 98.8 ,heart rate of 140 in atrial flutter , blood pressure 150/70 , andbreathing at 18 with a room air saturation of 94%. heent:examination showed his extraocular muscles intact , pupils equal ,round , and reactive to light , his right carotid endarterectomy hadsteri-strips , his left carotid pulse was 2+ without bruit , he hadno lymphadenopathy , and his oropharynx was benign. lungs: clearbilaterally. cardiac: examination revealed a regular rate andrhythm and he was tachycardic without a murmur. abdomen:examination showed that bowel sounds were present and it wasbenign. extremities: examination showed no clubbing , cyanosis , oredema , posterior tibial pulses were 2+/2+ , and his dorsalis pedispulses were trace bilaterally. neurological: examination showedthat he was alert and oriented times three and grossly non-focal.laboratory examination: significant for a normal sma 7 , cbc whichhad a white count of 3.7 , a hematocrit of33.8 with 407 platelets , a sedimentation rate was 48 , his digoxinlevel on transfer was 1.3 , his procainamide level was 2.6 , and hisnapa was 1.1 on transfer. an ekg showed atrial flutter at 140.hospital course: he underwent cardiac catheterization on august , 1996 which revealed a left dominant systemwith left anterior descending with serial 60% complex lesions , midleft anterior descending 70% lesion , and a ramus 40% lesion. theleft circumflex was totally occluded proximally and the rightcoronary artery was small with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. leftventriculogram revealed normal systolic function. on june ,1996 , he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery with alima to his left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to hisom1 , and a saphenous vein graft to his om2. on march , 1996 ,he developed atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 180 range ,blood pressure 160/90 , he complained of palpitations , and wasdiaphoretic. he received lopressor 5 mg intravenously times two ,his blood pressure responded with decrease to 120/72 , and his heartrate remained in the 140 range with atrial fibrillation. heconverted to normal sinus rhythm in the eighties. he was loadedwith digoxin and maintained on lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. thatevening , he had a second episode of atrial fibrillation. onjanuary , 1996 , he underwent right carotid endarterectomy for anasymptomatic 90% stenosis. in the pacu , he had atrial fibrillationin the 150 range with decreased blood pressure to the seventies.on january , 1996 , he had another episode of atrial fibrillationlasting approximately thirty minutes which converted to normalsinus rhythm with 5 mg of lopressor. on march , 1996 , heconverted into atrial fibrillation at approximately 4 a.m. and hisblood pressure was 160/100 , his heart rate was approximately in the130 range , and carotid sinus pressure produced no change in hisrate. an ecg revealed a supraventricular tachycardia at 130 beatsper minute , likely atrial flutter , with 2:1 conduction. verapamil5 mg q.5 minutes times two intravenously resulted in a heart ratedrop from 120 to 70 which revealed atrial flutter. at this point ,he was transferred to medicine for further management. hismedications on transfer included magnesium and potassium slidingscale , axid 150 p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d. , percocet one to two tabletsp.r.n. , zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , insulin sliding scale , benadrylp.r.n. , lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d. , procansr 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. started on january , 1996 , and metamucilp.r.n. post-transfer , he was maintained on his cardiac regimenovernight. he remained in atrial flutter throughout the night , wasslight diaphoretic but had no other associated symptoms. he wascardioverted electrically on june , 1996 into normal sinusrhythm with a heart rate in the seventies to nineties.disposition: he is discharged on july , 1996 aftercardioversion in stable condition.discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , lopressor 50 mgp.o. b.i.d. , percocet one to two tablets q.3-4h. p.r.n. , procan sr750 mg p.o. q.i.d. , and zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.follow-up: he has follow-up appointments with dr. musantedictated by: kenton delmer lucius , m.d. eq45attending: isidro guy , m.d. gt91vl718/2575batch: 73733 index
