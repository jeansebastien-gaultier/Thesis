after transfer from osh following awitnessed syncopal episode. head ct performed showing diffusesah. cta of head also performed with preliminarily identified ananeurysm at the left ica bifurcation. she was loaded withdilantin, and started on nimodipine, and emergent bedsideexternal ventricular drain was placed. she also had a cardiacecho done for concerns of a catacholamine inducedcardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showedsignificantly depressed cardic function. she was placed on a[last name (un) 18821] monitor to more closely monitor for this. she had anangiogram done on [6-4], when the left distal ica aneurysm wascoiled. she then returned to the icu postoperatively.on [6-5](overnight) she had a icp elevation to 50 and the drainwas promplty dropped to 10cm, and icp normalized. emergent headct was done which showed likely evolving brifrontalhypoattenuations/possible stroke. she again returned to angio on[6-6] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new ctfinding.the patient was febrile with a tmax 101.6 and was pancultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were bothneagtive. on [6-6] the dobutamine intravenous drip was off,vasopressors levophed and neo cont.  the nimodipine cut in [12-21]to maintain goal blood pressures. the patient was brought toangio, there was no significant spasm and given 5mgverapamil-aneurysm stable.  blood cultures were found to benegative.  the sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.on[6-7]: the patient had an acute pao2 decrease to 50%.  there wasa concern for pulmonary emboluse.  the cta of the chest was notconsistent with pulmonary embolus. the ct head was unchanged.the patient was moniotored for possible central diabetesinsipidus. the urine and sputum cultures were both negative. on[6-8],  the patient was pan-cultured for a fever to 102. a headct ordered for elevated icp to 44, mannitol was initiated forincreased icps. a cta was performed which was consistent with aslight decrease in intercranial vasospasm. on [6-9], the patientrequired 3 doses of mannitol for sustained icp levels of 23.there were no changes in the patients mental status with theseicp increases.on exam the patient was intermitently followingcommands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremitymoved to command, the left lower extremity and right upperextremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open andtracked with her eyes. on [6-10], the patient was back on adobutamine gtt continuously to maintain a goal blood pressure,the patient had a tee which was consistent with ejection f of20%. the lenis were negative for deep vein thrombosis, the csfand sputum cultures were negative. on [6-11], the patientunderwent an angio which was consistent with mild to modvasospasm.  she recieved 2 doses of verapamil.nimodipine at 15mgevery 2 hours was restarted. on [6-12], the patient was bolusedwith dilantin 300mg for a 7.9 level.  the head ct was repeatedand was stable. the patient was extubated and stopped nimodpinefor systolic blood pressure in 60's.the goal map > 100 anddobutamine was restarted.[6-14] ct shows:new stroke in the posterior left mca distributioncta shows diffuse, severe vasospasm involving the bilateral mcas(left worse than right)the following day she underwent acerebral angiogram which showed mild to moderate spasm left a1,2and m1,2 segments though her exam seemed to slightly improvewith brisk localization on lue and localization on rue thoughnot as brisk as left. she had some intermittent eye opening. astroke neurology consult was obtained and they agreed with ourcontinued hhh management and requested starting a statin.on [6-17], she was again febrile, and pan cultured. cvlaccess was changed and catheter tip sent. or was cancelled forthe day for her temperature, and possibly to re-attempt [6-19] or[6-20] if afebrile and no positive cultures. positive blood cx fromarterial line and appearance of axillary a line, concerned forline infection and she was treated for line associatedbacteremia for 7 day course.  peg placed by surgery team on[2165-6-26] without event.   meds and diet were advanced through pegas recommended without issue.on discharge her neurological exam she preferred her eyes closedwould open to voice, questionable following commands  with leftside. she is essentially plegic on right side but will withdrawboth arm and leg to pain. her pupils are 4mm and reactive, herincision are well healed. she was tolerating her tube feedswithout difficulty. speech and swallow recommends video swallowbefore initiating any oral feeds.medications on admission:unknowndischarge medications:1. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q6h (every 6hours) as needed for fevers.2. bisacodyl 5
