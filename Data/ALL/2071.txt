history ofdiabetes , end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis with a recentav graft infection , sepsis , thoracic cord compression status postfusion secondary to mrsa osteomyelitis , recurrent c. difficile infections ,life-threatening epistaxis , who was status post embolization , whois now admitted to the renal service with suspected fungemiathought to be associated with her tunneled catheter. thepatient , however , is asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.1.. infectious disease: the patient had a positive bloodculture identified on surveillance blood cultures. the patientwas initially started on micafungin iv while speciation andsensitivities were pending. the patient received five days ofmicafungin iv 100 mg iv daily. cultures then came back withcandida glabrata that was sensitive to fluconazole. at thattime , she was converted over to oral fluconazole 400 mg oncedaily. surveillance blood cultures with fungal isolators weresent on a daily basis while in the hospital , all of which have come backnegative to date. the patient also had her tunneled catheter line pulled on10/13/07 .  she was evaluated by ophthalmology to rule outendophthalmitis and was determined not to have evidence of this.she also received a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule outvegetation. the patient has a history of mrsa osteomyelitis witha cord compression status post decompression with hardware andwas continued on levofloxacin and iv vancomycin which wasscheduled to continue until 9/26/07 .  blood cultures from3/15/07 grew out vre bacteremia , and the patient was at thattime converted from iv vancomycin to linezolid 600 mg orallytwice daily on 6/12/07 .  she also received one dose ofgentamicin 80 mg iv x1. a new tunneled catheter had been placedon 11/22/07 and given that the blood cultures was vre grew backpositive on 3/15/07 , it was certain that the new tunneledcatheter was not the source of vre and the decision was made to treatthrough the line. all subsequent blood cultures from 6/12/07and 8/14/07 are all negative to date. the patient had onetemperature spike to 101 degrees , and she was recultured of thesecultures which were negative. she also had a repeat chest x-raywhich showed only minimal atelectasis and no evidence ofpneumonia. the patient subsequently defervesced. and has been afebrile forover 72 hours. also , of note ,the patient had a history of c. difficile. she was continued on oralvancomycin for suppression. she did continue to have numerousloose stools during the hospitalization and c. difficile cultureswere sent twice on 2/2/07 and again on 11/22/07 , both of whichwere negative. also , of note , the patient has sacral decubitusulcer that was watched closely for infection.2. renal: as noted above , the patient's tunneled catheter wasremoved as it was deemed the most likely source of her fungemia.she was dialyzed once through her temporary femoral line andtunneled catheter was then placed on 11/22/07 and the patient wasdialyzed approximately every two days with the last dialysis on11/11/07 .  the patient is due for hemodialysis on 4/28/07 . 3. heme: the patient has a history of anemia that is consistentwith chronic disease. she received 1 unit of packed red cellsduring her hospitalization.4. gastrointestinal: the patient , on admission , had right upperquadrant tenderness with an elevated alkaline phosphatase andggt. a right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained and to ruleout biliary obstruction. this study showed a normal liver. agallbladder with a few small stones as well as sludge ,gallbladder wall thickness was normal. there was no sonographicmurphy's sign , and biliary tree was noted to have a dilatedcommon bile duct of 7 mm that was unchanged and distal ducts werenot well seen. the intrahepatic ducts were noted to be normal.the patient's zocor , however , was held in the setting of elevatedlfts. abdominal pain resolved on hospital day 2 and lfts trended to normal.also , of note , the patient had a history of c. difficileas noted above. she continued to have diarrhea although her c.difficile cultures were negative. she was treatedsymptomatically with lomotil. a rectal tube was also placedgiven her diarrhea and increased pain with soiling of ulcer as well as risk ofinfection. rectal tube should be continued in rehab to preventinfection of the sacral ulcers.5. cardiovascular: the patient has a history of paroxysmalatrial fibrillation with rvr and was continued on her lopressor ,amiodarone. she did not have any episodes of rapid ventricularrate , nor any episodes of hemodynamic instability orhypertension.6. neuro: the patient has bilateral lower extremity weaknessand loss of sensation of the right lower extremity likelysequelae of recent cord compression , per neuro notes in themedical record from 7/3/06 .  the patient also had an episode ofacute delirium. as a result , her reglan was discontinued as washer fentanyl patch and her mental status improved although shestill had baseline memory deficits. psychiatry was consulted andrecommended tapering her celexa and cymbalta in the setting ofwaxing and waning mental status. the patient has also beencounseled to avoid oxycodone or any other narcotics for paincontrol and to try to only use tylenol.7. derm: the patient has a sacral as well as right heeldecubitus ulcer. the wound nurse was consulted , and the patientreceived panafil ointment to the sacral ulcers twice daily.sacral wound is to be irrigated with warm saline and then panafilis to be applied to open areas twice daily , and then wound is tobe dressed with dry sterile dressing , all twice a day. thepatient has sutures in place from thoracic spinal fusion.orthopedics was consulted to remove some of the sutures.approximately , 50% of the sutures , however , were not ready tocome out , and the patient should follow up with dr. hans v cumoletti on 1/4/07 for removal of the remaining sutures. thisarea should be evaluated at least daily and dressings changedonce daily with dry sterile dressings.8. vascular: the patient was noted to have oozing at the siteof her old av graft and the right antecubital fossa on 10/7 .  vascularsurgery was consulted and evacuated a hematoma on 10/7 .  this wound is to bedressed with 2 x 2s , soaked to normal saline and is to be changedthree times daily. the patient is to follow up with dr. daron t pogar from vascular surgery in two weeks to evaluate this woundsite.9. psychiatry: the patient had a flat affect and was thought tobe appropriately depressed in past hospitalizations. she wasinitially continued on cymbalta and celexa. psychiatry wasconsulted and felt that the patient was demonstrating somedelirium , but she was currently not depressed and recommended thather cymbalta and celexa be tapered. she is currently in theprocess of being tapered , and this taper should continue as notedin the discharge medication section.10. pain: the patient was initially treated with fentanyl andoxycodone per rehabilitation regimen. her fentanyl patch wasquickly discontinued in the setting of one episode of acutedelirium. her oxycodone was continued and she requiredapproximately 10 mg of oxycodone daily. she , however , has beencounseled to try to wean herself off of oxycodone , and use onlytylenol for pain given propensity to delirium.11. heent: the patient had a history of severe epistaxis. she ,however , has not had any epistaxis during this admission. shewas continued on saline nasal sprays.12. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: the patient was seenby nutrition consultants. her zinc and vitamin c werediscontinued to avoid copper deficiency. she was started onmegace 400 mg twice daily , and she was placed on a liberal dietto encourage p.o. intake. the patient required some electrolyterepletion including repletion of phosphate and potassium. ofnote , phosphate should not be repleted with neutrophos but withsodium phosphate for phosphates less than 1.5 possiblygiven the potassium load and neutrophos. at time of discharge however patientdid not have iv acess. patient should recieve one dose of neutraphos 1 packetx1 upon arrival to rehab. she should then have a basic metabolic panel checkedon 5/30/07 to ensure her potassium is normal.13. prophylaxis: the patient was continued on subcutaneousheparin as well as a
