(lf) 1835]chief complaint:s/p unwittnessed fallmajor surgical or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:78 year old woman who takes plavix and aspirin daily and fell[4-2] at her daughter's home. the patient is intubated and noncommunicative at the time of initial exam.  her daughter andhealth care proxy is able to relay the events from the time ofthe patients fall at 430 pm [4-2]. her daughter reports that shewas in another room when her mother fell.  the daughter heardher mother fall and went immediately to her side. the patienttripped on the last stair of her home. there was no observedloss of consciousness and the patient stated at the time of thefall that she lost her footing on the steps.  at baseline, thepatient has difficulty with her knees that caused herunsteadiness.  the patient had a left eyebrow laceration fromthe fall, but was completely neurologically intact per thedaughter. the daughter took the patient to [name (ni) 620] [name (ni) ] . at 7pmthe pt became aphasic and lethargic and had a head ct whichshowed a large left intraparenchymal bleed.  the patient waselectively intubated and transferred to [hospital1 18] ed for definitivecare.past medical

[4-5]:findings: as compared to the previous examination, thepre-existing leftlower lung opacity has slightly increased in density and evolvestowards aretrocardiac consolidation. the pre-existing left lower lobeopacity is ofsimilar density but slightly more extensive, the changes couldbe consistent with bilateral evolving aspiration pneumonia.  thesize of the cardiac silhouette is slightly increased. there isno evidence of fluid overload. the monitoring and supportdevices are unchanged. no evidence of larger pleural effusions.brief hospital course:patient was admitted to [hospital1 18] after transfer from osh withsignificantly sized intracranial hemorrhage while onanticoagulation therapy from previous cardiac surgery. uponadmission; she was administered platelets and admitted to theintensive care unit for continuous monitoring. on [4-3], repeathead ct was performed and determined to be stable, and notindicitative of ongoing hemorrhage. she was subsequentlyextubated. on [4-4], she was observed to have difficulty managingher secretions, and an arterial blood gas was performed andrevealed a pao2 in the 50s, and was reintubated. head ct wasagain performed to evaluate whether the ich had evolved toattribute to the poor respiratory effort, but was stable. on[4-5], a bedside mini bronchoscopy was done to evaluate if shehad aspirated any secretions during her period of poorrespiratory effort. a lung consolidation was identified, andantibiotics were started. on [4-5] her exam was stable and socialwork was consulted for family regarding the possibility fortrach/peg & dnr/i status.  on [4-6] her sodium was 153, mannitolwas stopped, free h2o was increased to 150cc qid, and her examwas stable.  on [4-7] she had a troponin leak 1.19 and a familymeeting w/ palliative care where the conclusion was to make hercmo and she was eventually extubated and started on morphine forcomfort.  on [4-8] she passed away.medications on admission:janumet 50mg/500mg, plavix 75 mg,
