woman who is status post sigmoid resection for duke &apos;s c2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on 7/8/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .she first presented in april of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a duke &apos;s b2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .she then represented in march of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .she underwent a sigmoid resection on 5/17/96 by dr. lenni pain .at the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .one of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .she was therefore staged dukes c2 .an abdominal ct scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .a chest x-ray was read as clear .she is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .she presented to the hematology / oncology clinic on 6/5/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .she began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .she was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of dr. aacent slentjae of the linatpromehack worth hospital for radiation therapy .she began treatment on 6/20/96 .she subsequently had three days of iv bolus 5-fu chemotherapy on june 25th , 26th and 27th of 1996 , which she tolerated well .her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of june .she had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .an mri was performed on 6/25/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .however , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at l5 encroaching on a neural foramen .she presented to the retelk county medical center emergency room on 7/8/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .she denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .past medical history :(1) colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in

:the patient was admitted to the surgical service under the care of dr. lenni pain .her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .a kub performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .an abdominal ct scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .however , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .this was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .these findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .she was admitted and made npo .on admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .she was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .her anc dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .she was begun on iv antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .she was also placed on neutropenic precautions .she continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .however , repeated abdominal x-rays and ct scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .however , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .by 7/15/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .by 7/18/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .she was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on tpn .of note , a picc line was placed for facilitating the administration of tpn .of note , shortly after starting on her tpn her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and tpn was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .she was supplemented with neutra-phos and her tpn was restarted 18 hours later .discharge plan :we recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .during this time she will continue to receive tpn .after that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for
