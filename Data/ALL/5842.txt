diagnosis: unstable angina.discharge diagnosis: coronary artery disease , status post stent ofthe rca.other significant problems: extensive cardiac history , dvt withpe x two , chronic renal insufficiency ,hepatitis b positive.history of present illness: this is a 63-year-old male presentingwith unstable angina. his first presentation with coronary diseasewas in 1986 , when he ruled in for mi and a cath revealed 100%occlusion of the circumflex , 99% d1 , and a subsequent angioplastyof the circ to a 70% residual. he had an exercise treadmill twomonths later and a repeat cath at that time showed 95% restenosisof the circ and a 60% lad lesion , and a 90% d1. in october of1992 the patient again presented with exertional angina. cathrevealed 70% occlusion of the rca , 70-80% lad , and diffuse diseasein the circumflex with a 50% mid-circumflex lesion. he had diffuseglobal hypokinesis and an ef of 40-50%. his angina progressed andin 1994 he underwent a four vessel cabg , svg to the pda and om-1 ,and a lima to the lad and d2. he did well until 1997 , when hepresented with presyncope and was found to have a massive saddlepulmonary embolism. he had a negative hypercoagulative workupafter this. in the recent years he has had a number of episodes ofepigastric pain with exertion and positive stress tests , but noadditional myocardial infarctions. his most recent cath in julyof 1997 showed an occluded circumflex , 80% lad , and subtotalocclusion distally , a 60% mid-rca lesion , and patent svg to the pdaand the om , as well as the lima to the lad. in recent months thepatient describes increasing frequency of anginal episodes provokedby walking more than five minutes or climbing stairs. most oftenthe pain is epigastric , but occasionally substernal. he deniesassociated symptoms of nausea , diaphoresis , or radiation of thepain , but says it is hard to catch his breath. the patient deniesorthopnea , pnd , or lower extremity edema. he has never had pain atrest. on february the patient underwent an exercise treadmilltest walking five minutes on the standard bruce protocol , reachinga heart rate of 96 and a blood pressure of 130/70. he had chestpain as well as 1 mm st depressions. since then his angina hasoccurred with less and less exertion until the morning ofadmission , when he walked outside and experienced substernal chesttightness. he again denies nausea , diaphoresis , palpitations , orradiation of the pain , but does have some shortness of breath. thepain lasts approximately 10-15 minutes and the patient was advisedby his cardiologist , dr. raymond merrihew , to come to the emergentdepartment. in the emergent department he was pain free andreceived aspirin and was started on heparin. ekg showed no acutechanges. ck was 47 and a troponin of 0.24.past medical history: diabetes , hypertension ,hypercholesterolemia , chronic dvts withpulmonary embolism x two , cva , left temporal in the setting of aninr of 4 , with some residual memory and expressive deficits. he isnow on lovenox subcu for dvt prophylaxis. chronic renalinsufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 , hepatitis bpositive , and recent eye surgery in january of 2001.allergies: benadryl , which causes shortness of breath.medications on admission: glucophage 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. , avandia 4mg p.o. b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day , aspirin 325 mg q. day ,gemfibrozil 600 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day.initial physical exam: temperature 98.6 , heart rate 60 , bloodpressure 110/90 , upper 70 , oxygensaturation 98% on 2 l. in general , he is a 63-year-old asian male ,well appearing and in no acute distress. heent: pupils equal ,round , and reactive. extraocular muscles intact. oral mucosa aremoist. there is no jugular venous distention , no lymphadenopathy.neck is supple. lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally , withoutwheezes or rales. cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm ,without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. abdomen: soft , nondistended ,and mildly tender to palpation in the epigastrium. there is norebound or guarding. extremities are warm and well perfused , withno edema.initial laboratories: sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , chloride 106 ,bicarb 24 , bun 15 , creatinine 1.5 , glucose253 , white count 5.3 , hematocrit 36.8 , platelets 144 , calcium 9.5 ,mag 1.7 , ck 47 , troponin slightly elevated at 0.23 , inr 1.1. ekgreveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 , with normal axis and inferiorlyflattened t waves , with t in 1 , l in 6.hospital course: 1. cardiovascularly , the patient was continuedon heparin and ruled out for mi by cks. on 10/21he underwent cardiac catheterization , which showed an 80% proximallad , 100% proximal circ , 80% proximal rca , and 80% proximal rightpda. his lima to the d2 and the lad were patent , as was the svg toom-1. the svg to the rca was 100% occluded. a stent was placed inthe native mid-rca and angioplasty was undertaken of the right pda.after the procedure , the heparin was discontinued and he wastransitioned to lovenox 40 mg subcu q. day for dvt prophylaxis. anecho was obtained , which showed mildly enlarged left ventricle withmoderate reduction in function and ef of 35%. there is thinningand hypokinesis to akinesis of the posterior and inferior segments ,as well as hypokinesis to akinesis of the distal septum. the rvwas normal. pulmonary artery pressures are 25+ right atrialpressure. the patient continues to have episodes of epigastricdiscomfort and belching , and his ekg revealed only nonspecific twave changes. he was scheduled to undergo a submax exercisetreadmill test , but this was held due to an increase in histroponin initially from .23 to .73 , suggesting that he was havingsome mild ischemia with the likely culprit being the small pda thathad been angioplastied during cath. recath was thought to be lowyield without anything to intervene upon after discussion with theinterventional cardiology service. his medical regimen wasmaximized and included a beta blocker , ace inhibitor , and nitrates.his cardiac enzymes trended down to a ck of 32 and a troponin of0.33 upon discharge. he underwent submaximum ett on 3/10 andwalked for nine minutes without ekg changes , but did experience6/10 chest pain and some belching. the test was consideredconsistent with but not diagnostic of ischemia. of note , hereached a max heart rate of 68 and a blood pressure of 142/80during this submaximum stress test. the patient will be dischargedto home to have close follow-up with his cardiologist , dr. devin peachey he will also have a follow-up stress test. he will see hisprimary care physician , dr. panciera , for monitoring of his othermedical issues , including his diabetes. discharge condition isstable , discharge diet is low fat diabetic diet , and dischargemedications are enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day , atenolol50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , gemfibrozil 600
