heart failure.secondary diagnoses: 1. aortic insufficiency.2. valvular cardiomyopathy.3. mitral regurgitation.4. tricuspid regurgitation.5. hypertension.6. hemolytic anemia.7. chronic renal insufficiency.history of present illness: this is a 50-year-old man withvalvular cardiomyopathy , status postthree aortic valve replacements , who presents with no acutecomplaints but a progressive decline in daily function.mr. kozub history begins in 1/11 when he presented withshortness of breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in thesetting of medications ( lasix and/or procardia for hypertension )noncompliance. he was found by echo to have severe aorticinsufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricularhypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 45%. he subsequentlyunderwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valverepair. aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration.one month post-surgery , he required repeat aortic valve replacementwith dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess withcultures positive for yeast , for which he was treated withamphotericin-b , vancomycin and gentamicin. at this time , he alsorequired coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. thishospital course was additionally complicated by development ofthird degree heart block necessitating the implantation of apermanent pacemaker. after discharge , mr. buzo did generallywell for the following years until 1/15 , when he again presentedwith increasing shortness of breath. echo then revealed moderateto severe aortic insufficiency and moderate mitral regurgitation.cardiac catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. at thistime , his aortic valve was again replaced with a st. jude's valve.again , following discharge , mr. kock did generally well until4/3 when again he presented with shortness of breath. at thattime , echo showed at least mild perivalvular aortic regurgitationwith left ventricular dilatation ( the systolic diameter of 6.1 cm ) ,along with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , andan ejection fraction of 15-20%. stress testing at this time showeda physical work capacity of 15.1. it is not documented what wasdone at this time , but apparently his lasix was increased from40 mg b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d. with good effect. regarding thisadmission , mr. bessemer reports that he has been feeling fine and ishere in the hospital because his doctors want to replace his valve ,or if that doesn't work as it hasn't the last three times , to givehim a new heart all together. he reports no increasing dyspnea ,fatigue , ankle edema or abdominal girth. he sleeps on threepillows at night and has not recently been short of breath whenlying flat. he is able to do chores around the house withoutgetting short of breath , but usually does get short of breath afterone flight of stairs. he doesn't complain of significantdisability or quality of life impairment as a result of his heartcondition. he notes that he has not been able to participate inthe marching band over the last year , but that he can play sittingdown. mr. lonn attributes his disease to having beennoncompliant with his procardia following the cerebrovascularaccident in 1993. he says that , "he brought on his heart problemshimself."past medical history: otherwise , notable for an embolism to hisleft foot in 1998 as a result of havingstopped coumadin therapy , chronic renal insufficiency withcreatinine ranging from 1.4-2.2 in 9/3 , and he is status postexploratory laparotomy in 1960 from a gunshot wound.allergies: he is allergic to zestril , which gives him perioralangioedema.medications: lasix 80 mg b.i.d , atenolol 50 mg q.d. , avapro150 mg q.d. , coumadin 5 mg q.d. , zantac 150 mgb.i.d. , niferex 150 mg q.d.family history: his family history is negative for heart disease.social history: he has a 35 pack-year smoking history , but quitone year ago. he has occasional alcohol use.mr. allegrini is on permanent disability leave from his job atdes jack oxall , which involved a lot of heavy lifting. he lives at homewith his wife and 19-year-old son , and spends most of his daythere. he is active in naomin me yonkers , where he likes to play the basedrum.physical examination: general: he is a thin , healthy-appearingblack man in no apparent distress. vitalsigns: heart rate 65 , blood pressure 120/70 , oxygen saturation 98%on room air. neck: his carotid pulses variance and normal involume. jugular venous pressure 7 cm. lungs: clear. his pmi isvibratory in quality and prominent , lateral to the anterioraxillary line. he has a normal s1 , an ejection sound , and a loudprosthetic s2 , a iii/vi systolic murmur at the right upper sternalborder , and a iii/iv holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder radiating to the right upper sternal border. abdomen:non-distended , with no organomegaly. extremities: warm with faintpulses.laboratory data: remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 , hematocrit33.5 , with a mcv of 83.5 , rdw of 28.8 ,reticulocyte count of 6.6 and ldh of 1077. mr. shadler had an echohere that showed severe aortic insufficiency with a severelydilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of 7.0 and systolicdiameter of 6.3 ) , as well as mild to moderate mitral and tricuspidregurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20-25%. exercise testingshowed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. on cath , his pulmonary arterypressure , wedge pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was47/16 , 13 and 379 , which fell to 26/4 , 5 , and 137 , respectivelywith nipride. his systemic vascular resistance was markedlyelevated at 2400 and a thick cardiac output and cardiac index were3.62 and 2.31. amlodipine was then started and lasix was increasedin an effort to reduce his systemic vascular resistance andpulmonary wedge pressure. the remainder of the transplant workupresults were unremarkable except for a significantly reduceddiffusing capacity of 59% corrected , a creatinine clearance of 48.4and a prostate specific antigen of 18.1. prostate biopsy and bonescan were both negative. his admission was otherwise notable foran elevated creatinine to 3.0 in the setting of perioperativelevofloxacin and gentamicin , as well as aggressive vasodilatortherapy. he was allowed to drift back down to his baseline of low2's before discharge.mr. krough was discharged home in stable condition on the followingmedications:discharge medications: atenolol 25 mg q.d. , lasix 120 mg b.i.d. ,coumadin 5 mg q.d. , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.d. ,avapro 150 mg q.d. , niferex 150 mg q.d. , ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.discharge follow-up: he will follow-up with dr. lon poat intwo weeks.dictated by: mervin pavelka , m.d.attending: harris b.
