would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.3.	prazosin-induced hypotension.  in light of very recent change back to prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.4.	neurocardiogenic/carotid hypersensitivity.plan:pre-syncope:	- romi with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers		- telemetry		- 24 hr holter monitor		- carotid doppler and posterior transcranial doppler		- check lytes, cbc + diff in a.m.		- ivf: ns 500cc at 75cc/hr		- continue lisinopril, hctz but discontinue prazosin as inpatient		- asa qod as at home, consider    qddm2:		- check glucose in a.m.		- no insulin requirement;
