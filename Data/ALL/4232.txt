admission date :01/12/1991discharge date :01/20/1991history of present illness :the patient was in her usual state of excellent health until july of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .on 12/23 , she was seen by dr. stonge at bri health where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .a fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .the patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .on 1/5 , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at bri health under local anesthesia .the pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .this prompted further staging work-up .the patient subsequently had a limited chest ct at bri health which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .the poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal ct scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .there was no obvious gior pancreatic tumor identified .the patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .a specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .the patient was transferred to nimaconwood valley hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .she has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .she denied fevers , chills or sweats .there has been no gi or gu symptoms except for constipation .hospital course :the patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .the work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included mri scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a t3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .an epidural mass was present at t10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .an abdominal and pelvic ct scan with iv contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic ivc and distention of the azygous system suggestive of ivc obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .a bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .ahead ct scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .the abdominal and pelvic ct scans showed no suspicious gi masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .the review of the pathology from bri health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .serum markers were normal .the cea was less than 0.7 .the hcg on admission was 30,710 and on 1/19 was 805 .the ca-125 was still pending and alphafeto protein is still pending .hypercalcemia :the patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .she received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .the patient was then switched to po etidronate .ivc obstruction :the patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by ct scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic ivc .this has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .the patient &apos;s low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .hypoxia and shortness of breath :although the patient &apos;s room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .it was felt that the patient &apos;s extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .impending spinal cord compression :the patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .the mri scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of t10 .she was started on decadron and on 1/17 began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( t2 to t5 and t9 to t11 ) .per the patient &apos;s wishes , dr. dalywoo droreite the windgo hospital was consulted for a second opinion regarding the management of her malignancy .dr. linke recommended chemotherapy with pfl .per the patient &apos;s wishes , she was transferred to the windgo hospital for chemotherapy .alt was 53 .ast was 89 .her ldh was 394 .her alkaline phosphatase was 1514 .total bilirubin was 2.1 .direct bilirubin was 1.4 .albumin was 2.3 .calcium 9.1 .hematocrit was 32.5 .white blood cell count was 16.89 .pt was 12.9 .ptt was 27.3 .
