she is to be drawn by the vna the next day ,4/7/04 , and they should call coumadin clinic with the result.given high inr , we held the coumadin on 0/7 and restarted doseon 1/8 at a dose of 3 q.p.m.respiratory-wise , the patient finished levo for presumedpneumonia and had no other respiratory problems. she didcomplain sometimes of subjective shortness of breath , but heroxygen saturation remained at 100% throughout the rest of thehospitalization besides after the cath.gi-wise , she is stable. she got some simethicone for gas and abowel regimen. she was doing well , but given her continued pain ,gi and surgery consulted on her for a question of mesentericischemia. a ct angiogram of the abdomen was performed withnegative workup for mesenteric ischemia. they thought that mostof her discomfort was due to constipation.fen-wise , we replaced her lytes. also we put her on carnitinefor diet supplementation.renal-wise , the patient had increase in creatinine secondary tothe dye load from the cath and both her ct scans. the creatininewas .9 on day of discharge. we held off on starting the acebecause of this , but she should consider getting an ace to add toher regimen given her diabetes and recent mi. that should bestarted as an outpatient.endocrine-wise , her diabetes is in really poor control. she hadsugars ranging from 40 to 400. we changed her regimen to lantus26 units q.p.m. along with novalog pre-meal with 16 beforebreakfast and 8 of novalog before lunch and 8 of novalog beforedinner. her sugars improved greatly , all in the 100s. she hadsevere osteoporosis as well and vitamin c deficiency. considerstarting zometa as an outpatient per primary care doctor , dr.cuaresma prophylaxis with heparin and nexium.dispo: she refused rehab and wanted to go home with services andshe should get home pt and a home vna. she is full code.plan: follow up with the coumadin clinic and get her blood drawnevery 2-3 days. the vna should call 389-227-9900 with theresults of her inr. in addition , her goal again is to have aninr of 3-4. she should follow up with dr. waley , hercardiologist , in 1-2 weeks and dr. jason sorto will come tosee her on 1/5 , 11:30 a.m. at her house. i also recommendedthat patient not add salt to her diet and not drink fluidsgreater than one liter per day and also check her daily weights.discharge medications:1. enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q. day.2. digoxin 0.125 mg po q. day.3. folate 100 mg po b.i.d.4. ativan 0.25 mg po q. 6 hours p.r.n. anxiety.5. nitroglycerin 0.4 1/150 one tab sublingual q. 5 minutes x3p.r.n. chest or neck pain.6. oxycodone 5-10 mg po q. 6 hours p.r.n. pain.7. ocean spray sodium chloride 0.65% two sprays q.i.d. p.r.n.congestion.8. coumadin 3 mg po q.p.m. again starting on 3/139. caltrate plus vitamin d 1 tab po b.i.d.10. nexium 20 mg po q. day.11. maalox 1-2 tabs po q. 6 hours p.r.n. upset stomach.12. toprol xl 200 mg po q. day.13. lipitor 10 mg po q. day.14. combivent two puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness ofbreath.15. torsemide 100 mg po b.i.d.16. lactulose 30 ml po q.i.d. p.r.n. constipation.17. lantus 26 units subcu. q.p.m.18. novalog 16 units subcu. ac before breakfast , novalog 8 unitssubcu. ac before lunch , and novalog 8 units subcu. ac beforedinner.escription document: 3-2891951 mcssten telcc: jonas vespia m.d.vale encemindictated by: schummer , felixattending: pedro tod falkenthal , mddictation id 1020223d: 11/6/04t: 11/6/04[report_end]
