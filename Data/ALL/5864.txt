she had onlymarked mucosal edema. a repeat csf cytology showed decreasingwbc and increasing glucose, indicating overall improvingmeningitis. her persistent fever was thought to be [1-8] drugfever from meropenem, as a screen for other sources of infection (ua/ucxr/bcxr/cxr/liver ct) was negative.  given signs ofimproving meningitis by csf studies and likely drug fever frommeropenem, meropenem was d/c and the pt was placed back onlevoflox with good effect.  fever resolved after 48 hours offmeropenem, and there no signs of active infection after startinglevoflox.  at the time of d/c, the pt has been afebrile > 48hours and is near her neurologic baseline on levoflox.  she willcontinue levofloxacin after d/c until f/u with [hospital ] clinic.2. hyponatremia: she was euvolemic to hypovolemic and had ahypotonic serum. her sodim levels downtrended intiailly withnormal saline hydration and she nadired at 123. her clinicalpicture and urine electrolytes were consitent with siadh insetting of meningitis. she improved slightly with fluidrestriction but also required small boluses of hypertonicsaline.  renal service was consulted and recommended salttablets. she was treated w/ nacl 3gm po tid, resulting in markedimprovement in hyponatremia.  at d/c, she is asymptomatic w/stable sodium.  she will need to continue fluid restriction to <1 l per day after d/c, and will also continue nacl tablets untilf/u with her pcp.3. ldh/alk phos/ast elevation: she had an incidental rise inthese values in the middle of her course. they were checked as ascreen given her persistent fever. it was possibly related tohigh-dose levofloxacin liver toxicity.  an abdominal ct wasnegative for abscess.  after levoflox was resumed towards theend of her hospital course, lfts were followed and were stable.she will require ongoing monitoring of lfts while takinglevoflox.4. left diagphragmatic hernia: this was discovered incidentallyon chest x-ray. she was seen by surgery and a likely congenital(bochdalek) diaphragatic hernia was diagnosed, without obviouslung aplasia or dysfunction. she was slotted for follow-up withsurgery as an outpatient for possible elective correction.5. hearing loss: she has bilateral hearing loss at the time ofd/c, likely [1-8] meningitis.  ent recommends audiologicalevaluation after d/c, w/ close follow-up for 6 months afterresolution of meningitis.  she will f/u in [hospital ] clinic after d/cfor ongoing evaluation.6. hypothyroidism: controlled w/ her outpt dose of levoxylduring her admission.7. code status was full code during this admission.medications on admission:levoxyl ? dosefosamax ? dosedischarge medications:1. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q4-6h(every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever. tablet(s)2. levothyroxine sodium 100 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet podaily (daily).3. alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po qmon(every monday).4. sodium chloride 1 g tablet sig: three (3) tablet po tid (3times a day).disp:270 tablet(s) refills:05. sodium chloride 0.65 % aerosol, spray sig: [12-8] sprays nasalqid (4 times a day) as needed.6. levofloxacin 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2times a day).disp:28 tablet(s) refills:0discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:primary:1) h. influenza meningitissecondary:2) siadh3) h. influenza bacteremia4) thrombocytopenia - resolved5) anemia - prob secondary to acute illness.discharge condition:stabledischarge instructions:1) please take your temperature twice daily (morning and earlyevening) and record on a piece of paper.  please take this withyou to your appointment with dr.
