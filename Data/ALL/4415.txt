[known lastname 49249] is a 54 year old gentleman with htn, dm2, ckd(baseline cr 2.0-2.2), cad s/p cabg [2186], as well as systolicand diastolic heart failure (ef had been as low as 20% but lastknown to be 40%), who was recently admitted to the [hospital1 18]cardiology service from clinic on [2195-10-16] for worsening dyspneaover 2 weeks. chf exacerbation was in the setting of newinferior hk and he was diuresed with hopes of pursuing rhc/lhc.hospital course was complicated by [last name (un) ] (cr>3.0), piv-associatedmssa bacteremia (did not want [last name (lf) ], [first name3 (lf) ] dc'ed on iv nafcillin x4weeks). rhc was done and showed elevated filling pressures, sohe was transferred to the ccu for milrinone to assist with lasixgtt. due to infection, he was only on milrinone for a few hours.he was transferred back to the floor and was diuresed well priorto discharge. he followed up in clinic on [2195-10-27] and was foundto have creatinine elevated to 5.4 despite holding torsemide on[10-22] (took it [10-27]). he was admitted to [hospital1 1516] formanagement of his [last name (un) ].on interview this afternoon, he denies sob at rest. he hasn'tbeen walking much, but doesn't feel "crushing fatigue" now likehe did before. he has been sitting to sleep, which he does thinkis worse than when he was admitted. his itchiness continues, butisn't worse than when in the hospital. he does endorse nausea,diarrhea (8 loose stools a day) which he reports started withthe nafcillin. denies fever, chills, abd pain. he reports "idon't do well with ivs. they always increase my creatinineregardless of what it is." he has been following the same dietand eating light. he reports poor intake of fluid as he's tryingto avoid drinking a lot, "much less than 1l a day." his righteye seems like it has a swollen eyelid today, but he hasn'tnoticed. his wife reports that it always looks like this. noheadache.reports we weighed 219 today (recorded as 219.2), 215 yesterday,211 on discharge.on review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,tia, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or redstools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. he deniesexertional buttock or calf pain. all of the other review ofsystems were negative.cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,palpitations, syncope or presyncope. +orthopnea, +pndpast medical history:hypertensiondyslipidemiadiabetes mellitus-retinopathy s/p laser surgery-peripheral neuropathy with ulcerschronic kidney

he underwent a [date range ]this admission, which did not show any valvular vegetations. asa result, he underwent a shortened course of iv antibiotics (2weeks), which ended on [2195-11-2]. pt remained afebrile and stablethereafter..#. loose stools- recent hospital stay could raise concern for c. diff (ptnauseous, but no f/c). per patient, he feels that loose stoolsbegan w/ nafcillin. either way, may contribute to pre-renalcause of [last name (un) ] (along with recent poor intake). loose stoolsresolved after stopping nafcillin. in addition, he was c. diffnegative...#. cad s/p cabglast cath in [2191] noted severe native 3vd with patent lima-lad,svg-pda, and radial-om1-om2. tte on prior showed new inferiorhk. he was continued on asa, pravastatin, and beta blocker(metoprolol changed to carvedilol). in the future he needs lheart catheterization in order to assess grafts/native vessels.pt was continued on asa and statin. carvedilol was ultimatelyheld given decompensated heart failure and pt put on dobutamineinfusion..#. neuropathic & venous stasis ulcers: pt was seen by wound carespecialist during hospitalization. ulcers appeared to heal moreoptimally when le edema decreased with aggressive diuresis. ptis to followup with pcp to continue dm management and may needreferral to vascular surgery if ulcers persist or worsen..#. diabetes mellitus: stable on iss, and discharged with lantus44u at bedtime with iss..# iron deficiency anemia: hct stable during last admission30-33. iron studies showed low level of iron and pt was given 5days of ferric gluconate iv 125mg to replete iron deficit. pt'sanemia was stable thereafter and discharged with hct of 28.1.#elevated inr: pt's inr was elevated over 2 during hospitalcourse without anticoagulation. this was attributed to vitamin kdeficiency secondary to antibiotic use, malnutrition andmalabsorption from congested bowels related to decompensatedchf. dic labs were not remarkable. pt's elevated inr wasrefractory to po vit k which supported hypothesis of congestionin gi tract causing malabsorption issues. as pt's nutritionimproved and preload reduction, inr trended down to 1.4 at timeof discharge. pt was followed by nutrition during stay and wouldbenefit from outpt nutrition management..>> transitional issues- follow up with ep regarding crt lead placement into lv- could benefit from acei once kidney function improves- readdress restarting carvedilol when hf better controlled offof dobutamine- f/u with pcp regarding lower extremity wounds, medicationreconciliation and diabetes management- would benefit from outpt nutritional support (fluidrestriction, diabetes)- would benefit from cardiac cath once kidney function stableand adequate to assess coronaries/ischemic disease related toheart failure- f/u with cardiologymedications on admission:preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.information was obtained from webomr.1. nafcillin 2 g iv q4hfour week course [date range (1) 49250]2. aspirin 81 mg po daily3. glargine 44 units bedtimeaspart 22 units breakfastaspart 22 units lunchaspart 22 units dinner4. pravastatin 80 mg po daily5. carvedilol 12.5 mg po bid6. hydralazine 50 mg po q8h7. isosorbide mononitrate (extended release) 120 mg po daily8. torsemide 60 mg po bidheld torsemide on last discharge, from [10-25] onwardsdischarge medications:1. aspirin 81 mg po daily2. isosorbide mononitrate (extended release) 120 mg po daily3. pravastatin 80 mg po daily4. hydralazine 75 mg po q8hplease hold for sbp <100rx hydralazine 50 mg 1.5 tablet(s) by mouth three times per daydisp #45 tablet refills:05. outpatient lab workfor vna to draw: on tuesday [2195-11-17], please draw na, k, bun/cre,bicarb, cl, glucose, mg. please fax results to: dr.
