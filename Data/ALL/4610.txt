intubation.  admissioncomplicated by hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventillation..# hypotension, bradycardia, hypopnea:  patient presentedhypotensive to sbp high 70-80 without reflex tachycardia (hrs aslow as 40s).  hypotension was not responsive to extensive volumechallenge (given 7.5 l ns in 24 hours).  the etiology appears tobe a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect.the hr and bp responded to atropine challenge, indicatingincreased vagal tone from some offending process.  started onscopalomine patch.  he was later also started on midodrine forfurther pressure support.  the etiology of the increased vagaltone was most likely related to the uti.  the other majorfactors contributing was probably excess benzodiazepine andopioid. he had pinpoint pupils when he first came in.  on hishome doses of medications the patient had a low respiratoryrate, and retained co2 on abg.  the chronic hypopnea may lead toincreased bradycardia.  the patient's diazepam and methadonedoses were decreased as below..# complicated uti (enterococcus and serratia): patient presentedwith foul smelling urine which is consistent with prior utis. henever had a fever, but he may have been unable to mount feverdue to level of spinal cord lesion. patient was initially onbroad spectrum antibiotics but was narrowed based upon oshculture data.  following 4 days of iv antibiotics, the patientwas narrowed to po amoxicillin for enterococcus plus cipro forserratia. will receive a total of 14 days of abx for complicateduti.  last dose of abx to be given on [2136-5-31]..# toxic/metabolic encephalopathy.  the patient was admittedfollowing sustained altered mental status after an episode ofclonic movements, thought by wife to represent seizure activity. resolved per wife on admission to the icu, but patientcontinued to be sedated with flat affect.  now much improvedonce decreased opiates, likely medication effect, as well asencephalopathy related to the uti.  methadone dose wasdecreased. diazepam dose was decreased. eeg was negative forseizure activity. unclear if patient actually had seizureleading up to original presentation but no evidence during thishospitalization. more likely patient had toxic/metabolicderangements described above. of note, the patient's wife wasvery concerned that the movements she saw (eyes rolling back inhead, patient becoming confused) had happened a previous timewhen the patient received cymbalta. cymbalta was stopped..# ? syringx: patient had been recently diagnosed with cervicalsyringx per osh records. however repeat mri here did not showsyringx but did show diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy withcystic myelomalacia at c4-5 at the site of prior contusion. thiswas conveyed to one of the patient's primary neurologists, dr.[first
