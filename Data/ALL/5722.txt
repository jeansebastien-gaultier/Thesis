with mm including pvd, dm, htn, cad, cri transferredfrom nwh for cellulitis/le pain because pt's podiatric surgeonis at [hospital1 18]. initally presented to nwh because of increasingright foot pain and redness. at nwh, found to have ekg changeswith std in v2-v4, though patient was asymptomatic and said henever had chest pain. unclear if he received abx from there perrecords available. patient was transferred here for furthermanagement..of note, patient was recently hospitalized [date range (1) 91344] in the icuat nwh when he was found at home unresponsive - was hypoglycemicand in arf. patient states he does not remember 'anything' aboutthat hospital stay, the medications he was on or any events thatoccurred then. per report, he was discharged on lovenox for dvtbut when nwh ed was [name (ni) 653], records there indicated that hewas started on lovenox ppx because he was immobile and wassupposed to continue taking it until he was able to consistentlywalk >100 feet. unclear if patient has been administering thelovenox himself as he stated that he no longer gives himselfinsulin because 'it's just too complicated'..on past hospitalization at nwh, also had a troponin has high

regurgitation is seen. the mitralvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valveprolapse. mild to moderate ([12-22]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly

cadiacinterventions was referred to the lab for evaluation as a partof the spinal cord stimulation study. the patient exercised for2.5 minutes on a modified [doctor first name ] protocol and stopped due amarked drop in systolicblood pressure. this represents a very limited exercisetolerance forhis age. the patient denied any neck, chest, arm or backdiscomfortthroughout the study. in the setting of baseline abnormalities,anadditional 0.5mm of st segment depression was noted in v4-v5 atpeakexercise. these changes returned to baseline by minute 3post-exercise. the rhythm was sinus with a single vpb in laterecovery period. marked drop in blood pressure with exercise(136/60mmhg at rest to 98/50mmhg at peak). post-exercisehypertension was noted (172/60mmhg at 10 minutes of recovery)..impression: marked drop in blood pressure with exercise.non-specific ekg changes without anginal type symptoms..cardiac cath:[2147]:comments:1. coronary angiography of this right dominant circulationrevealedsevere native three vessel disease. the lmca had a 30%narrowing. thelad had diffuse luminal irregularities and a 70% proximalstenosis. the mid vessel was diffusely diseased but the distalvessel filled via a patent lima->dlad. the lad supplied a larges2 that had an 80% lesion at its ostium. the lad supplied twomoderate sized diagonal branches which had diffuse luminalirregularities. the lcx tapered quickly and was totally occludedin the proximal vessel after a small om branch. the rca wasdiffusely diseased and totally occluded proximally.2. selective vein graft angiography revealed a widely patentsvg->drca and a widely patent svg->d1/om.3. selective arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated awidely patent lima->lad.4. resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right andleftventricular filling pressures with an lvedp of 29 mmhg and amean pcwpressure of 22 mmhg. in addition, there were v-waves to 50 mmhgsuggesting significant mitral

at 6.9 l/min.note was made of a 10 mmhg gradient across the aortic valve.5. left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient'sunderlying renal insufficiency and recent non-invasive

renalparenchymaldisease. there is limited evaluation of the main renal arteries,but there is no clear evidence of renal artery stenosis. thereis no hydronephrosis.brief hospital course:summary: 74 yo m transferred from nwh with ekg changes, trophere to 0.87 (baseline 0.2) and rle cellulitis, right footosteomyelitis, worsening acute on chronic renal failure# right lower extremity cellulitis and right foot osteomyelitis:the patient presented with right lower extremity cellulitis andwas found to have osteomyelitis in the right foot. vascularsurgery evaluated the patient and thought that treatment for theinfection and ischemia would be a below the knee amputation,though given the patient's poor cardiac status, he would not bea good candidate for surgery. the patient was empiricallystarted on vancomycin and zosyn. a wound culture grew klebsiellaoxytoca and mrsa and continued on those antibiotics. sincevascular surgery would be high risk, podiatry was consulted forlocal debridement. they debrided the area locally, yet erythemaof the right foot existed. it remained unclear whether theerythema was due to ischemia vs. a subcutaneous abscess, so theyrecommended a mri of the foot. the mri was never performedbecause after discussion with the family and primary carephysician, [name10 (nameis) ] was decided for the patient to become cmo. hisantibiotics were withdrawn and wound care applied to the area.# acute on chronic renal failure: the patient presented with acreatinine close to his baseline, however, after periods ofhypotension, likely due to a peri-septic state, his creatininestarting to rise. he was given fluid boluses of 500 cc of normalsaline as needed because his urine lytes showed a feurea~20-25%.renal was consulted and thought his creatinine rise was likelydue to acute tubular necrosis secondary to a pre-renal state.the patient was offered aluminium hydroxide for high phosphatelevels, but the patient refused it. a renal ultrasound showed nohydronephrosis. the patient became progressively oliguric withuop less than 20 cc/hour. renal thought his kidneys wouldunlikely recover (his creatinine rose to 5.3 despiteinterventions). the patient and his family felt that they didnot want to pursue dialysis as an option.#increased troponins: the patient was noted to have hightroponins and excentuated st wave depressions in v3-v5.cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management witha beta blocker, ace inhibitor, statin, and aspirin. the patientwas started on these medications, though became persistentlyhyperkalemic, and therefore, the acei was discontinued. also,his ck and lfts were [last name (lf) 28645], [first name3 (lf) ] the statin dose of 80 mg waslowered to 20 mg and eventually discontinued due to persistently[first name3 (lf) 28645] lfts. an echocardiogram revealed no acute wall motionabnormality, though it did show worsening tricuspidregurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure.throughout his stay, the patient did not have any chest pain.#increased lfts: the patient has a known history of alcoholabuse and increased lfts in the past. during his peri-septicperiod, the patient was noted to have increased lfts, likelymultifactorial due to low perfusion to the liver and alsocongestion secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. the patient didnot have any complaints of abdominal pain, though, he hadhepatomegaly on exam.#gastrointestinal bleed: the patient has a history of a gi bleedand was guiaic positive in the er. in addition, he had apersistently elevated pt/ptt, likely due to either underlyingliver or hematologic disease. the patient's hematocrit remainedstable until [9-26] when his hematocrit dropped from 29.0 to 25.6and was noted to have melenic stools. he continued to havemelenic stools, so he was transfused one unit of blood andtransferred to the micu. his aspirin was discontinued. hishematocrit remained stable in the micu and transferred to thefloors where there were no signs of any gi bleeding.altered mental status: the patient had periods where he hadaltered mental status, mostly at night. his ams was likelymultifactorial due to infection, pain and uremia. he hadsignificant altered mental status on one day when he appearedmore somnolent with respirations=10/min after a dose of morphine2mg iv. narcane was given with some effect. a head ct showed noacute pathology. he continued to have periods of delirium mostlyat night.#pruritis: the patient has been complaining of pruritis,especially on his back, since admission. a variety of remedieswere tried for wound care. according to his son, the pruritishas been long-standing. it might be exacerbated by his renalfailure. a side effect of morphine is a possibility, but hestill had the itching even before the morphine. he is beingtreated with skin care, sarna lotion, hydrocortisone anddoxepin.goals of care: the patient entered the hospital as full code.after the renal and gi bleeding complications from his illness,the patient and his family decided to become dnr/dni. after ameeting with the pcp and the family, they thought the best routewould be to become comfort measures only instead of pursuingdialysis and being chronically cared for in a nursing home. atfirst, it was thought that his beta blocker, aspirin, andantibiotics would be continued, however, after furtherconversation, these medications were discontinued and onlypalliative measures for insomnia, anxiety, pain and constipationwere ordered.medications on
