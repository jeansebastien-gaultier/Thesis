hold for hr &lt;60, sbp &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. she may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in af, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing bb (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. hx nms/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of nms from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see cas notes 11/16/77). however, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. this pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of nms: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. check ck if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.thank you for this consult. we will follow with you.__________________________________peggy ellis, pgy-2 pager #75412
