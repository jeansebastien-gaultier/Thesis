examination being a video swallow studycompleted on [2199-2-7]. that study revealed a mild-moderateoropharyngeal dysphagia that worsened over time.  after fatigue,he demonstrated reduced a-p tongue movement, moderate oralcavityresidue, moderately reduced hyolaryngeal excursion and laryngealvalve closure, moderate vallecular residue and mild pyriformsinus residue.  pt was observed to penetrate both thin andnectarthick liquids with eventual aspiration of residue of thinliquids.because pt's oral and pharyngeal muscles fatigued so quickly, hewas at risk to aspirate any texture of solid or liquid over thecourse of an entire meal.  as such, we recommended that  the ptremain primarily npo at this time with nutrition, hydration, andmedication via peg.per discharge summary from rehab facility, the pt participatedinspeech therapy, had a repeat video swallow study and progressedto a ground solid, thin liquid po diet while at rehab. however,his po intake remained poor despite
