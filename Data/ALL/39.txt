resection in oct 2121, ?chf, and hx of pe with coumadin recently stopped. she said she felt her fluid level increase x 1.5 weeks, called her doctor who increased her lasix to 80 qday 4 days ago and then 80bid yesterday. she thinks this is helping with the fluid but still has increased sob at rest since yesterday afternoon. she can't remember what her pe felt like but says that this is more like fluid overload. she has a mild nonproductive cough and no hemoptysis. no fevers or sick contacts. she had sscp today at noon that was gone in the ed but she says returned while on the floor, with no radition, no n/v/diaphoresis, no palpitations.  she said she can normally walk with a walker ~ 100 ft, but could not get up yesterday or today d/t pain.  she has a history of multiple copd and chf

extremities for deep      indicated to rule out dvt clinically indicated.     3.evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.  there is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  the patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.  4. there are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  they are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.  the right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. the visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.  there are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.5.      legs: there is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for dvt. significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.assessment: 64f with h/o nsclc, copd, chf who presents with 36 hours of increasing sob and a feeling that "the fluid is coming back."  has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.  no other major symptoms.  plan:# sobpatient presents with increasing sob in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.  increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. differential includes chf with fluid overload, pe, malignancy with obstructive component, pna, or copd exacerbation with viral infection. increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, rvh on echo, worsening dyspnea).-large acute pe ruled out with ct-? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of nsclc, ct findings would not account for her dyspnea-cxr and ct negative for acute pna-cxr and ct show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.  bnp is not very high.  however, patient has poor pfts and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.  cough c/w increased volume or viral infection-plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg bid with prn lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 l tomorrow.  avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with arf.-continue home tiotropium, albuterol, fluticasone prop/salmeterol 500/50 (advair diskus 500/50) # nsclclikely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute sob, although chest ct must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.  mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.  -f/u with dr. lacey in am, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from dr. lacey-appt
