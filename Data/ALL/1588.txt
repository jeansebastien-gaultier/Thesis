and operations :1-19-93 bilateral neck re-exploration with right parathyroidectomy and right modified radical neck dissection .history of present illness :the patient is a 52 year old married female with nephrolithiasis , history of depression , bone pain , anorexia , insomnia , headache , nausea , fatigue , malaise , hypercalcemia , elevated pth and history of pancreatitis .recent biochemical investigation revealed calcium of 10.4 , phosphorus of 2.6 and elevated pth of 84 ( normal less than 60 ) .an ultrasound examination of the neck was unrewarding .previous computerized tomography scan , magnetic resonance imaging study and thallium scan showed a right paratracheal mass , consistent with persistent parathyroid tumor .she has undergone previous parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma .the patient is admitted at this time for further treatment of persistent primary hyperparathyroidism .physical examination :on physical examination , the patient is an anxious , middle aged female with a normal voice .her vital signs included a temperature of 96.9 , blood pressure 150/90 , respirations of 18 and heart rate 92 .neck examination reveals a thyroidectomy scar with no palpable thyroid bed masses or lymphadenopathy .her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .she has a right lower neck surgical clip visible on chest x-ray but nothing palpable in this region .breast examination reveals no lumps , skin changes or axillary lymphadenopathy .cardiovascular exam :regular rate and rhythm , with a grade ii / vi systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , well healed incisions but no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .laboratory data :significant for a calcium of 10.4 , phosphorus 2.9 , alkaline phosphatase 76 , magnesium 1.7 , bun and creatinine 10 and 0.7 , ca-125 11.1 ( normal less than 35 ) , sodium 143 , potassium 3.8 and chloride 107 , bicarbonate 25.3 , glucose 99 , direct bilirubin 0.1 , total bilirubin 0.5 , sgot 15 , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 29.2 , platelet count 216,000 , white blood count 18.4 , hematocrit 41.1 , hemoglobin 14.2 , platelet count already mentioned .the urinalysis , chest x-ray and electrocardiogram were within normal limits .hospital course :the patient was admitted and on 1-19-93 , she underwent bilateral neck exploration with excision of a right paratracheal parathyroid adenoma , measuring 23 x 13 x 9 millimeters in size .a limited right neck dissection was performed , removing multiple small cervical lymph nodes .the left thyroid bed was examined , but no residual thyroid was identified .a normal appearing left upper parathyroid gland was seen and preserved .about 75 mg of the right sided parathyroid adenoma was cryopreserved should transplantation be necessary .she underwent dilation and curettage under the same anesthesia .her calcium fell postoperatively , to 6.8 mg % and she developed paresthesias , requiring intravenous calcium .subsequently , the calcium stabilized with oral medication , 2 grams a day .the calcium was fluctuating between 8.3 and 8.7 at the time of discharge .during her hospitalization , she underwent gynecologic and neurological evaluation .she appears to have a right sided ovarian enlargement with previous abnormal papanicolaou smear requiring further investigation .an ultrasound disclosed enlargement of the right ovary .papanicolaou smear previously documented psammoma body .repeat papanicolaou smear studies are pending at the time of this dictation .the curettage of the endometrium was nondiagnostic .a computerized tomography scan and neurologic evaluation was consistent with migraine headaches and no other focal problems .the patient had no hoarseness or airway problems .her sutures were removed on the third postoperative day .the patient was discharged home in stable condition .doctors discharge orders :synthroid 0.125 mg po q.day , os-cal 500 mg po q.i.d.she will remove the neck suture line steri-strips in one week and will follow up with dr. bone in his office in two weeks .ertca d. bone , m.d.tr :iz / bmotdd :1-25-93td
