having been told he had a heart murmur many years ago but just recently diagnosed with aortic stenosis .he has had mild dyspnea on exertion increasing over the past couple of months prior to admission .an echocardiogram in 2011-09-05 revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 to 25% .past medical history :1. cigarette smoking .2. insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .3. proteinuria .4. aortic stenosis .5. cellulitis .6. gangrene of his left second toe in 2010-06-06 followed by an amputation .7. left common femoral dorsalis pedis bypass graft .8. right leg bypass graft in 1999 .9. right below the knee amputation in 2008 .allergies :the patient states he has no known drug allergies .medications :1. aspirin 325 mg po q day .2. vasotec 7.5 mg po q day .3. humalog insulin sliding scale with meals and at bedtime .4. humulin walters insulin 24 units subcutaneous q a.m. and 8 to 16 in the evening depending upon where his blood sugar has been .preoperative laboratory values were unremarkable .the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 2011-10-17 which revealed a 20% left vein osteal lesion as well as 70% lad lesion and an 80% right coronary .the patient was taken to the operating room on 2011-10-18 where he underwent an aortic valve replacement with #23 mm pericardial valve as well as coronary artery bypass graft times two with a lima to the lad and saphenous vein to the acute marginal .postoperatively the patient was transported to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on milrinone , neo-synephrine and levophed drip .the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and subsequently extubated on the night of surgery .he remained on levophed , milrinone and neo-synephrine drips and was hemodynamically stable .n. saez clinic consult was obtained due to hyperglycemia and the need for insulin drip in the intensive care unit .on postoperative day the milrinone was weaned down .the levophed had been discontinued as the neo-synephrine and the patient was beginning to progress hemodynamically .upon discontinuation of the milrinone the patient 's sv02 had dropped significantly in the low 50 s.the patient had decreased exercise tolerance and therefore was placed back on his milrinone to keep his cardiac index greater than 2.0 .over the next couple of days it was very slowly decreased as his ace inhibitors were increased orally .the patient ultimately was weaned off the milrinone , transitioned to captopril on postoperative day five and remained hemodynamically stable .once the patient had remained off of inotropics for approximately 24 hours , he had been given diuretics and ace inhibitors and remained hemodynamically stable he was transferred from the intensive care unit to the telemetry floor on postoperative day six .a physical therapy evaluation was obtained for assistance and mobility .cardiac rehabilitation was initiated at that time .on 2011-10-24 postoperative day six consultation heart failure cardiology service was obtained .it was their recommendation to continue ace inhibitors , to continue daily weights , to switch the patient to a long acting beta-blocker and to enroll the patient in postoperative cardiac rehabilitation as well as to make sure the patient was on statin drugs .these measures were all instituted .the patient continued to progress from cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy standpoint while on the floor .the patient remained hemodynamically stable over the next few days , continued to increase with physical therapy and ambulation .his blood sugars were followed by the cape cod hospital clinic service and insulin has been adjusted accordingly .today , 2011-10-31 , postoperative day 13 the patient remains stable and ready for discharge to home .the patient 's condition today is as follows :temperature 96.9 f , pulse 84 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 106/59 .most recent laboratory values are from 2011-10-25 which revealed a white blood cell count 8.4000 , hematocrit 35 , platelet count 202,000. sodium 133 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 93 , co2 30 , bun 24 , creatinine 0.7 , glucose 198 .the patient 's finger stick blood glucose levels range from 151 to 390 over the past 24 hours and his insulin scale has been adjusted upward to compensate for that .neurologically the patient is grossly intact .pulmonary exam he is clear upper lobes , diminished bilateral bases left greater than right .coronary exam is regular rate and rhythm .his abdomen is benign .his sternum is stable. his incision is clean and dry steri strips intact .his extremities are warm and well perfused with minimal edema of his left foot as well as his right stump .he is able to apply his prosthesis and ambulate as well .discharge medications :1. lasix 40 mg po

atorvastatin 10 mg po q day .9. toprol xl 100 mg po q day .10. bollin insulin 18 units subcutaneous q a.m. , richard insulin 14 units subcutaneous q p.m.11. sliding scale humalog regular insulin for breakfast is blood glucose of 151 to 200 equal 4 units , 201 to 250 equal 6 units , 251 to 350 equal 12 units , greater than 350 equals 15 units .for lunch blood glucose of 101 to 150 equals 4 units , 151 to 200 equals 7 units , 201 to 250 equals 8 units , 251 to 350 equals 12 units , greater than 350 equals 15 units .dinner blood glucose 101 to 150 equals 2 units , 151 to 200 equals 3 units , 201 to 250 equals 6 units , 251 to 350 equals 12 units , greater than 350 equals 15 units .discharge condition :stable .discharge diagnosis :1. aortic stenosis .2. coronary artery disease .3. type i

patient is also to follow up with his primary care physician for diabetes management .he is to follow up with dr. east here at the heart failure clinic to continue follow up with cardiac rehabilitation and heart failure management .brown des stone , m.d.07-760dictated by : anthony o carreno , m.d.medquist36d : 2011-10-31 10:25t : 2011-10-31 10:45job #: 02527signed electronically by :
