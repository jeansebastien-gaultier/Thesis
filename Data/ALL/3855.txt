intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (jvp up, some edema of cxr). started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation. rhythm - bradycardia, no acute issuesiscenmia - demand ischemia vs nstemi. follow markers. likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require ct surg consult.  have request fmc records. heme - ffp + lasix prior to cath. heparin, resp -  wean vent post cath/opprophy - heparin/nexium/peridex while vented. code: full______________s. stanley oberg, md, phdmedicine pgy-2pager 86807
