record date: 2091-05-08      may 08, 2091     billy vanpelt, m.d.orlando regional lucerne hospital60 kessler farm drivewhite hall, mn 76715  re:nicholas-xaviar, fredmr #65856594 dear dr. vanpelt, i had the pleasure of seeing mr. nicholas-xavier in follow up after his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. i followed him in the hospital when he was admitted in apr for a left foot ulcer.  as you know, he is a 77 year-old man from eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral lower extremity bypasses in the past.  he was admitted in apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.  his preoperative evaluation included a dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of dobutamine induced hypokinesis in the inferior wall.  since this was a small area, it was felt he could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.  he underwent left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative with no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his ekg. however postoperative enzymes revealed peak ck of 455 with an mb fraction of 35 and a troponin of 19.5.  as a result of his large troponin leak, he underwent cardiac catheterization on apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary artery, 100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal pda.  postoperative echocardiogram on apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.  due to his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on apr 20, 2091. he had lima to his left anterior descending artery and a vein graft to his obtuse marginal artery.  he did not have a graft to his posterior descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary     nicholas-xaviar, fredmr #65856594may 08, 2091page two  to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries. postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on april 27, 2091.  his medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, zocor 20mg, subcutaneous heparin 5000 units b.i.d., metformin 500mg, glipizide 10 in the morning and 5 in the evening, captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and lopressor 25mg q.i.d. since that time, he has done quite well. he has been progressing at rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times per day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of his house.  he denies any chest pain with walking.  he has no shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  he has been sleeping on two pillows for a long time and this is unchanged.  he denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or claudication symptoms with walking at this time.  he does complain of some pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. he has plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.on physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 60.  his jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes without carotid bruits.  his lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.  his heart has a slight laterally displaced pmi with a regular rate and rhythm, normal s1, and s2 and no audible murmur or gallop.  his chest incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. he has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing well.  there is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and does not appear to be cellulitic.  his feet are warm. his ekg in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with t wave inversions in v1 through v5, 1 and l.  they are particularly deep in v2 and v3 but are unchanged from his discharge ekg from the hospital. in summary, mr. nicholas-xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and three weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.  he will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over time. i have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline.  i have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase his zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.  i have also changed him to once daily cardiac regimen so i have changed his   nicholas-xaviar, fredmr #65856594may 08, 2091page three  captopril to lisinopril 20mg q.d. and his lopressor to toprol xl 100mg p.o. q.d..  he will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he develops any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac concerns. he was seen, examined and discussed with dr. steve franks.  thank you for allowing me to participate in his care. sincerely,    olivia spence,
