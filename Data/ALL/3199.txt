lopressor 50 milligrams p.o.b.i.d. ; glyburide 2.5 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; premarin 0.625 milligrams p.o. q.d. ; lasix 40 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; trandate 200 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. ; prevacid 30 milligrams p.o. q.d.physical examination :she is in no acute distress .she is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .blood pressure is 138/72 .she is on room air at 90% .oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .the lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .holosystolic murmur , ii / vi , at the left lower sternal border .the abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .there was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .there were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .neurological examination was nonfocal .laboratory data :significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. bun 14 , creatinine 1 .liver function tests were within normal limits .urinalysis was negative .electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .hospital course :the patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .the patient was evaluated by the dental service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .the patient received periprocedure antibiotics .the patient underwent echocardiogram on jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .the ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .the aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .the ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .dissection flap was noted .there was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmhg plus right atrial pressure .there was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .the patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on jul 25 , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .the aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .true lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .the true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .the patient was taken to the operating room on jul 26 , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .on postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .the patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .beta blocker was started as well .the patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .the patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .she did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient 's distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .the patient was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .she will require continued therapy .otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .she has worked well with physical therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .the patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .the determination was made not to coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .the patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without coumadin therapy .the patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .on 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .disposition :the patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .she will follow-up with dr. spotted in four to six weeks ;
