pain as exactly like theanginal pain that she had prior to her coronary artery bypassgraft. the total duration of this episode was approximately tenminutes. by the time she presented to the emergency room , she hadno diaphoresis and no chest pain and was feeling perfectly normal.the latest echocardiogram in april of 1997 showed an ejectionfraction of 35% with mid to distal septal and apical akinesis andinferior akinesis with mild mitral regurgitation. in july of1997 , she went 4 minutes and 18 seconds on an exercise tolerancetest with thallium which showed only fixed defects , no reversibledefects.past medical history: significant for coronary artery disease andcoronary artery bypass graft with cardiacrisk factors of hypertension , family history and high cholesterol ,hypothyroidism and remote peptic ulcer disease with history ofcholecystectomy and appendectomy.medications on admission: 1 ) zocor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. 2 ) prinivil5 mg p.o. q. day. 3 ) pendalol 2.5

mother died of a myocardial infarction at age 58and her brother had a coronary artery bypass graftat age 79 and she has a sister with alzheimer's disease.physical examination: the patient is a pleasant , elderly woman inno apparent distress. vital signs:temperature 99.4 degrees , heart rate 87 , blood pressure 115/78 ,respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air. the restof the physical examination was significant for a clear oropharynx.lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. cardiovascularexamination was regular rate and rhythm , s1 and s2 and a two out ofsix systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border withno gallop or rub. abdomen was soft with good bowel sounds.extremities revealed no edema. neurological examination wasnon-focal. rectal examination was guaiac negative with no masses.laboratory: laboratory studies were significant for a white bloodcell count of 5.46 , hematocrit 40.1 , platelets 190.cardiac troponin i was 0.0. ck was 102. urinalysis was negative.chest x-ray was clear with no infiltrates. ekg was normal sinusrhythm with normal intervals and normal axis with a left bundlebranch block pattern and first degree atrioventricular block withno change compared to an ekg done on march , 1997.hospital course: the impression on admission was that this is awoman with known coronary artery disease statuspost coronary artery bypass graft who is now experiencing unstableangina with diaphoretic episodes , both at rest and exertion and nowsubsternal chest pain. she ruled out for a myocardial infarction.on april , 1998 , she had a standard bruce exercise tolerancetest in which she went 3 minutes , 30 seconds and stopped because ofchest pain. this was typical of anginal pain and resolved eightminutes into recovery. the ekg had no changes with a left bundlebranch block at baseline and this was considered to be consistentwith but not diagnostic of ischemia. she subsequently underwentcardiac catheterization which revealed patent grafts with her knownunderlying native disease. her right atrial pressure was 4 , rightventricular 46/8 , pa 42/22 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 19.from here , she was managed medically with increases in her aceinhibitor , statin and the addition of nitrates. after the cardiaccatheterization , she developed a large right groin hematoma at thepuncture site and a bruit was noted. an ultrasound was done thatrevealed a pseudoaneurysm of the common femoral artery. she wasfollowed by vascular surgery and on may , 1998 , had afollow-up ultrasound which confirmed the presence of apseudoaneurysm in her common femoral artery measuring 2 x 1.5 cmsurrounded by a large hematoma. on may , 1998 , the patientunderwent surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm without anycomplications and she was discharged on march , 1998 withfollow-up with both dr. polito of vascular surgery and dr. khat ,her cardiologist.medications on discharge: 1 ) aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day. 2 )colace 100 mg
