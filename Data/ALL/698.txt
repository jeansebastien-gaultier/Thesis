admission date :2014-12-03discharge date :2014-12-18service :medicinehistory of present illness :the patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known cardiopulmonary history who presented with a chief complaint of dyspnea on exertion as well as exertional chest tightness which was acute-on-chronic .the patient stated her symptoms began in 2011 and have increased in intensity and frequency every since then .she reports dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness daily which worsened significantly one day prior to admission .says that she could not walk a few yards without developing symptoms .she describes the chest tightness as substernal and epigastric .she denied any associated nausea , vomiting , diaphoresis , lightheadedness , or dizziness .she does have radiation of the pain to her neck and jaw bilaterally .she also describes a fast heart rate and palpitations .she stated her symptoms improved with rest , and she denied any symptoms beginning when she was at rest .the patient reports a previous workup which included a negative exercise treadmill test , a normal mibi in 2011-04-10 , and a normal echocardiogram in 2012 ( except some borderline mild pulmonary hypertension ) with an ejection fraction of 55% .review of systems :review of systems was significant for menopausal symptoms ( for which she has attempted hormone replacement therapy , discontinued in 2014 ).she also reports difficulty sleeping , daytime sleepiness .she sleeps on elevated pillows secondary to her gastroesophageal reflux disease .occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the past but none recently .occasional lower extremity edema , left greater than right .no abdominal or urinary complaints .hospital course :the patient is a 52 - year-old female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness , who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms .1. cardiovascular :the patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina .however , given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past , it was thought to be unlikely .however , the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker , and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated .a stress thallium was planned for the day following admission .however , on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded , and a code was called .further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the 130 s and a heart rate in the 80 s.over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive .she was treated with a fluid bolus .the patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive .she reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal .she was able to get to bed at which point she passed out .she denied any chest pain or pressure , and no shortness of breath during this event .a rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm .an electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes .her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response .it was determined to stop the beta blocker , and atropine was placed at the bedside .on the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than 100 .her stress test was cancelled .a ct angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension .she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry .a pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient 's hypotension .there was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease , and given the patient 's grave's disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible .in addition , consideration was given to sarcoidosis , human immunodeficiency virus , and drug-induced given her history of herbal medication use .it was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension .it was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory .a right heart catheterization was performed on 2014-12-05 .a pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response .in addition , a ct angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe ground-glass and scattered adenopathy .therefore , in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause .chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative ct angiogram .chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient 's normal pulmonary function tests and dlco in 2012 as well as a normal ct angiogram .collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out ; however , given the patient 's lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely , and the patient 's human immunodeficiency virus test was negative .therefore , it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension .consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker ; however , given the patient 's poor response to lopressor , it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient 's pulmonary hypertension .therefore , her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of flolan as a treatment .plans were made for placement of a hickman catheter and initiation of flolan treatment .however , on 12-07 , the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness .upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake , alert , and oriented with a pulse in the 80 s, with pressure in the 80 s, and satting 100% on room air .she described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest .the patient was treated with 2 liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the 90 s.review of telemetry revealed an 8 to 9 beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to 60 beats per minute .the etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear , but was felt likely secondary to the patient 's tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension , was very preload dependent , and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle .given the patient 's persistent hypotensive episodes , and decreased urine output , she was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit for management prior to initiation of flolan therapy .on 12-08 , the hickman catheter was placed in preparation of flolan administration .during the mass. mental health center medical intensive care unit stay , the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than 90 .she had no further episodes of bradycardia during her medical intensive care unit stay .in addition , the patient 's urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy , suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload .the patient continued to be followed by the electrophysiology service , who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement .this was to be deferred until after the patient had her hickman in place .because the patient 's pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization , it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for flolan therapy .flolan was initiated on 12-08 at 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .the patient was monitored for symptoms of flolan therapy including nausea , vomiting , first bite jaw claudication , or hypotension .over the course of the hospital stay the patient 's flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of flolan overdose .the patient was felt to be stable on her current flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor .a high resolution ct was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension ; however , the patient refused it at this time .plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated .however , on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her hickman catheter site .surgery was notified and pressure was applied ; however , it did not stop oozing .a surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding .in addition , an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding .following this episode the patient felt like she was " too stressed " for pacemaker placement .therefore , she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events .over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her flolan , and flolan teaching was continued .she continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness , shortness of breath , and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the flolan bag needed to be changed .however , over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity .on 12-15 , the patient went for placement of a pacemaker .she had dual-mode , dual-pacing , dual-sensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at 60 ppm , and upper rate of 120 ppm with a paced av of 150 msec .the patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement .at the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating her flolan therapy well .she had received a full course of flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home .she was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group , and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of flolan therapy .following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry , and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition .2. infectious disease :the patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission .however , she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .however , near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her foley catheter was removed .a urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive .therefore , the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a 10 - day course .following initiation of the antibiotic the patient 's white blood cell count quickly came down , and she remained afebrile .at the time of discharge , the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature .she will complete two more days of levaquin therapy as an outpatient .3. renal :the patient 's bun and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay .these remained stable and within normal limits .it was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence , and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the medical intensive care unit .4. gastrointestinal :the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease .she was continued on protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues .5. hematology :the patient 's hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay .despite bleeding from the hickman site , she did not require any transfusion therapy .6. fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :the patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay .her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits , being replaced as needed .she was discharged to home on a regular diet .7. endocrine :the patient with a history of hypothyroidism .she was continued on her regular synthroid dose .she will need a tsh and t4 checked as an outpatient .8. code status :the patient is a full code .9. flolan administration :at the time of discharge , the patient was tolerating a flolan dose of 5 nanograms per kilogram per minute .a physical therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a 6 - minute walk test .on room air , the patient 's oxygen saturation was 95% and dropped to 88% following a 6 - minute walk .the patient was discharged to home with appropriate flolan teaching and supplies .she was to follow up with dr. savage in the clinic the following week .
