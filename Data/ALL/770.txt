(it is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  mrs. doss will call me after her eeg and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the dilantin.  of note, dr. isaac ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  as i am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     sincerely, yasmine florence-gagnon, mdeducare-pullman neurology
