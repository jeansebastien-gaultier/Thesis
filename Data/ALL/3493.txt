thank you for referring your patient, victoria carina jorgenson to me for apreoperative evaluation for thyroidectomy on september 17, 2071. as you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease. she noticed a nodule in her neck in april or may of this year andbrought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it hasincreased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy andshe is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in septemberof this year.  in terms of her cardiac history, she was welluntil four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breathand was admitted to lake park hospital for congestive heartfailure.  at that time, she had an exercise thallium scan whichrevealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary toshortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and adilated left ventricle.  in addition, she had an echo in june of2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitralregurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction. she has never been hospitalized since that time for hercongestive heart failure and has been treated medically with goodresult. she currently denies any orthopnea, pnd, angina orclaudication.  she does have chronic mild lower extremity edema.in fact, she has never had chest pain or chest pressure to herrecollection.  she is able to walk up the 10 stairs to her houseand can unload groceries from her car, up those stairs. she isable to shop, walk through the grocery store without difficultyfrom chest  jorgenson, vivian leamr #471-90-84-7               -2-            august 21, 2071 pains or shortness of breath, although she occasionally stopssecondary to fatigue.   her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,chf, chronic anxiety and this thyroid nodule. she has never hadsurgery. her family history is significant for a mother who diedof myocardial infarction at the age of 55.  her social history, she smoked 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day for40 years and quit four years ago. she denies alcohol, intravenousdrugs or cocaine use.  she lives with her husband and brieflyworked in amy's baking company but for the past 20 years is an electrical engineer.  shehas no known drug allergies.  her current medications include labetalol 100mg po bid, captopril50 po tid, digoxin 0.25mg po qd, coumadin 5 po qd, lipitor 10 poqd, lasix 40 po qd, coreg 12.5 po bid, nitroglycerin patch dailyand gemfibrozil 600mg bid.   on physical exam in my office, her blood pressure was 170/85 inher left arm and 165/70 in her right. her heart rate was 104 wheni saw her, although it was 80 on her ekg today. her jvp was 7centimeters. her carotids were brisk upstrokes without carotidbruits. her chest is clear to auscultation without crackles. herheart has a non displaced pmi with a regular rate and rhythm withoccasional ectopic beats. she has a normal s1 and s2 with a 2/6systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border withoutradiation. her abdomen is soft with positive bowel sounds. herextremities have 2+ distal pulses and trace peripheral edema.   her ekg today is normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80.  she has adiffuse st and t wave abnormality consistent with digoxineffects.  she has poor r wave progression consistent with an oldanterior septal mi but no acute ischemic changes.   in summary, ms. jorgenson is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary diseasewith congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%,likely secondary to coronary disease from an anterior myocardialinfarction, although she has never undergone heartcatheterization.  she is currently undergoing evaluation for athyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule.  jorgenson, vivian leamr #471-90-84-7               -3-            august 21, 2071 issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burdensince 2067, i have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test withimaging. if this is similar to her previous study showing onlyfixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then i feel that shewill be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperativemyocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure iswell treated and therefore, will not preclude her from havingsurgery.   issue number two, is her anticoagulation for low ejectionfraction.  she is currently on coumadin for low ejectionfraction. as far as i know, she has never had atrial fibrillationand she has never been told that she had an irregular rate orrhythm.  therefore, i recommend that she stop her coumadin 6 daysprior to surgery and it can be restarted several days aftersurgery without heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeonsas to how may days she should wait after surgery beforerestarting that medication.  she will otherwise remain on hercurrent medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist andprimary care physician, dr. charles van.  if her stress testis without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me forfurther evaluation.   thank you for referring this interesting patient. she was seenand examined with dr. voss.  sincerely,    pamela imperial, m.d. pi/waldron cc:charles van, m.d. jordan, fl  83712      not
