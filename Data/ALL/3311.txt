post diagnosis of lung mass for which she was beingworked up on an outpatient basis..1. nsclc, metastatic to brain/nausea/vomiting/headache -- uponadmission a head ct was performed which identified multipleinfra and supra tentorial brain lesions, including the brainstem.  high dose steroid therapy was initiated to treatassociated vasogenic edema.  a left stereotactic brain biopsywas performed on [5-30].  post-operatively a head ct was done, anddetermined to be stable.  she was then returned to the icupending diagnosis and further management.  she was initiated onwhole brain radiation on [2184-6-2] and was monitored in the icufor signs and symptoms of increased icp.  she was subsequentlytransferred to the hospitalist service for the remainder of hercourse.during initiation of her brain radiation treatments, patient hadintractable nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypertension, butrepeat ct head did not show increased edema.  she continued oniv dexamethasone 6 mg q6 hours, iv keppra 1000mg q12 hours, andiv hydralazine for blood pressure control (see below).for nausea control, she was kept on compazine, zofran, ativan,phenergen prn.oncology, neuro-oncology, and neurosurgery was involvedthroughout her hospital course.  her symptoms gradually subsidedand she was transitioned to po meds.  she will complete theremainder of her radiation treatments as an outpatient.  she hasfollow up scheduled with thorcaic oncology and neuro-oncology..2. hypertension -- while unable to tolerate po, she was treatedwith iv hydralazine for goal sbp of less than 130 mmhg.  whenable to tolerate po, she was transitioned to lisinopril.  thepatient was instructed to followup with her pcp regarding herblood pressure..3. asthma -- remained stable throughout her course, continuedprn
