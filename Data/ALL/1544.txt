subtherapuetic dilantin dose-will finish one gram load and start po dilantin in am at 300 tid per neurology recommendations and check levels and await levels 10-15. head ct negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure. patient on keppra in past-needed now? will ask neurology2.	pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with vancomycin (1 gram given in ed) and ceftriaxone.3.	high wbc-abd ct reportedly negative as was cxr-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and wbc and continue abx until cultures negative4.	electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.5.	renal transplant-continue prednisone6.	cva-will continue aggrenox for now7.	other-continue home meds for now except lactobacillus as
