further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.past medical history:  1.	metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  stage iv-b s/p taxotere therapy.2.	diabetes mellitus:  not taking any medications for sugar control.  last hgba1c (06/19/83) was 5.30.3.	htn:  on multiple medications for blood pressure control.  no evidence of end-stage renal damage.4.	hypercholesterolemia:  being treated with lipitor 10 mg daily.  last total cholesterol (06/18/83) was 139;

the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, h. influenza, staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as legionella sp, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.  based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.a.	start levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.b.	sputum gram stain and culturec.	blood culturesd.	pneumococcus antigen screeninge.	u/a, urine legionellaf.	  ns at 75 cc/hour.  if po intake is not increased, will switch fluids to d5  ns.g.	tylenol for fever, zofran for nausea.h.	incentive spirometry every two hours while awake.2.	dizziness:  the patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.  potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, cad), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypoglycemia).  this patient has a history of cad, but ekg findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.  the patient has not had an increase in the bun or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.  labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.  the dizziness was positional in nature.  the patient reports long-standing poor po intake, particularly because he was npo for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms. in this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor po intake and decreased sympathetic tone.  a.	  ns at 75 cc/hour.  if po intake is not increased, will switch fluids to d5  ns.b.	check orthostatics daily.3.	metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  patient presents with known stage iv-b metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new ct findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.  has been on taxotere for the last six months.a.	patient does not know of new findings, to discuss with dr. otero in am.b.	consider alternative therapies.4.	anemia: patient presents with microcytic anemia (mcv=73).  not known to be iron-deficient.a.	iron studies (iron, ferritin, tibc) to assess iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease.b.	guaiac stool for evidence of occult blood.5.	htn:  a.	check orthostatics daily.b.	patient is stable on current regimen.  no changes to medications.6.	cad/hypercholesterolemia:a.	continue with lipitor 10 mg dailyb.	cardiac enzymes negative times one.  per oncology fellow, no need to cycle given stability of tw changes in ekg and lack of anginal symptomsc.	low fat diet7.	renal vein thrombosis: a.	stable on coumadin.b.	clarify goal inr level.  currently inr=3.4.8.	prophylaxis:a.	nexium for gi prophylaxisb.	colace/mylanta for constipation.c.	low-fat, no added salt, no concentrated sugar diet.d.	finger sticks after each meal._______________________________nathan altman, hcc iii pager #74972team 3 intern addendum:the patient was seen and examined.  agree with above excellent hcc3 note.  briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h/o esophageal ca (stage 4b), dm, htn, cad s/p lad stent, renal v. thrombosis on coumadin.  he presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of "room spinning" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea.  his po intake has been decreased due to nausea.  has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and cxr evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam r > l.  he was admitted to medicine for treatment of pna in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.  will treat with levofloxacin 750 po qd to cover cap.  send legionella urinary agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ed).  check orthostatics.  ivf gentle hydration.  need to clarify goal inr in setting of coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.  microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.  ekg and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.  will treat nausea symptomatically.  discussed with onc fellow (dr. kramer).____________________________gerald echols mdpager 69793
