10/16/2004attending: milford wizwer m.d.history of present illness:this is a 36-year-old man with a history of a familialcardiomyopathy , ejection fraction estimated at around 15% withmarked left and right chamber enlargement , severe mitralregurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and pa pressures of 51plus right atrium , as per an echo in 2003. he was also statuspost icd placement in 2001. at baseline , he has a one staircaseexercise tolerance before becoming short of breath. he alsoadmits that he has been having increasing orthopnea andparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. he denies , chest pain ,palpitations , or peripheral edema. he also has a history ofdietary fluid intake and medications noncompliance leading toheart failure exacerbations. currently , he states that he hasbeen eating "salty foods , " and has been drinking a lot of extrafluids because he has been feeling dry and is not always takinghis medications. consequently , he has noticed a worsening in hisexercise tolerance , worsening orthopnea , and most notably anincrease in abdominal girth. because of these symptomsconsistent with decompensated heart failure , his physicianssuggested that he be admitted to the hospital for management ofhis decompensated heart failure. of note , he has been previouslyon a transplant list , but has been delisted given hisnoncompliance and continuation of tobacco use.past medical history:in addition to the cardiomyopathy is chronic renal insufficiencywith the creatinine ranging from 1.2 to 3.5 at times.medications on admission:aldactone 25 mg once a day , k-dur 40 meq once a day , lisinopril2.5 mg once a day , isordil 20 mg three times a day , digoxin 0.125once a day , torsemide 200 mg twice , and metolazone p.r.n. forvolume overload.social history:as mentioned , he is smoking one-half per day of cigarettes ,occasional alcohol use , no iv drug use.family history:his mother , his brother , and his cousin and nephew all have thefamilial cardiomyopathy.physical examination:on the day of admission , he presented with the jvp in the 18 to20 range on the physical examination with positive hjr. hiscardiac exam had a positive s3 of laterally displaced pmi withthe right ventricular heave. he also had a 2/6 systolic murmur.his abdomen was distended , nontender , but likely with ascites andpalpable liver edge. his extremities were warm without edema.hospital course:from the cardiac standpoint , we initially attempted to diuresehim iv torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. however , he did not respond wellenough to this regimen , and therefore we started drip withzaroxolyn p.r.n. we also stopped his isordil and ace inhibitorearly on because of blood pressures in the 80s. on admission ,his creatinine was 2.0 and on the next day of admission , it was2.2 with low blood pressures , at which point , we decided to starta low-dose dopamine drips at 2 mcg per hour. however , his urineoutput was only about 500 cc negative , so we further increasedthe lasix drip from 10 mg an hour to 20 mg an hour after 200 mgiv lasix bolus. on this combination of the lasix drip at 20 anhour and dopamine at 2 mcg per hour , he began to have very goodand effective urine output at approximately 2-3 liters per day ,negative , also reflected in his total weight , and came in withadmission weight of around 90 kg. on each day , he diuresed aboutan half to kilo off until the day of discharge , at which point ,he was less than 86 kg. we monitored strict i's and o's , checkeddaily weight. during the course of his diuresis , his sodiumlevels were decreasing mostly secondary to the patient drinking alot of free water. the combination of free water intake in thesetting of natriuresis resulted in further worsening of hishyponatremia from an admission sodium of 128 to 124 , eventuallyto 122. we strictly reinforce the need to limit his fluid intaketo less than 2 liters per day , and at that point , his sodiumlevels than rebounded to 124 and also 128 on the day ofdischarge. we monitored the b.i.d. lytes. eventually , his bloodpressures remained stable. his jvp decreased from 18 to 20 onadmission to about 10 to 12 and continued to have good urineoutput , thus we weaned off the dopamine , but continued the lasixdrip for one more day. we then discontinued the lasix drip andtransitioned him back over to torsemide 200 b.i.d. p.o. , whichwas his home regimen and watch him for another 24 hours. hecontinued to diurese at this dose , but then on the day ofdischarge , his i's and o's were finally about 500 cc negative ,which is a change from about 1 to 2 liters negative per day. hisjvp was about 9 to 10 and his creatinine was stable at 1.7. were-added his isordil at 10 mg t.i.d. for the last 24 hours andhis blood pressures were stable in the 90s. given his potassium ,which was always borderline low in the 33 or 35 range , we decidedto increase his aldactone dose to 25 mg b.i.d. , but given hisunderlying renal insufficiency , we have decreased his standingk-dur from 40 meq a day to 20 meq a day. an echo was done , whichshowed an ejection fraction of 20% and 4+ mr. they did notcomment on the synchrony on the preliminary report. however , heis a candidate for bi-v pacing given his mildly widened qrscomplex stage iii heart failure and having been on a very goodheart failure regimen up until this point.discharge medications:at discharge , his medical regimen consisted of digoxin 0.125 mgonce a day , torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. , aldactone 25 mg b.i.d. ,isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and k-dur 20 meq. we also added folate 5mg to his regimen because he had an elevated homocystine level.he also takes ambien at night p.r.n. for insomnia.disposition:he is being discharged to home with plan to follow up with dr.grassi in her thyroid clinic on 3/1/05 .  he has been again urgedto stop smoking and to be complaint with his regimen because heis a good heart transplant candidate and for the current time , heis not listed given the aforementioned reasons. overall , mr.plagmann states that his symptoms have drastically improved. heno longer has orthopnea. he is able to exert himself much morewithout symptoms of shortness of breath or lightheadedness , andhe is eager to go homeescription document: 1-0474396 emssten teldictated by: burk , marianoattending: miricle , brendandictation id 5597826d: 6/19/04t: 6/19/04
