normotensive even after d/c ofsome of her home htn meds ( see renal ). rhythm: pt was on telemetry forfirst day of admission , and alternated between sinus rhythm and afib.pulm: pna: pt had left lower lobe opacity on cxr. decision was made tostart antibiotics. pt had a positive d-dimer , but pe was very unlikelyin the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation. the patient has ahistory of chf , but had no signs of chf on exam during thishospitalizaiton although her cxr was read as mild pulmonary edema.renal: arf: creatine on admission was 1.8 , up from a baseline of1.2-1.3. given her h/o poor po intake and euvolemic to dry exam ,this was thought likely due to prerenal hypovolemia. herlasix , lisinopril and colchicine were held , as they might contribute tofurther arf , and she got gentle ivf ( approximately 1l ) and hercreatinine improved. however , after restarting her medications her cragain bumped to 1.8. her ua was unremarkable. she was d/c home offlasix , lisinopril and colchicine with a cr of 1.8 presuming that she was still prerenal. the plan is for vna to check her chem7 in 3daysdays , results to go to dr. skibo for monitoring and deciding when torestart her medications.msk: pt developed the left forearm swelling and pain while in the hospfor the first night. a radiograph was negative for fracture and it wasfelt to be a small hematoma. the pain remitted with tylenol. atdischarge the pain was a dull ache , and the swelling was reduced.heme: anticoagulation. she was maintained on her home dose of inr wasmaintained in a theraputic range. this will have to be closelymonitored as an outpatient while on levofloxacin. her inr was 3 after 2days of levofloxacin and will be checked again by vna 3 daysafter discharge , results to be followed by sheldon dingmannendo: d.m. pt was switched from micronase to glipizide 2.5mg qd givenher worsening renal insufficiency. fingersticks remained in acceptablerange ( 100-148 ) during admission.dispo: to home
