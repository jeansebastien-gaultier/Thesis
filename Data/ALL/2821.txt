pciwith des to ostial svg-d1/om and des to proximal svg-d1/om.  hehas been on plavix 75 mg daily and full dose aspirin.  however,on tuesday, 10 days prior to presentation, the patient underwenta lithotripsy for kidney stones with placement of a ureteralstent and foley bag and his plavix was held.  he is currently 10days off plavix with his cardiologist and urologist both aware..the patient reports his current symptoms began this morning whenhe developed sudden onset, dull, substernal chest pain whilewalking at a leisurely pace at an automobile dealership.  thepain was associated with diaphoresis, and subsequently developednausea while being transported to the [hospital1 18] ed.  his symptomswere noted to be different than his prior anginal symptoms ofepigastric pain.  he presented to a fire station where they gavehim full dose aspirin and transported him to the [hospital1 18] ed.  thepatient reports he began developing radiating left arm pain andprecordial pain when he reached the ed.cardiology was consulted and recommended heparin gtt, plavixload, and nitro gtt titrated to pain. cardiac surgery wasconsulted for evaluation of coronary artery revascularization.past medical

have svg graft, pda, lad stenosis needingintervention.# chest pain/coronaries:  patient with cabg and des to svg-d1/omx2 most recently in [2138] now presenting with chest pain anddynamic ekg changes in the inferior and precordial leads.  thepatient's symptoms occurred subsequent to discontinuing plavix10 days ago for a lithotripsy.  initial set of ce's werenegative but subsequent up-trended with ck peak 691 and mb peak77.  he was on a heparin gtt and was plavix loaded, and hischest pain was controlled on a nitro gtt prior to cardiaccatheterization.  integrillin gtt and morphine iv prn werestarted prior to catheterization for recurrent chest painrefractory to up-titration of nitro gtt.  cardiaccatheterization [12-13] showed completely occluded svg-d1/om, 90%stenosis of svg-pda, known 90% lad stenosis just distal totouchdown.  he was recommended for cabg-redo and was continuedon heparin gtt and integrillin gtt post-cath with the plan ofcontinuing through until cabg-redo.  plavix was discontinued atthat time.  the patient had an acute drop in his platelets(described below) and integrillin gtt was discontinued.  shortlythereafter, he had a presyncopal episode on [12-16] during whichhe stood up, became pale, lightheaded, and developed mild leftsided chest pain.  vitals were stable but ekg showed new stdepressions in two leads, ce's negative.  he was transfused 1unit prbc for anemia (had previously refused transfusion) withresolution of symptoms but persistent st depressions on ekg.heparin gtt was discontinued but 5-h risk score for hit was lowand hit ab was negative.  the patient remained chest pain freeuntil cabg-redo on tue.#. thrombocytopenia:  patient developed severethrombocytopenia,secondary to integrillin.  although thepatient's thrombocytopenia occurred later than expected forintegrillin-induced thrombocytopenia, the precipitous drop andextended period of time he was on integrillin both support thisas the most likely etiology. plt dropped from 150->10 in 24 hrs.integrillin drip was stopped at 2pm on [12-15] and he has beengiven a total of 3 units of platelets.  hit antibody was alsosent which was negative.  5h hit risk score was also low, makingit less likely to be hit.  however, heparin gtt was discontinuedin the setting of profound thrombocytopenia given the patienthas been chest pain free.  in the setting of thrombocytopenia,he developed significant bleeding from around his foley catheterand recent lithotrypsy procedure, which was switched to a 3-wayfoley on cbi.  his hct has down-trended and he received a totalof 1 unit prbc on [12-16].  he was also given several platelettransfusions for the thrombocytopenia.  the anticipated plateletrecovery with integrillin-induced thrombocytopenia is 4 hours to5 days, and the patient's platelets slowly up-trended and by[12-19] he was in the 100s.# urine analysis:  patient with large blood, significantleukocytes, protein on ua likely [1-26] recent lithotripsy andureteral
