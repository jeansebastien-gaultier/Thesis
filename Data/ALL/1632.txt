epigastric pain and abnormal lfts (ast 466 alt 268).us and mrcp were reportedly normal. she was discharged withdiagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis. that evening, pt called her gidoctor complaining of severe abdominal pain, n/v, tremulousness.she presented to the ed and was re-admitted. she was noted to bejaundiced, groggy, with a protuberant abdomen. wbc was 13.8, k2.8, bili 7.7, ast 324, alt 370, alk phos 251, lipast 4877. toxscreen and etoh levels were negative. her abdomen becamedistended, tense, very tender, with no bowel sounds. she wastransferred to the icu for closer monitoring. she was treatedwith ivf and aggressive pain control with dilaudid 1mg iv q3.additionally she was sedated on precedex and an ativan drip at4mg/h. pt was intubated for airway protection on the morning of[10-14]. ct of the abdomen revealed enlarged indistinct pancreas,extensive peripancreatic fluid consistent with severepancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis, no loculated or drainablefluid collections

ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity sizeare normal. due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wallmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. left ventricularsystolic function is hyperdynamic (ef>75%). the estimatedcardiac index is high (>4.0l/min/m2). there is a mild restingleft ventricular outflow tract obstruction. right ventricularchamber size and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valveleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leafletexcursion. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aorticvalve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal imagequality. there is no valvular aortic stenosis. the increasedtransaortic velocity is likely related to increased strokevolume due to high cardiac output. no aortic regurgitation isseen. the mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. thereis no mitral valve prolapse. no masses or vegetations are seenon the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due tosuboptimal image quality. no masses or vegetations are seen onthe tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due tosuboptimal image quality. there is moderate pulmonary arterysystolic hypertension. there is an anterior space which mostlikely represents

course:# acute severe hemorrhagic pancreatitis: lipase was elevated to4788 at the osh. osh ct showed pancreatitis and concern forpancreatic necrosis. etoh pancreatitis is the most likelyetiology. she underwent mrcp at our hospital which demonstratedhemorrhagic, necrotic pancreatitis. patient was managedconservatively with aggressive fluid replacement. a surgeryconsult was obtained and did not advise any operative or irprocedures for the peripancreatic inflammation. she subsequentlydeveloped acute lung injury, bilat pleural effusions,anasarca,and ascites as a result of the severe pancreatitis. hercourse was complicated by vent associated pneumonia as well. shealso showed altered mental status during her icu stay related totoxic and metabolic encephalopathy. patient required insulinreplacement therapy while she was in the unit and on the floor.she was then transferred from the icu to the floor. there, shehad pt/ot, blood transfusion for anemia from hemorrhagicpancreatitis, and diuresis. before transfer to rehab she wasnoted to have significant and had cxr. this showed possibleloculated left upper lobe effusion. she underwent repeat ct ofthe chest on [2164-11-2] which showed moderate bilateral pleuraleffusions and anterior loculated left pleural effusion.  casewas discussed with interventional pulmonary service and giventhe patient's improving clinical status and lack of activeevidence of infection, they recommended not performing aparacentesis to evaluate the loculated effusion.  the patientwas educated to return if she develops fevers, rigors, sweats,worsening difficulty breathing..# altered mental status: her mental status was altered andrelated to toxic and metabolic encephalopathy. head imaging wasnegative (ct and mri)including eeg. she is back to normal mentalfunctioning after her prolonged and complicated course..# vap: sputum grew mssa (imipenem sensitive). she was initiallyon vancomycin and imipenem. vancomycin d/ced ([date range (1) 82010]). shewas transition ed from imipenem ([10-16] ?????? [10-22]) to nafcillin on[10-22], but imipenem was restarted again given decompensatingrespiratory status. ct chest on [10-26] was concerning forworsening multifocal pneumonia, so her antibiotics were changedfrom imipenem to vanco/zosyn. microbiology data has beennegative since [10-17]. 14 day course of antibiotics were completedon [10-30]. cough improved with expectorant and mucous clearingdevice. before transfer to rehab she was noted to havesignificant and had cxr. this showed possible loculated leftupper lobe effusion. she underwent repeat ct of the chest on[2164-11-2] which showed left anterior loculated effusion..# pulmonary edema/acute lung injury:  extubated [10-21] butemergently re-intubated [10-23] during event with svt andhypotension. patient was extubated again [10-25]. ct chest showedinterstitial changes and pleural effusions. bronchoscopy on [10-17]was wnl, and samples significant only for 2+ polys and staphaureus. she continued to receive to lasix with effectivediuresis..# svt: patient has prior h/o of afib. reportedly neveranticoagulated. episodes of svt appear to be precipitated bydiuresis. she was emergently re intubated on [10-23] during episodeof svt with hypotension that did not respond to electricalcardioversion. patient was loaded on amiodarone and remained innsr thereafter. cta was negative for pe. she was then placed onmaintenance dose of 200 mg /day. patient was also continued onhome dose of metoprolol..# horase voice: patient had traumatic intubation and continuesto have a hoarse voice. ent reports vocal cords functional andwill continue to take time to recover.plan for pt to f/u with ent in 2 wks after discharge..# rll nodule ?????? rll nodule appreciated on chest ct. this willrequire outpatient follow up in 10 - 30 days after discharge.pcp was notified on [2164-11-2]..# nasal skin necrosis possibly related to her icu stay. she wasseen by plastic surgery on [2164-11-2]. the necrosis is notinfected. they recommended local care and out patient follow upat their resident clinic....medications on admission:toprol xl 50 qdcelexa 80 qdlisinopril 40mg po qdhctz 25oxycodone 5 q6discharge medications:1. polyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % dropperette sig: [11-16]drops ophthalmic prn (as needed).2. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday) as needed.3. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q6h (every6 hours) as needed for fever.4. loperamide 2 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po tid (3 timesa day) as needed.5. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po hs (at bedtime) asneeded.6. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 ml syrup sig: 5-10 mls po q6h (every 6hours) as needed.7. white petrolatum-mineral oil 42.5-56.8 % ointment sig: one(1) appl ophthalmic prn (as needed).8. lorazepam 0.5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q8h (every 8hours) as needed for anxiety.9. lorazepam 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (at bedtime)as needed.10. lisinopril 20 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).11. metoprolol succinate 50 mg tablet sustained release 24 hrsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24 hr po daily (daily).12. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours).13. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution fornebulization sig: one (1)  inhalation q6h (every 6 hours).14. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1)  inhalationq6h (every 6 hours).15. amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).16. amlodipine 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily (daily).17. lasix 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day for 5days.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[location (un) 582] of [location (un) 620]discharge diagnosis:severe necrotizing haemorrhagic pancreatitisacute respiratoy failureacute lung injuryvapdischarge condition:stable.discharge instructions:you had severe necrotizing haemorrhagic pancreatitis resulted inrespiratoy failure, intubation, acute lung injury, lunginfection and anemia. we found a small lung lesion that needs tobe followed up with repeat ct of the chest once you recover.followup instructions:pcp: [name10 (nameis) ],[name11 (nameis) ] [name initial (nameis) ].
