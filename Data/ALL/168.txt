a hematocrit of 29.2. ckand troponins were negative. studies performed during heradmission , chest x-ray showed atelectasis. an echo prior toadmission showed mildly reduced ef , hypokinetic septum , lae ,dilated ra , and normal ar , 3+ mr , trace pr. a mibi performedduring this admission showed moderate aortic ischemia in theanterior wall and in the diagonal territory. chest x-ray on10/2/2006 , later on admission showed improved pulmonary edema ,slightly increased size of small effusions , and no infiltrate.she had a tee , which showed no clot and a mild-to-moderatedecreased ef. she had a tte with bubble study on 7/5/2006 ,which showed no shunt , and an ef of 45%. she had pfts , whichshowed a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture that wasmild-to-moderate in severity.hospital course:cardiovascular:1. rhythm: ms. prestage has a long history of atrial flutter ,which has been poorly controlled despite extremely high doses ofbeta-blockers , diltiazem , and digoxin. she underwent a tee anddc cardioversion and remained out of atrial flutter , and v pacedat 60 beats per minute for remainder of her admission.2. ischemia: she has a significant history of coronary arterydisease. after her dc cardioversion , she continued to complainof shortness of breath and was found to be hypoxic on room airwhich we discussed below. she did have the positive mibi asdiscussed above , but given her significant previousinterventions , the thought was to continue to manage hermedically since this would not likely be amenable to intervention.3. pump: in 2002 , she had an ef of 45 to 55%. she was not onany signs of decompensated chf , although her shortness of breathdid improve marginally with some gentle diuresis. a repeat tteon 7/5/2006 showed an ef of 45% , which was relatively unchangedfrom 2002.respiratory: status post her cardioversion , she was found to besaturating in the mid 80s on room air and desaturating further onambulation. pulmonary was consulted and a room air abg wasobtained that showed ph 7.48 , pco2 33 , and po2 52. she had noevidence of carbon monoxide , no methemoglobinemia. her pfts wereas described above. with a gentle diuresis and with moreambulation , she improved. it is unclear why she had this transienthypoxemia. pulmonary recommended a trial of advair and spiriva ,if these made her feel better to continue these , if not then shecould stop them. also mentioned , she underwent a bubble studywhich showed no shunt. in sum , there was a question as to whether this may berelated to atelectasis plus some underlyingcopd plus her underlying small effusion. she was scheduled tofollow up with pulmonary clinic after discharge.peripheral vascular disease: she has been improved since threeyears ago and she had a peripheral pci. she
