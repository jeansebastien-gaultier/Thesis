:post-infarction angina pectoris .associated diagnosis :chronic renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure , diabetes mellitus , carotid and peripheral vascular disease , hypertension , pernicious anemia , hypothyroidism , atrial flutter .special procedures and operations :coronary artery bypass grafting on 8-28-92 .other procedures :gated blood pool scan on 9-3-92 , renal scan on 8-27-92 , renal ultrasound 8-27-92 ; carotid ultrasound 8-26-92 .history of present illness :the patient is a 78 year old male who was admitted to pre health on 8-19-92 with a complaint of chest pain .he ruled in for a non-q wave myocardial infarction and underwent cardiac catheterization .this revealed a normal left main , a 60-80% diffuse stenosis with diffuse disease of the left anterior descending , a 90-100% stenosis of the circumflex and an occluded right coronary artery .he was noted at the time of cardiac catheterization to have inferolateral and anteroseptal hypokinesis , with an ejection fraction of 30% and a wedge of 10 .his hospitalization at abo healthcare was complicated by a single hypotensive event , responsive to fluids .he was transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital on 8-24-92 for evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting .past medical history :remarkable for coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism , iron deficiency anemia , atrial fibrillation , hiatus hernia , gastritis , carpal tunnel syndrome , asbestos exposure , and bilateral cataract surgery .medications on admission :1. verapamil 80 mg po t.i.d. ,2. nitrostat 0.4 mg sublingual prn ,3. isordil 20 mg po q.i.d. ,4. nph insulin 24 units subcutaneously qa.m. ,5. ferrous sulfate , 325 mg po q.day ,6. levothyroid , 0.125 mg po q.day ,7. reglan 10 mg po q.day ,8. zantac 150 mg po b.i.d. ,9. vitamin b and folate injections .allergies :the patient has no known drug allergies .physical examination :on physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain .his vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .the carotids were without bruits .crackles were heard two thirds of the way up of the lung base on the right and one half the way up on the left .cardiovascular exam :s3 and s4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .the point of maximal impulse was not palpable .the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .the rectal examination was unremarkable .extremities :within normal limits .the neurological examination was unremarkable .laboratory data :included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , bun and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 .the urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells .admission chest x-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm .the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic t 's in i , iv , v1 and t2 .st depression and biphasic t 's were noted in v3 through v6 .no q waves were noted .picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .he underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right pica stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .he also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .the renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .the impression of the renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .no evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .on 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .mr. ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the cardiology , renal , and diabetes and cardiac surgery services .the patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the surgical intensive care unit .he did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 's and was placed on captopril , 6.25 mg po t.i.d.his blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his captopril was discontinued .his renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his bun and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .dr. freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient 's acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .on the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit to the regular floor , without incident .he did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures .the patient is being transferred to nacalv medical center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well .his saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his stitches and staples will remain in to be removed during his postoperative office visit .medications on discharge :nph 12 units and regular czi 25 units qa.m. , czi sliding scale prn , digoxin .125 mg po q.day , ecotrin , 1 po q.day , ferrous sulfate 325 mg po t.i.d. , folate 1 mg po q.day , reglan 10 mg po t.i.d. , synthroid 0.5 mg po q.day , lasix 40 mg po q.day , potassium chloride prn .dr. kotekeese , the patient 's diabetes consultant , noted that the patient 's morning regular insulin was new , and suggested that a premixed nph regular 70/30 insulin might prove to be appropriate for him .the patient 's diet is a no added salt / no concentrated sweets diet .followup :the patient is to follow up with dr. bun and with dr. shufffyfe .lenni bun , m.d.tr :gw / bmotdd :9-9-92td :09/09/92cc :dr. ethelan bun dr. dao kotekeese dr. izietapar freiermthalskush dr. lenni bun fax a copy to sylv health
