was taken that revealed pulmonary edema. stated he hadbeen complaining of shortness of breath over the month prior toadmission with no dyspnea on exertion or chest pain. while inthe emergency department , he had respiratory distress with o2oxygen saturations 69%. an echocardiogram was done at that time.it was significant for showing evidence of a dehiscence of thebioprosthetic aortic valve with prolapse into the leftventricular outflow tract. it was noted that there is at leastmoderate perivalvular aortic regurgitation. it also noted mitralvalve had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. as statedpreviously , he was admitted to the cardiac surgical service forrepair/replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.past medical history:includes hypertension , diabetes

consistent with congestive heart failure.brachiocephalic and right subclavian stents were in place.hospital coursebrief operative note:date of surgery , 2/13/05.preoperative diagnosis:see magna valve three months prior. epl on echo showed grosslymobile on the stable aortic valve prosthesis moderate , mr. novegetations.procedure:reoperation of ascending aortic dissection , aortic valvereplacement , #24 homograph , mvp with alfieri suture.bypass time:355 minutes ,crossclamp time:265 minutes.one ventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternaltube , two left pleural tubes and two right pleural tubes wereplaced.findings:dense inflammatory edematous scar tissue throughout pericardium ,especially periaortic. right axillary cannulation with 6 mmhemashield side. percutaneous right cf decannulation.uneventful re-sternotomy.previous svg pda injured during dissection , repaired withinterrupted 7-0 prolene. aortic valve prosthesis dehisced 3/4 ofcircumference with question of an abscess cavity near lcc/rccjunction. debridement , the annulus is of extensive inflammatorytissue. previous dacron aortic root patch removed due to pocketof pus on the anterior aspect. no. 24 allograft placed withdouble layer proximal suture line. svg and both coronaryarteries implanted as buttons. distal suture line continuous 4-0prolene. transaortic and mitral valves replaced.after the operation , the patient was transferred to the cardiacintensive care unit in stable condition. his postoperativecourse was complicated by the following:1. infectious disease: although , mr. ownbey had multiple bloodcultures , sent , they all proved to be negative as of the date ofdischarge. although mr. cavitt was never felt to be bacteremic ,the cultures that were sent from the operating room were of theaortic valve prosthesis. this never showed the organismsidentified on gram stain and mssa stain. however , the infectiousdisease physicians were consulted and felt that mr. sanjurjo shouldbe on vancomycin , rifampin , and gentamicin. as at the time ofdischarge , mr. bersamin has finished his regimen of gentamicin andwill continue to be on both vancomycin and rifampin until1/3/04. the rifampin he will take orally and the vancomycin hewill get after dialysis three times a week. while an inpatient ,mr. rakus never had any evidence of leukocytosis or bacteremia.2. cardiovascular: ms. johe was noted to have a first-degreeav block on postoperative day #7 with a pr interval of 0.35. upinto this point he had been receiving labetalol. this was heldand the electrophysiology consult was obtained. theelectrophysiology service saw the patient agreed to be anexcellent candidate for permanent pacemaker. initially theyattempted to gain access to the right brachiocephalic/subclavian.however , this proved to be difficult and ultimately obtainaccess through the left iliac. his permanent pacemaker wasplaced on 1/29/05 and was interrogated the following day andfelt to be functioning appropriately. he was restarted on hislabetalol and as of the time of discharge , has had no symptoms.other than the above , ms. dingman was weaned from his oxygenrequirement , mobilized rapidly following surgery. all epicardialpacing wires and chest tubes were removed without complication.he will be discharged home on the following medications aspirin325 mg p.o. daily , hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , labetalol100mg p.o. t.i.d. , lisinopril 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. , oxycodone 5 mg p.o.6 hours p.r.n. pain , rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. , vancomycin forwhich he will receive following dialysis until 5/14/05 , zocor 40mg p.o. q.h.s. , losartan 100 mg p.o. daily. mr. llanez willfollow up with dr. owston , cardiac surgeon , in six weeks , and dr.geister , cardiologist , in three to four weeks , dr. kmiecik , thepatient's primary care physician , in one to two weeks and dr.vaught , cardiologist , in two weeks.escription document: 3-6323131 emssten teldictated by: ortman
