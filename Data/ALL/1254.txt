record date: 2074-07-05      july 05, 2074  paul arteaga, m.d.loma linda community hospital89 caldwell roadshady cove,  ny  63363 re:  christine olivier     mr #652-33-21-5 dear dr. arteaga: mrs. olivier presented to the office today for a second opinionregarding her current cardiac condition.  as her history is wellknown to you, i will repeat it briefly for our records.  mrs.olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history ofcoronary artery disease.  after several catheterizations in the2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in july of 2071showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which shewas managed medically.  however, she suffered a non-q wavemyocardial infarction on february of 2072 at which time sheunderwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronaryartery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronarybypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery toher lad and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her pda, d1 and obtusemarginal branch.  she underwent repeat catheterization in februaryof 2073 at the comfrey clinic which showed diffuse native diseasebut apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  sheunderwent repeat cardiac catheterization in may of 2074 because ofa current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%proximal lad stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosiswith no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branchand a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  the saphenousvein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significantstenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graftto the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was thesaphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  the leftintramammary artery to the lad was a small vessel without discretestenoses.  left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area ofposterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. she therefore was transferred to the midwest eire centerin early june where she underwent successful ptca of her vein graftto her diagonal artery.  she tolerated this uneventfully and was   olivier, christinemr #652-33-21-5                    -2-            july 05, 2074 discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chestdiscomfort.  her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mildexertional dyspnea.  she has undergone extensive pulmonaryevaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests whichhave revealed an fev1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an fvc of1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistentwith restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  inaddition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.   medications at present:  nph insulin 60 units sub q qam, cziinsulin 30 units sub q qam, nph insulin 60 units sub q qpm, entericcoated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., captopril25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg poq.d., nitroglycerin prn, nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of atwenty-four hour period, neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,trusopt one drop ou q.d., alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterolinhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn. cigarettes - none at present.   physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman inno acute distress.  blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heartrate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172pounds.  the neck is supple.  jvp flat.  carotids are 2+ withoutsignificant bruits.  chest is clear with a trace right basilarrhonchi.  cardiac exam shows a normal s1, physiologically split s2and a i-ii/vi systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex tothe base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  the abdomen isbenign with bowel sounds well heard.  extremities withoutappreciable edema.  peripheral pulses are intact.  there is 1+bipedal edema.  electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  pr intervalof .14, qrs .08, qt .34, axis -20 degrees.  there is evidence of aleft atrial abnormality and poor r wave progression in leads v1through v3.   impression:  mrs. olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modestexertional dyspnea and fatigue.  she denies any active chestdiscomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful atalleviating the chest pain syndrome.  the records available to meindicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her betablocker therapy however in the past this had lead to anexacerbation of her angina.  however, now that she is status posther ptca it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blockerreduction and therefore, i suggested she decrease her atenolol to50 mg po q.d.  she will have her blood pressure checked within thenext several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, i will  olivier, christinemr #652-33-21-5                    -3-            july 05, 2074 also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheraledema and in part because she may no longer need this.  otherwise,i have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen exceptto encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best shecan and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay inclose contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. i would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deemappropriate. sincerely yours,   irineo tovar, m.d.vereen memorial hospital25 waverly stcolorado city,  ny  88736 dd: 07/05/74dt: 07/11/74dv: 07/05/74 /outlaw     approved but not reviewed by attending provider
