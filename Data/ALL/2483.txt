it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  mrs. doss continues to do well.  she reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  she continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a nstemi during her last hospitalization.  she has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  finally, she informs me that an appointment with dr. yuhas of neurosurgery has been scheduled for august in order to follow up an incidental small l a2 aneurysm.  mrs. doss continues to take plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has g6pd deficiency).  her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  however, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  she continues to tolerate her dilantin well; there had been a question in april about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  she denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  she reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  she denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  she does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  she sometimes feels as though she has "creepy crawly things in my head," a sensation similar to when she had a mohs procedure.  meds:  atenolol 50mg po qdaylipitor 80mg po qdayclopidogrel 75mg po qdayglipizide 5mg po qdaycozaar 100mg po qdaymetformin 500mg po biddilantin 200mg qam / 300mg qpmvaltrex prnacyclovir ointmentphysical examination:ms:       alert, appropriately interactive, normal affect.  speech fluent w/o paraphasic/dysarthric errors.  follows all commands.  cn:                i:                not assessed               ii:               vff to confrontation. perrl 4 mm &#224;

ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  mrs. doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose lipitor and dietary changes.  her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  i have also written her a letter certifying that, as of july 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of dilantin.  she emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the emergency department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  if she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  although the incidentally noted l a2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on cta, i have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with neurosurgery, as i do not see the date noted in the computer.  finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular r ica plaque has not progressed.  of note, dr. franklin feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. i will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   sincerely, yasmine florence-gagnon, mdeducare-pullman neurology
