male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .history of present illness :the patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .he was admitted to the utal health in 12/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .he was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by dr. kennedy with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to om of the left circumflex .the vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .in the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with procainamide .he has had numerous interval admissions to shoreale medical health for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in 03/93 and 08/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .he has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .his primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .he often takes nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .he also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .he was recently seen in outpatient clinic by dr. carbon , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .his procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on amiodarone .however , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .the night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .he took nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .the morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .he came to the emergency room for evaluation .in the emergency room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% o2 saturation .he was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .past medical history :iron deficiency anemia .hypertension .urosepsis in 1982 .peptic ulcer disease , resulting in gastrectomy .a 65% stenosis of his proximal right internal carotid artery in 12/92 .cataract surgery in his righteye .a 2.5-cm. abdominal aortic aneurysm which was recently sizedat 3.5 cm .allergies :shellfish , which causes nausea and vomiting .social history :smoker for greater than 100 pack years ( 3-1/2 packs per day x 35 years ) .no ethanol history .family history :negative for diabetes , hypertension , or coronary artery disease .review of systems :otherwise nonfocal .admission medications :digoxin 0.25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. coumadin 7.5 mg. p.o. q. d. captopril 25 mg. p.o. q.i.d. lasix 160 mg. in the morning and 80 mg. at night .atenolol 25 mg. p.o. q. a.m. k-tab 20 meq. t.i.d. nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n. procainamide , recently discontinued .isordil 10 mg. p.o. t.i.d.physical examination :he was a moderately obese man in acute respiratory distress .blood pressure was 154/90 in the right and 150/82 in the left .pulse was varying between 120 and 140 .he was afebrile .his respiratory rate was 20 .saturation was 98% in room air .on heent exam , pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light and accommodation .extraocular movements were intact .he had a furrowed tongue , but hisoropharynx was otherwise negative .he had no carotid bruits with good bilateral upstroke .his jvp was difficult to assess with a questionable meniscus near the ear at 45 degrees .cardiac exam revealed an irregular rate .the pmi was anteriorly displaced in the mid clavicular line with an anterior heave .heart sounds were distant and difficult to separate secondary to rate .an s2 split was not appreciated .there were no murmurs .there was no apparent s3 .chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .abdomen was obese .abdominal exam revealed surgical scars and questionable hepatojugular reflux .liver was 10 cm. in width , 2 to 3 cm. below the rib .rectal exam was heme negative .extremities were warm with good distal pulses .neurologic exam was non focal .cranial nerves ii through xii were grossly intact .finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were normal .reflexes were less than 1+ symmetrically .laboratory data :on admission , hematocrit was 40 , white count 7.18 , platelets 250 , sodium 138 , potassium 4.2 , bun 31 , creatinine 1.5 .digoxin level was 1.3 .the inr was 2.5 , ptt 38.8 .electrocardiogram :the electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable p-r interval , qrs of 0.09 , and qtc of 0.42 .his axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .assessment and plan :in summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .he was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on amiodarone and diuresis .hospital course :he was loaded on amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .a right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .his left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to om was not detected by the aortic root shot .the ejection fraction was not calculated .a swan-ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .the swan-ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .during this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin , intravenous metoprolol , and morphine .there were no ekg changes during these episodes .on 3/22 , after an appropriate load of amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .there were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .he was reloaded back upon coumadin and reached a therapeutic inr .he was discharged on march 24th with follow-up of his pt / ptt values on friday , the 25th , as well as three times a week in the following week , and follow-up with dr. most within two weeks .discharge medications :amiodarone 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for
