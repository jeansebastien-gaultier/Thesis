bacteremia.hospital course by issue:1. infectious disease:a. enterobacter pneumonia: the patient completed a 14-daycourse of imipenem for enterobacter pneumonia. chest ct on5/6/05 showed resolving pneumonia. sputum culture from11/0/06 , revealed enterobacter and mrsa. the sputum culturesthrough 8/12/06 showed persistent enterobacter. as the patientwas persistently febrile and repeat ct showed
