onanticoagulation, copd, recently admitted for new pe, readmittedfor multifocal pna, who developed a large abdominal wallhematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections.# multifocal pneumonia: she was admitted with multifocalpneumonia. she was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  shecompleted a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  mrsa was found togrow in her sputum so she was continued on a 14 day course ofvancomycin. she originally presented with elevated wbc count andleft shift which quickly resolved with the initiation ofantibiotics.  her productive cough improved as well and sheremained on her baseline home o2 of 2l.  approximately 4 daysafter completion of her 14 day course of vancomycin, the patientdeveloped worsening cough, sob, and upper respiratory symptoms.a repeat cxr showed evidence of a new consolidation in the rll.the patient was started back on levofloxacin/flagyl.  vancomycinwas added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2/4 bottleswith gpc in clusters and chains.  additionally, her sputumculture grew out gnrs.  levofloxacin was discontinued andmeropenem was started for concern for pseudomonas given thepatient's long hospital course.  her o2 sat remained stable93-100% on 2l nasal cannula (which is her baseline).  she wasgiven mucomyst inhaled nebulizers to assist in breaking up thicksputum.  her gnrs in the sputum grew out e. coli.  because ofthe sensitivity profile of the e. coli and the patient's allergyto penicillin and cephalosporins, the patient was continued onmeropenem.  her gpcs were found to grow out coag negative staph. surveillance cultures had no further growth and the coagnegative staph was thought to likely be a contaminant.  hervancomycin was discontinued.  she will continue a 14 day courseof meropenem and she was discharged with a picc to complete thiscourse..# pulmonary embolism/dvts: she has had multiple pes and has hadone even since the placement of a trapease ivc filter. ct duringrecent previous hospitalization revealed appropriate location offilter and cta on this admission showed improvement of clot.admission labwork revealed an inr of 7.9.  coumadin was thusheld and reversed with ffp and vitamin k given her history ofgib on anticoagulation.  in the interim, therapeutic lovenoxinjections were initiated, but within days of starting, shedeveloped a large abdominal wall hematoma near to lovenoxinjection site.  once her hematocrit stabilized, she was startedon a heparin gtt with coumadin overlap.  while [last name (namepattern4) 9533] hercoumadin with an inr 1.2, she was found to have a large hct dropand a ct scan of the abdomen showed a new rectus hematoma.  shewas subsequently transferred to the micu for closer monitoring.it was decided after her second hematoma while onanticoagulation, the risks of anticoagulation outweigh thebenefits at this time and she was not anticoagulated.  in termsof her hypercoagulable workup, it has been negative thus far forhyperhomocysteinemia, factor v leiden and antiphospholipidantibody. malignancy workup included a colonoscopy and egd aswell as cea, all of which were within normal limits. speprevealed hypogammaglobulinemia, but was otherwise unremarkable.during her hospital course, she also began to complain ofworsening lower extremity pain.  lenis were obtained whichshowed evidence of extensive, completely occlusive, bilateraldeep venous thrombi extending from the common femoral veins tothe popliteal veins.  radiology felt that these clots were mostlikely acute to subacute in nature.  in this setting,hematology/oncology saw the patient again to consider the risksvs benefits of anticoagulation.  antithrombin iii, prothrombinmutation, lupus anticoagulation and [location (un) 1169] venom viper weresent to reevaluate the reason for her hypercoagulability.  thehematology/oncology team still felt that the risks ofcoagulation outweigh the potential benefits given that thepatient has had multiple bleeding episodes in the setting ofanticoagulation.# abdominal wall hematoma: as mentioned above, she developed alarge left-sided abdominal wall hematoma from a lovenoxinjection site that caused a significant hct drop (originally28.1-->19.4).  despite the drop, she remained hemodynamicallystable (has sinus tachycardia at baseline prior to bleed). shereceived 3 units prbcs, 4 units ffp. her hematocrit thenstabilized and once stable, she was restarted on heparin gtt.coumadin was re-initiated and heparin gtt was continued whileawaiting her inr to become therapeutic.  while [location (un) 9533] hercoumadin with an inr 1.2, she was found to have another hct drop(25.9-> 22.2) and a ct scan of the abdomen showed a newright-sided rectus hematoma.  she was subsequently transferredto the micu for closer monitoring.  she was given 1 unit ffp and9 units prbcs between [date range (1) 39125] until her hematocrit becamestable and she bumped appropriately to transfusion.  it wasdecided after her second hematoma while on anticoagulation, therisks of anticoagulation outweigh the benefits at this time andshe was not anticoagulated.  she has complained of [6-16]abdominal pain with movement and has maintained stablehematocrits.  her pain is most likely [3-11] to the large rectushematoma that will resolve over time.  her hct remained stableafter her anticoagulation was discontinued.# thoracic mass:  ct chest and abdomen revealed a stablethoracic mass (stable x 3years) and thought potentiallyconsistent with neural cyst.  it was not further evaluated bymri given its long term stability and also she has metalhardware in place s/p elbow surgery and facial plates.  itshould be followed up with imaging to ensure it remainsunchanged in the future.# ? zoster:  patient reports having a history of "herpes" on herright buttock.  during her stay, she developed a tingling,itchiness and multiple small erythematous skin lesions on herright buttock over the s2, s3 dermatomal distribution.  therewere no vesicles appreciated.  she was treated with acyclovir.# candidal vaginitis:  treated with fluconazole x 2 withresolution of symptoms.# h/o gi bleeding during recent admission: recent colonoscopyshowed diverticulosis with no active signs of bleeding.  she hadno blood in her stools during this admission even whileanticoagulated.  her stools were guiac-ed multiple times andwere found to be guiac negative.# constipation: she is constipated at baseline and requiresdaily scheduled bowel regimen to maintian regularity.# hyperlipidemia: continued on lipitor.# depression/sad: continued on prozac, risperdone, wellbutrin,and klonopin.# ulcerative colitis: remains in remission.  she was continuedon mesalamine.# orthostatic hypotension: she remained
