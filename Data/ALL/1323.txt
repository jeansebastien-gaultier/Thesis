is a 72-year-old man with a history ofsignificant coronary artery disease , status postcabg x 2 , stents and brachytherapy who was admitted for an nsvtleading to fatigue and shortness of breath.history of present illness: the patient's symptoms first developedlast september , 2002 when he noticedfatigue and shortness of breath. he had recently developedbacteremia after a colonoscopy and never felt that he had quiterecovered. he was being treated with atenolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. atthe time for his coronary artery disease. his wife and son , whoare a nurse and a pa , respectively , felt his pulse and it wasfrequently in the 30s , but was also occasionally normal. hedecreased his atenolol to 25 mg once a day but his symptomspersisted. he was seen as an outpatient and found to have frequentpvcs on ekg.over the past few months the patient has also noticed increasedangina , both with and without activity. he has had increaseddifficulty walking up the stairs causing chest pain and shortnessof breath that are relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. then twodays prior to admission the patient also noticed pain at rest butwas again relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. on the morning ofadmission he felt chest heaviness that woke him up from sleep. hedid not take any nitroglycerin but his wife told him that he was"gasping for breath". over the past month he had been seeing hiscardiologist , dr. verdun . because of his shortness of breath hewas started on lasix for 3-4 days but this also did not relieve hissymptoms. he had holter monitoring with exercise , going up anddown the stairs , at clinic and this also showed frequent pvcs. hehad an electrocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 30%.past medical history:1. he had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1974 and 1982. he hadpci of his left main coronary artery 6/18 and ptca andbrachytherapy secondary to in-stent restenosis in april , 2002.intervention 6/18 his left main was radiated. his bypassvessels are lima/lad , svg/marginal 1 , lima/lad , svg/rpda.2. he had a significant gi bleed secondary to aspirin andplavix in 2002. his hematocrit went to 17. the patient hasremained on aspirin and plavix secondary to his coronaryartery disease.3. history of prostate cancer treated with radiation , complicatedby radiation prostatitis.4. diabetes.5. status post right carotid endarterectomy. no history of tiasor strokes.allergies: no known drug allergies.medications on admission: aspirin 81 mg; plavix 75 mg; atenolol 25mg once a day; isordil 60 mg twice aday; lisinopril 20 mg once a day; norvasc 5 mg once a day; lipitor10 mg once a day; gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day; hydroxyzine 25 mgtwice a day; glyburide 10 mg twice a day; metformin 1 , 000 mg twicea day; nexium 40 mg once a day; iron sulfate 300 mg once a day;calcium 1250 twice a day; multivitamin once a day; vitamin e; folicacid; colace.family history: he has several siblings with coronary arterydisease in their 60s.social history: he is a former engineer for ssand lare , butstopped working when he was in his 40s because ofhis coronary artery disease. he denies any tobacco , alcohol , ordrug use. he lives with his wife.review of systems: two-pillow orthopnea that is stable , nopalpitations.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 95.1 , heart rate58 , blood pressure 112/50 , breathing 22 ,satting 98% on room air. heent: extraocular movements intact.pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. jvpwas 10.0 cm with a right carotid endarterectomy scar.cardiovascular: normal s1s2. lungs: clear to auscultationbilaterally. abdomen: soft , nontender , nondistended , positivebowel sounds. extremities: no lower extremity edema. neuro:cranial nerves ii-xii intact.laboratory data: on admission. sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 ,chloride 104 , bicarb 23 , bun 35 , creatinine 1.5his baseline is 1.4 , glucose 148 , white count 9.0 , hematocrit 37 ,platelets 297. liver function tests were within normal limits. ck125 , mb 1.6 , troponin 0.02.electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and 2-3 beats ofnormal sinus rhythm interspersed with nsvt.hospital course: 1 ) cardiovascular: ischemia: it was unclearwhether the patient's worsening chest pain wasfrom progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this wasdemand ischemia from his frequent nsvt. he was ruled out for amyocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of hisarrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. his catheterizationshowed an lad 100% lesion , diag 1 80% lesion , left circumflex 100%lesion , the ramus was widely patent , rca showed a 100% lesion ,right pda 100% lesion. overall , his lima graft to the lad waswidely patent , his svg graft to marginal 1 and svg graft to rcawere both occluded but had collaterals. what was new from hisprevious catheterization was disease in his pda. it was determinedto further treat the patient's coronary artery disease with medicalmanagement. after his heart rate was controlled with amiodaroneand with a pacemaker , he did however continue to have some fatigueand shortness of breath. as a result he had an adenosine mibi toevaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on hiscatheterization. the mibi showed a moderate sized perfusion defectthroughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateralwalls showing a moderate amount of reversibility. his ejectionfraction was estimated at 50% with akinesis of the inferior andinferoseptal walls with reduced thickening. he did not have anyekg changes during the procedure. his beta blockade was increasedto lopressor 50 b.i.d. and he continued on his nitrates. he wasactually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain orshortness of breath. it is possible that the symptoms that he hadlater on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overloadwhich responded well to diuresis. he will follow up with dr.rafi . it is unlikely that any intervention will be able to bedone but he will explore this as an outpatient.2 ) pump: the patient did experience some shortness of breathseveral days into his admission. he had been approximately fourliters positive over several days. he was given 20 mg of iv lasixand responded well. he was sent home with 20 mg of lasix q. mondayand thursday.3 ) rhythm: the patient's electrocardiogram and telemetry stripswere concerning because while he was technically in normal sinusrhythm , he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beats ata time at most , and in between that , had several runs of nsvt. thensvt never progressed to sustained v-tac and the patient was alwayshemodynamically stable. however , there was concern that this couldultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. hewas loaded on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. which he toleratedwell. he also required an additional 150 mg iv x 1 load tostabilize his rhythm. he had an icd and ddi pacemaker placed on7/26 without complication. after the pacemaker was placed he wasstill experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may havebeen overpaced. as a result his settings were adjusted to increasehis av delayed 240 and he was changed to ddd mode. he also had anumber of beats shortened that would be required to detect the vt ,to 24. by the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to400 mg q.d. this may ultimately be decreased even further to 200but will be decided by dr. swymer .4 ) endocrinology: the patient has a history of diabetes. we heldhis metformin on admission because of his catheterization butrestarted it upon discharge. any elevated blood sugars werecovered with an insulin sliding scale.5 ) pulmonary: as mentioned above the patient did have someshortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload. heresponded well to 20 mg iv lasix. he always maintained his oxygensaturations. he will have pulmonary function tests as anoutpatient to establish a baseline given his new treatment withamiodarone.6 ) heme: the patient does have a history of a gi bleed on aspirinand plavix. we monitored his hematocrit closely. he came in at37. it did decrease to 31. during his hospitalization he had anepisode of bright red blood per rectum. given his history ofradiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that hehad this. he always remained hemodynamically stable and did notrequire any transfusions. at baseline his hematocrit is probablycloser to 33 and it is likely that the 37 was an elevation fromdecreased p.o. intake. follow up stools were guaiac-negative.followup: he will follow up as an outpatient with dr. halvorson andfabus on 4/4/03 . he will also have pulmonaryfunction tests on 5/8 .discharge medications: amiodarone 400 mg p.o.q.d.; aspirin 81 mgp.o.q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 p.o.b.i.d.; colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; iron sulfate 300 q.d.; folate400 mcg q.d.; gemfibrozil 600 b.i.d.; glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.;hydroxyzine 25
