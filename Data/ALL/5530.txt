plan75 yo woman with a history of stroke, htn who presents with l arm numbness. while her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of dwi hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. these strokes are in the pca region and at the watershed region of the mca/pca and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.- has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing- would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi- would also benefit from repeat holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- admit to internal medicine service__________________________________victor q. qiu, mdneurology ed consultpager 64012patient discussed with senior resident dr. bates who agrees with the plan.
