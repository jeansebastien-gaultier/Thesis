female with acute onset thyrombocytopenia and sepsislikely secondary to renal infarction and pyelonephritis.1) sirs/sepsis: patient initially presented with left flankpain, tachycardia, low wbc, and low platelets. based on oshnon-contrast ct scan it appeared this was consistent withpyelonephritis. she was started on cefepime, flagyl andvancomycin [9-19]. with concern for worsening abdominal pain arepeat contrast abdominal and pelvic ct was performed. it showedsevere acute left pyelonephritis with marked renal edema andevolving foci of hypoperfusion, parenchymal necrosis,inflammatory phlegmon or early abscess formation.  urology wasconsulted given concern for a need for acute surgicalmanagement.  they suggested a concern for renal vein/arterythrombosis due to the appearance of multifocal necrosis in thekidney.  mri revealed no acute thrombosis but was suggestive ofan acute infarction involving much of the upper pole andinterpolar region of the left kidney without being able to ruleout coexistent pyelonephritis.  the patient's white counteventually trended up from a nadir of 2.5 to the 9's and she wastransitioned from cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole tooral ciprofloxacin.  all cultures remained negative but she didcomplete a fourteen day course of antibiotics for a suspectedpyelonephritis.  vasculitis was also considered as an etiologyfor her sirs but no clear evidence for a particular syndrome wasfound.  her blood pressures stabilized and she was completelyhemodynamically stable for > 1 wk prior to discharge.  she didremain febrile despite negative cultures, which was thought mostlikely due to inflammation secondary to her necrotic kidney.prior to discharge her fever curve had been trending down andshe did not become more febrile after antibiotics were stopped.cultures similarly remained negative.  repeat mri of kidney wasobtained to look for an abscess or closed space infection andwas negative.2) left renal infarcts: given patient's family history of factorv leiden mutation there was some concern that she could have athrombophilia predisposing her to clot. agitated saline tterevealed a pfo, which raised concern for paradoxicalembolization but work up for vte was unremarkable.  severepyelonephritis could also cause renal infarction but as reportedabove cultures never impressively reenforced a pyelonephritis.similarly septic emboli were thought extremely unlikely givenpersistently negative blood cultures.  investigation for factorv leiden mutation was negative and no clear reason forhypercoagulability was found.  the patient was neverthelessanticoagulated as the benefits of anticoagulation were felt tooutweigh the risks.  therefore, she was started on coumadin anddischarged on this as well as enoxaparin for bridge as she wasnot yet therapeutic.  renal function remained essentially stableafter the patient was hydrated on her day of presentation.  thepatient will follow up in hematology for furtherhypercoagulability work-up.3) thrombocytopenia:  the patient was transferred partially dueto concern for dic or ttp due to her thrombocytopenia.hematology/oncology was consulted and thought  low plateletswere not consistent with dic or ttp and she did not havediagnostic numbers of schistocytes or a low fibrinogen.  mostlikely etiology of her thrombocytopenia was thought to be marrowsuppression secondary to sirs/sepsis.  ultimately her plateletcount recovered and was normal at the time of discharge.  shedid receive one unit of platelets during an ij placement.4)pulmonary edema/pleural effusions: initial cxr showedpulmonary edema with a small pleural effusion. a bnp was 6587.an echocardiogram was performed with concern for cardiovascularcompromise and it showed a normal ejection fraction, normal wallmotion, and 1+mr. it was felt the patient's pulmonary edema andeffusions were secondary to fluid resuscitation.  she had oneepisode of desaturation to 88% when she laid flat in her ctscan. she intermittently required 2 liters nc for comfort. herdifficulty breathing was felt to be due to her abdominal paincausing pain upon deep inspiration and fluid overload. her painwas controlled and patient was auto-diuresing >150cc/hr upontransfer to the floor. she continued to auto-diurese on thefloor and eventually came off of oxygen entirely.  better paincontrol significantly improved her respiratory function andprior to discharge her pulmonary exam was normal and she wasambulating without desaturations.  ct showed a persistent,loculated pleural effusion, and given persistent fevers, athoracentesis was attempted but as the effusion was steadilydecreasing in size interventional pulmonology and interventionalradiology thought it was too small to drain safely.  as itcontinued to decrease in size and the patient wbc count andfevers were down trending this was not pursued further.5) abdominal pain: this was initially controlled with morphineand morphine sr.  she appeared to be very drowsy and her rrdecreased on this regimen, so the ms contin was discontinued.she continued to have significant pain, so a morphine pca,maximum dose of 4 mg/hr, that was started and the patient's painimproved significantly. it was assessed that her pain wasconsistent with post-embolization syndrome, which includesfever, abdominal pain secondary to the clearance process ofnecrotic tissue.  eventually she was reestablished on a regimenof morphine sr, morphine ir, and gabapentin with goodimprovement in her pain.  she will likely need these for thenext few months as her body clears necrotic tissue from herkidney.6) persistent sinus tachycardia: the patient informs us that shehas exhibited fast heart rates for years.  the patient did notappear volume down as her cvp remained high. it was felt thatthe tachycardia was due to pain, fever and the overall stressresponse of sepsis. the tachycardia improved to the low 100safter the administration of the pca and remained there throughthe day of discharge.7) gerd: ppi held in setting of decreased plts. ranitidine [hospital1 ]started and then discontinued when platelet count recovered asit was thought this was no longer indicated.the patient had a picc for iv access that was discontinued priorto discharge.  she was tolerating a full diet prior todischarge.  she was full code.medications on admission:neurotin 300 qam,

diagnosis:renal infarctions of unclear significance? pyelonephritispatent foramen ovalepleural effusiondischarge condition:stabledischarge instructions:you were admitted to the hospital with back pain and were foundto have had injuries due to poor blood flow to parts of yourkidney.  it is unclear exactly why this occurred but we suspectyou may have some predisposition toward forming blood clots.therefore, you have been started on blood thinners to preventfuther such events.  you have been started on coumadin as a longterm blood thinner, you are being discharged on enoxaparin, ablood thinner, while we await your coumadin level to betherapeutic.  you will need to see a hematologist as anoutpatient to complete your clotting disorder workup.you had fevers in the hospital.  because of the imaging findingsin your kidney we could not rule out a kidney infection.therefore, you received 14 days of therapy for a presumed kidneyinfection.  you completed this prior to discharge.  yourcontinued fevers and pain are likely due to an inflammatoryreaction as your body breaks down the portions of kidney tissuethat died.  you can take acetaminophen for these fevers asneeded.  unfortunately, this inflammatory reaction also causespain, which we have treated with multiple pain medicines.you will need follow up with a primary care provider andcoumadin clinic to follow how thin your blood is.  you will alsoneed follow up with a kidney doctor to follow your kidneyfunction, a hematologist to assess you for a predisposition toclotting and help manage this, and a rheumatologist as some ofyour tests suggest a possible autoimmune disorder.  we havescheduled these appointments for you.your medications have been changed.  you have been started oncoumadin, a blood thinner, that you will need to take until yourare told to stop by a doctor.  your blood has not yet beenthinned enough by coumadin so you are also being discharged onenoxaparin(lovenox), which will keep your blood thin until yourcoumadin levels are adequate.  when your coumadin levels areadequate for 24 hours you can stop the enoxaparin.  you havealso been started on morphine sustained release and immediaterelease for pain.  you should not drive while using thesemedications as they can make you sleepy.  you were also startedon gabapentin (neurontin) to help manage your pain.please seek immediate medical attention if you experience chestpain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any change fromyour baseline health statusfollowup instructions:md: [first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last
