lasix , 20 mg po qd .physical examination :the patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .she had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .she had no jugular venous distention or bruits .the lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .she had no definite s3 .the liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .her spleen could not be palpated .she had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .laboratory data :on admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , pt 12.7/10.1 , ptt 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , bun 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , sgot 37 , digoxin level 0.7 .hospital course :the patient was admitted to dr. shatermivaet s brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .accordingly , an oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .this revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .a lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .during this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with vitamin k therapy with pts normalizing .anca serum results were negative .ana results were also nonsuggestive .the patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a vascular radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .there was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .a head ct was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .she also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .the conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .dr. trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .on 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .she underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .she was received in the respiratory intensive care unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .her rate was well controlled on digoxin .the patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .on the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as solu-medrol therapy .calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .she continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .she continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with coumadin .she was effectively anticoagulated with a pt in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .she also received a radiation therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .she did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .discharge diagnosis :metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .medications on discharge :coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 meq po bid ; augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; carafate , 1 gram po bid ; synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .disposition :the patient was discharged home with terchestlumnesamp medical center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and pt .the patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .she will be maintained on a pt between 15 and 17 with coumadin .arrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .the prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .lenni brain , m.d.dictating for :ertca trial , m.d.tr :ak / bmotdd :05/15/93td :05/15/93cc :dr. trial , ertca dirk , dr. lenni brain
