provider:  newton, queenhistory:       routine screeningreport     bilateral mammogram     the present study is compared to previous films.     there are scattered fibroglandular densities.     there is architectural distortion and skin and trabecular     thickening involving the left breast that are consistent with post     treatment changes.  there is no evidence of new or recurrent     disease.     no suspicious mass, calcifications or architectural distortion are     identified in the right breast.  a clip and calcifications are     noted in the upper outer quadrant from prior benign percutaneous     biopsy.     there is no mammographic evidence of malignancy in the right     breast.     impression     post treatment changes involving the left breast with no evidence     of new or

to be higest. eventually will need to be on maximal doses of metformin (2550 mg qd). hypoglycemic event management reviewed.still with frequent dietary indiscretions, such as eating candy and pizza on regular basis.2) diet modification reviewed.3) htn/proteinuria: not optimally controlled. will add atenolol for now. rationale for this reviewed with pt. cont. acei and adjust next time based on microalbumin. previously referred to renal for eval.4) osteoporosis: stable. cont. fosamax. reviewd proper use-drinking of water and staying upright for at least 30 minutes after taking pill.5)
