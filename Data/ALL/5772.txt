date :10/06/2003discharge diagnoses :1. acute chronic renal insufficiency due to multiple myeloma2. multiple myeloma ( progressive )3. type ii diabetes mellitus4. hypercalcemia5. chronic metabolic acidosis ( incompletely compensated )6. chronic leg pain and weakness of uncertain etiology7. chronic obstructive lung disease ( former smoker )8. chronic anemia ( multifactorial )9. hyperlipidemia10. history of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )principal procedure :nonehospital course and treatment :this is one of several ponta,itri- university medical center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench jones proteinuria over one year ago .there were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with prednisone .she had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .the patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .the weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .her appetite was gone .she was having some nausea .no recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .no changes in her breathing .she did not seem sleepy or confused .physical examination :blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .temperature 97 .the patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .she could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .she has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .her lungs were clear .heart ; without murmur or gallop .her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .she had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .she was moving all four extremities .her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .laboratory data on admission :hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , bun and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .hospital course and treatment :the patient was admitted to the ponta,itri- university medical center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium k-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .over the following days , she was gently hydrated .her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .she was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .in the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .she tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .the patient , her son randdor so and i had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .the family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .they did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse decadron therapy with consists of oral decadron forty mgs po q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of decadron on .by the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of nph .on the days when she was not on decadron the standing doses of nph were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .there had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .she was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that i discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .the problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .the patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son so .the patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .she will finish her last planned pulse of decadron by about november 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .medications on discharge :1. heparin 5000 units subq b.i.d.2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs po q.h.s.3. risperidone 3 mgs po q.h.s.4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subq , 251 to 300 give six units subq , from 301 to 350 give eight units subq , from 351 to 400 give ten units subq , and if over 400 give twelve units subq.she also has standing doses of insulin nph ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without decadron .5. metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs po b.i.d.6. calcium acetate ( phos-lo ) 667 mgs po t.i.d.7. trazodone 25 mics po q.h.s.8. neurontin 100 mics po q.h.s.9. dilaudid 1-2 mgs po q6h prn for leg pain .10. colace 100 mgs po t.i.d.11. senna two tablets po b.i.d.12. dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs po b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .the next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on wednesday , oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by november 25 , 2003 .13. ranitidine 75 mgs po b.i.d.14. sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs po t.i.d.15. hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.16. furosemide 40 mgs po b.i.d.the patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters po q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .the patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .the patient should have an arranged visit to see dr. lyn ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately friday , oct 15 ,
