male from cedar hill lakes, nevada w/ history of insulin-requiring dm previously followed at cottage sanatorium, admitted to linden health care center after becoming unresponsive during a visit to his sister in maryland. by report, patient was sitting on the couch at his sister's house, slumped to the floor and had seizure activity x 45seconds that was witnessed by ems sevices. accu-checks done at that time were >500 and attempts at intubation were unsuccessful. he was transported to er, where additional attempts to secure his airway were also unsuccessful, by 2 physicians. there appeared to be some sot of stricture in the upper airway (not obvious on ct scan). however, pt had witnessed emesis, and was placed on 100% nonrebreather mask, with versed and propofol for sedation with adequate o2 saturation. a x-ray confirmed dependent lung infiltrates consistent with aspiration pneumonia, and pt was started on clindamycin.on arrival to the er, patient was also found to have a blood pressure of 248/146. he received 50mg dose of labetolol in the er as well as several additional doses in the icu. in the icu, patient did not have any further witnessed seizure activity. a head ct demonstrated no focal lesion, ic hemorrhage or other abnormality. pt was treated with dilantin and iv insulin infusion. serum ketones were negative. additional workup revealed lvh by ekg criteria, as well as renal insufficiency cr 2.6. urine tox was positive for benzos, but was otherwise negative.patient also developed leukoytosis (wbc ?) with temp of 102 degrees. although he had minimal neck stiffness by neurology consult exam, he underwent a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a colorless clear fluid, with glucose of 108, tp 44. grams stain was negative. tube #4 contained 21rbcs and 7 wbcs with a diff of 96% pmns and 4% lymphs. csf cultures and blood cultures were also done, and are pending.during his hospital course, patient maintained adequate oxygenation with nasal trumpet in place. abg on

cardiac enzymes were negative. after patient's mother arrived from georgia, she requested transfer to bmh.had no reported history of hypertension or seizure disorders. mother reports patient having occasional spells in the past, lasting 5-10minutes where patient would become non communicative, associated with elevated glucose.pmh:1.	insulin dependent dm, diagnosed age 12. was followed at cottage
