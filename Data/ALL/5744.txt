diagnosis: recurrent pleural effusions and shortness ofbreath from yellow nail syndrome.secondary diagnoses: 1. hypertension.2. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.3. anxiety.4. diabetes mellitus.5. chronic renal insufficiency.chief complaint: dyspnea on exertion.history of present illness: ms. cabaniss is a 70-year-old woman witha history of yellow nail syndrome ,hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes ,who has had multiple admissions since october 2001. the first wasan admission to an outside hospital from 5/25/01 - 11/20/01.at that time , she had increased shortness of breath , and wasdiagnosed with bilateral pleural effusions and a pericardialeffusion. she had a pericardial window and 600 cc were drainedfrom her pericardium , as well as pleural effusions drained. shewas discharged at that time with a diagnosis of congestive heartfailure , secondary to cor pulmonale. the second admission wasfrom 8/28/01 - 8/10/01 at the aen medical center . at that time , she hadincreased lower extremity edema. she was diuresed during thatadmission , and again her pleural effusions were tapped. anechocardiogram at that time revealed mild lvh , an ejection fractionof 55-60% , no wall motion abnormalities and a moderate-largepericardial effusion with fibrinous strands.a catheterization of her left and right heart revealed a rightatrial pressure of 5 , an rv pressure of 45/11 , pa pressures of38/18 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 22 , lv pressurewas 127/14. there was no constrictive pericardial disease orrestrictive cardiomyopathy. she also had no malignant cells in herpleural effusion , which was exudated. anca , ana , spep werenegative. she also had a renal ultrasound that was without mass orhydronephrosis , 24 hour urine collection with decreased protein.the third admission was at beysa dward hospital from 11/15/01 - 1/16/01 , forincreasing shortness of breath and increasing lower extremityedema. at that time she was diuresed , found to be iron deficient.she had bilateral thoracentesis , which revealed exudativeeffusions. pfts revealed a fev1 of .9 , 40% of predicted , an fvc of1.26 , 43% of predicted , an fev1/fvc ratio of 93% , a tlc of 2.07 ,40% of predicted , and a dlco of 8.42 , also 40% of predicted. shewas ruled out for tb with serial asbs during this admission.she was also diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome at that time ,consisting of the clinical syndrome of recurrent pleural effusions ,lymphedema and yellow fingernails. she was started on high dosevitamin e , and evaluated by ct surgery for a possible pleurodesis.however , she was sent home at that time with an increased dose ofdiuretics.since her discharge in july , she has been aggressively diuresed ,but the diuretics were stopped secondary to hyperkalemia. in september2001 , she was found to have a 10 pound weight gain and wasrestarted on lasix. over the week prior to admission , she has hadincreasing dyspnea on exertion. she has baseline shortness ofbreath and orthopnea , but her orthopnea has also worsened. herweight at discharge in july was 208 , and on admission shecurrently weighs 238 , and was 231 pounds a month prior toadmission. she denies wheezing , but does have a chronic cough withwhite sputum. she has had some substernal chest pain that is sharpwith dyspnea on exertion , which lasts for awhile without radiation.she also has increasing lower extremity edema. in the emergencydepartment , she was found to be afebrile , heart rate 103 ,respiratory rate 24 , blood pressure 95/41 and satting 91% on 2liters. she was given albuterol and atrovent nebs withoutimprovement and lasix 160 mg iv with a 600 cc diuresis.past medical history: 1. hypertension. 2. chronic anemia.3. lymphedema ,

syndrome. she was admitted withincreasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and a weight gain overthe past week prior to admission. she has most likely had afailure of home diuretics , and needed to have her effusions tappedalong with some definitive therapy for her yellow nail syndrome interms of recurrent pleural effusions.hospital course: 1. pulmonary. we initially diuresed ms. jowellwith iv lasix , along with diuril. she had briskdiuresis overnight , but was still short of breath the next day. onhospital day #2 , we did a thoracentesis on her right side and wereable to remove 1.5 liters of clear , yellowish fluid. the fluid wassent for cytology , as well as chemistries and returned as anexudative effusion with predominant lymphocytes. the cytology wasnegative for any malignant cells. the pulmonary team wasconsulted , who decided that she would benefit from a pleurodesis toprevent effusions from recurring. we consulted thoracic surgery ,who requested a ct scan after a thoracentesis to assess her lungsfor evidence of malignancy.ct scan was done on 9/19/01 , but due to atelectasis and having todo the study without iv contrast , there were areas in her right andleft lungs that appeared nodular or opacified and could have beenmalignancies. ct surgery also requested cardiac clearance beforeany definitive surgical therapy was done due to new onset svt. we obtained astress mibi. on 9/4/01 , she was taken to the operating room for surgeryof the right chest. at that time , dr. women , the cardiothoracicsurgeon took biopsies of her pleura , which were reportedlythickened and yellow. she also took a wedge biopsy of the rightlower lobe. those biopsies have returned , and revealed mildnonspecific interstitial pneumonitis with chronic bronchiolitis.the diaphragm was also biopsied , and was determined to be lymphoidtissue in a fibrous tissue fragment. she had a chest tube placedat the time of operation and tolerated that well. however , after thatprocedure , she was deemed unstable by the pacu team and wasadmitted to micu overnight. she extubated without problems andremained on a few liters of oxygen overnight , with oxygensaturations in the 90%. she was readmitted to the medicine teamon the following day , 8/28/01. overall , she tolerated thatprocedure well. her chest tube that was placed on the right sidedid not drain much fluid over the next few days. however , thepleural effusion on the left side , did increase in size and we dida thoracentesis on 8/28/01. we removed 1 liter of turbid ,yellowish brown fluid. the chemistries revealed a lymphocyte andmacrophage predominance and the cytology is still pending at thistime. as her chest tube was not draining much fluid , the thoracicsurgery team decided to pleurodese her with doxycycline , which hasshown to be effective in yellow nail syndrome in patient's 70% ofthe time. the pleurodesis was on 3/29/01. she tolerated thisprocedure well , and had little chest tube drainage over the next 48hours. the chest tube was pulled on 6/2/01.mrs. musson 's shortness of breath was much improved after theinitial thoracentesis on the right , and she is currently on herhome oxygen requirement of 2 liters , satting in the mid-90%. theplan is for her to see dr. colasante in 2 weeks and also have afollow-up chest x-ray. at that time , dr. ostermann will determine ifthere is fluid reaccumulating on the right after the pleurodesis.she can then have a repeat pleurodesis on the right , or an initialpleurodesis on the left.2. cardiovascular. mrs. blan was tachycardic on admission , andcontinued to be tachycardic throughout the admission. she wasinitially diuresed with iv lasix and diuril , and was probably overdiuresed , a total of 2-3 liters over a number of hours overnight.on hospital day #2 , she was found to be tachycardic with rates inthe 140s-150s and atrial fibrillation. she converted back tonormal sinus rhythm with 3 doses of iv calcium channel blockers anda diltiazem drip. she was then maintained on diltiazem sr 60 mg pob.i.d. throughout the admission and remained in normal sinusrhythm. however , her tachycardia was noted to be multifocal hltachycardia during her micu admission. at the time of admission ,we did a pulsus which was only 8 mmhg. she had a bedsideechocardiogram to rule out a pericardial effusion , which revealed atrace pericardial effusion. she also had a dobutamine mibi forcardiac clearance for the cardiothoracic surgical procedure. herheart rate increased from 107-129 , and the blood pressure decreasedfrom 115/70 - 110/70 at peak stress. the clinical response todobutamine was non-ischemic , the blood pressure response wasnormal , and the ekg response to dobutamine was non-ischemic. therewere no definite regional perfusion defects seen on the stress orrest images. however , only planer images could be obtained , due todifficulty with positioning of the patient's left arm. her resultswere determined to be normal , and suggestive of no evidence ofhemodynamically secondary cad , although the study was technicallylimited.in terms of her diuresis , ms. duensing was kept on iv lasix for onlythe first few days of her admission , and then was switched to podiuretics. initially at a dose of 200 mg po b.i.d. , and thendecreased to 120 mg po b.i.d. her lower extremity edema decreasedsignificantly , along with her pleural effusions.3. renal. ms. handy 's baseline creatinine is 1.7 , her creatininethroughout her admission varied between 1.6-1.9. we caused a mildcontraction alkalosis with diuretics , but were able to replete herelectrolytes as needed. she will follow with dr. svinth for herrenal insufficiency as an outpatient.4. endocrine. ms. reppell has type ii diabetes and was on glyburide5 mg q. d. as an outpatient. she continued that therapy as aninpatient , and her finger sticks were in good control during thisadmission.5. rheumatology. ms. chad has a history of gout , and we wereconcerned about precipitating a gout attack with the aggressivediuresis. we continued her colchicine and decreased herallopurinol to 200 mg po q. d. we also continued her vitamin etherapy for the yellow nail syndrome.6. hematology. she has chronic anemia , and we continued her ironand procrit treatment during the admission.disposition: ms. souza will be discharged to home with vnaservices to administer her twice weekly procrit doses , and physicaltherapy to aid her in regain her strength and range of motion inher joints infected with gout. she has been instructed to makefollow-up appointments with dr. amicone in a few weeks , and to havea chest x-ray on the day that she sees dr. burchell she should alsofollow-up with dr. donkin in the renal clinic.discharge medications: 1. allopurinol 200 mg po
