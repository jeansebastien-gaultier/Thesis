6/1/2001principal diagnosis: inferior myocardial infarction.secondary diagnoses: 1. hypertension.2. left frontal lobe meningioma.3. diastolic dysfunction.history of present illness: ms. testani is a 90+ year-old woman witha history of hypertension , prioratrial fibrillation , who presented to the ie health on8/9/01 with shortness of breath and some chest pain lastingseveral hours at home. she was brought in by her greatgranddaughter and found to have st segment elevations inferiorly onan electrocardiogram concerning for inferior myocardial infarction.at that point she was transferred to hobert centerfor emergent catheterization. in the emergency room she wastreated with lasix , lopressor , morphine , nitropaste , aspirin andheparin and then sent for cardiac catheterization. cardiaccatheterization showed a right dominant system with no left maindisease , mid left anterior descending coronary artery 80 percentlesion , a proximal left circumflex left anterior descendingcoronary artery lesion and a proximal 100 percent posteriordescending coronary artery stenosis. the posterior descendingcoronary artery was intervened upon and stented to a residualstenosis of 0 percent. the patient tolerated the procedure wellwithout any complications and was then transferred to the intensivecare unit for further monitoring. on admission to the coronarycare unit the patient had no complaints , including no shortness ofbreath , and no chest pain. she was noted to have a right groinhematoma for which pressure was held.past medical history: hypertension , atrial fibrillation , historyof pulmonary edema , left frontal lobemeningioma as documented by mri of the brain in february of 2000.medications on admission: lasix dose unknown , atenolol 50 mg p.o.q day , zestril 10 mg per day , isordil 10mg t.i.d. and meclizine p.r.n.allergies: no known drug allergies.physical exam: temperature 98 , heart rate 75 , blood pressure140/70 , respiratory rate 16 , 94 percent on 2 litersof oxygen. general: awake , alert and oriented in no acutedistress. oropharynx is clear. crackles present bilaterallythroughout both lung fields. cardiac: regular , rate and rhythm.normal s1 and s2. ii/vi systolic murmur at the left lower sternalborder. no radiation to the neck. abdomen: soft , nontender andnondistended. positive bowel sounds. extremities: no edema. 2plus dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. neurological: neurologicstatus intact. nonfocal exam.laboratory data on admission: white blood cell count 13.6 ,hematocrit 39 , platelets 222 , 000.sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 100 , bicarbonate 26 , bun 37 ,creatinine 2.0 , glucose 192. pt was 11 , ptt 23 , inr 0.88. cknumber one is 216 with no mb fraction done prior to transfer. cknumber two post cardiac catheterization 2577 , mb 310 , troponin3.49.electrocardiogram prior to transfer showed normal sinus rhythm atthe time pre-catheterization. rate of 75. two millimeter stsegment elevation in leads ii , iii and f.hospital course: 1. cardiovascular: the patient was transferredto the coronary care unit after cardiaccatheterization and right coronary artery stent for furthermanagement. she ruled in for a myocardial infarction. her peak ckwas 2577 with a mb fraction of 310. troponin on admission was3.49. she was placed on aspirin , plavix , lopressor , zestril andsimvastatin. two days after this initial catheterization on2/0/01 , the patient was transferred to the floor and subsequentlyhad an episode of flash pulmonary edema and was thought to be todiastolic dysfunction. this occurred in the context of her havinga systolic blood pressure of 200. she was then transferred back tothe coronary care unit where she had intermittent complaints ofchest pain. electrocardiogram showed pseudo normalization of the twaves laterally. her cks continued to trend down however due tothe concern of further ischemia she was placed on heparin andbrought back to the catheterization laboratory on 10/10/01 forstenting of the left circumflex lesion. since the second stent shecontinued to do well from a cardiovascular standpoint. her ckscontinued to trend down. an echocardiogram was done which showedan ejection fraction of 45 percent , inferior posterior akinesis ,moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.she was managed with aspirin , plavix with plans to keep her on thisfor one month , zocor and lopressor. due to a rising creatinineafter the second catheterization her zestril has been stopped andshe has been started on hydralazine until her creatininenormalizes.2. renal: the patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.6 whichincreased to 4.0 after her second catheterization. the etiology isdeemed to be contrast induced nephropathy. her creatinine is nowimproving down to 3.2 at the time of discharge. this should befollowed and her zestril restarted at 10 mg per day and thehydralazine stopped when the creatinine normalizes to below 2.0.electrolytes were stable throughout the admission.3. pulmonary: no active issues currently. she did have anepisode of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high bloodpressure found to be due to diastolic dysfunction. the goal is tocontrol the patient's blood pressure to avoid these episodes.there is no need for diuresis.4. gastrointestinal: the patient was admitted with a hematocritof 39 but did drop to 27 slowly during the course of the admission.she did have guaiac positive stools while on heparin. she wastransfused a total of two units to keep her hematocrit above 30 andfor the five days prior to discharge , her hematocrit was stable at34. the patient consumes a low fat low cholesterol diet and is onprilosec 20 mg q day.5. psychiatry/neurologic: the patient was noted to sun down atnight with episodes of confusion and agitation. a psychiatryconsult was obtained and felt that the patient's behavior wasconsistent with dementia and recommended starting zyprexa. thepatient was placed on standing zyprexa 5 mg at night and continuedto improve on this medication. she had no episodes of agitationafter being transferred to the floor. in addition she has ahistory of left frontal lobe mass which is consistent with ameningioma. this has been noted on ct and mri scans done in februaryof 2000. neurosurgery consult was obtained and felt that surgerywould not be a good option for this patient , in addition they didnot feel that the mass was responsible for any mental statuschanges.6. infectious disease: the patient has a history of a positiverpr which has not been treated previously. she is now beingtreated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin 2.4 million unitstimes three injections. she has one injection pending which is dueon 0/7/01. in addition she has had a negative lumbar puncturefor neurologic syphilis.disposition on discharge: the patient is to be discharged to thechora medical center witheventual plans to return to home.she will also follow up with a new primary care provider , dr. ernesto fouch at the crestsant health on 5/15/01.medications on discharge: tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n.pain , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day , colace100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , robitussin 15 cc p.o. q 4 hours p.r.n. cough ,hydralazine 20 mg p.o. q.i.d. plan to stop hydralazine whencreatinine returns below 2.0 and at that time zestril 10 mg per dayshould be started. lopressor 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerinp.r.n. , prilosec 20 mg p.o. q day , penicillin benzathine 2.4million units im q weeks , last dose on 0/7/01. percocet 1-2tablets p.o. q 8 hours p.r.n. osteoarthritic pain , zocor 20 mg p.o.q hs , imdur 30 mg p.o. q day , zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q h.s. , plavix 75mg p.o. q day times 24 days.dictated by: jasper buttel , m.d. ny61attending: filiberto wilton
