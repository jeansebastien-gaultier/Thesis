history of fsh producingmacroadenoma s/p tss x 2 complicated by panhypopituitarism forwhich she is on chronic prednisone and levothyroxine admittedwith hypotension, hypoglycemia, hypothermia and bradycardialikely due to adrenal crisis.1. adrenal crisis: unsure of the precipitant. could be medicalnoncompliance with past history even though patient and hersister report compliance.  it could also be precipitated byviral upper respiratory tract infection.  she was started on ivhydrocortisone in the micu and transitioned to prednisone 20 mgpo qdaily on discharge with help of endocrinology.she was empirically started on vancomcyin/zosyn to cover forbacterial infection precipitating adrenal crisis but they werediscontinued on day 3 as blood cultures were negative x 48 hoursand no source of infection noted on imaging and exam.  tte, ekgand cardiac enzymes did not reveal any cardiac pathology.2. hypernatremia: likely due to central diabetes insipidus.sodium returned to [location 213] with ddavp admission and urine outputreturend to  less than 200 cc/hr.  she was discharged onscheduled 0.1 mg of ddavp at bedtime.  she was also instructedto drink to thirst.3. panhypoptituitarism s/p tss x 2 for pituitary macroadenoma.continued on home levothyroxine 75 mcg po qdaily.glucocorticoid replacement as above.  currently not on anyestrogen replacement which she could benefit from to preventosteoporosis.4. prolong qtc: likely due to sinus bradycardia in setting ofelectrolyte imbalance. she does not report chest pain.5. fsh pituitary adenoma.  follow up with
