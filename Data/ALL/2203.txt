(unclear baseline requirement but on home oxygen). alsotachycardic to 100, tachypneic to mid 20's and hypertensive to160's. she had low grade fevers to 99. she was felt to be incongestive heart failure, was noted to have hyperkalemia, andapparently new renal failure with creatinine in 6's. a centralline was placed but then the patient became agitated,self-extracted the femoral line. serial haldol, benadryl andativan x3 were not effective in sedating her and therefore thepatient was intubated for airway protection. the femoral linewas replaced. the patient had a ng tube placed, was givenkayxelate, calcium gluconate, bicarb, insulin, and glucose forhyperkalemia, las well as lasix for chf. she was given a dose oflevoquin for uti/possible pneumonia. the patient had an aniongap

hospital course:discharge summary (as of [2167-5-27])assessment and plan:this is a 53 year old woman with coronary artery disease,congestive heart failure, copd, pulmonary hypertension, s/p laka who is oxygen dependent on nasal canula 4 liters at home,and polysubstance abuse who presented to [hospital3 35813] centerin [state 792]with altered mental status, hypoxia, andagitation.  she was intubated for airway protection andtransferred to [hospital1 18].  course complicated by anuric renalfailure requiring dialysis..1)mental status change:most likely multifactorial, as patient with previouspolysubstance abuse.  chronic small vessel disease noted on headct.  eeg negative for seizure activity.  per family, patientlives alone and able to care for herself and perform activitiesof daily living.on admission, toxicology screen revealed opiates and tricyclics,and by medical notes on transfer, patient had been using moresedating medications than normal.  neurology evaluated patientand vitamin b12 and folate levels were normal.  she receivedthiamine.  tsh level was elevated to 8 and her t4 was only veryslightly below normal.  thus, thyroid function was notattributed to altered mental status.  an eeg revealedencephalopathy, but no seizures.  ct head revealed chronic smallvessel disease.  lp and mri were deferred.-upon extubation, patient slowly became more alert, first withpurposeful eye tracking and then by following simple commands.she received haldol and ativan, which sedated her profoundly forseveral days. then, after extubation, she began to haveconversations but with frequent outbursts with cursing at times,poor attention and short term memory.  she became febrile on[2167-5-7], which was concerning for a line infection, and wastreated initially with vanco/zosyn changed to vanco/meropenemplan for 3 day course complete [2167-5-9]. c. diff negative x3.  herhead ct was unchanged.on [5-13], patient had her picc line and tunneled hd line placedand developed fevers within 12 hours.  only one blood culturefrom [5-14] revealed one bottle of staph coagulase negativeorganisms.  treated with ten day course of vancomycin (per hdprotocol) through [5-23].-lexapro was restarted on [2167-5-12], but held on [5-22].psychiatry continued to follow patient and for continuedoutbursts  recommended haldol 0.5mg po/iv three times daily.  asabove, concern that heavy sedatives with ativan and haldol causeprofound sedation.  she required soft wrist restraints forprevention of line removal. pt was transferred to the micu on[6-2] for respiratory compromise (see below).-upon arriving at the floor on [6-5] the patient was aox3, butwith residual confusion, impulse control issues, and aggitation. her course was complicated by recurrent episodes of aggitationand anxiety which were hard to control.  she perseverated on hermedications, her course, and her dietary restrictions.  psychwas consulted and attempted to help control these outburstswithout using benzodiazepems.  she often complained of dyspnea,but requested ativan as treatment. she was transferred to themicu for low o2 saturation, where she was diuresed forcongestive heart failure/volume overload. she was transferredback to the floor on [6-15], where she continued to be anxious andtake off her o2 mask. psych recommended continuing standinghaldol as well as 100mg neurontin qhs. benzodiazepines wereavoided. this combination had a calming effect and the patientwas significantly less agitated without being over-sedated,thought to be back to her baseline mental status.  remained atbaseline mental status for the rest of the hospitalization.2) respiratory compromise:at outside hospital, patient was hypoxic to high 80's on 3l.  athome, she requires 4l nasal canula.  patient has history ofcopd, chf, and pulmonary hypertension per outside notes.intubated on transfer and thought that congestive heart failurecontributed to hypoxemic event.  no clear pneumonia.  patientwas aggressively diuresed via hemodialysis.  she was extubatedon [5-7].  hypoxia seems out of proportion to edemademonstrated on imaging.  tte was negative for patent foramenovale..on [2167-6-1], the patient triggered for hypoxia 68% on 6 liters(the patient formerly had been 90-92% on 6 liters. on recheck,the o2 sat was 88% and then 90-91% on 6 liters withoutintervention. the patient was scheduled to have hd as scheduledon [2167-6-2]..at hd, the hd catheter was noted to be nonfunctioning. tpa wastried without success. then, the patient was found to be hypoxicto 75% at hd with abg 7.53/26/44 0on a 40% venti mask.  on anrb, the patient's saturations improved to 97% and a repeat gaswas 7/53/27/58..the patient denied any chest pain and says the shortness ofbreath was not acute in onset but had been developing over thepast few days. however, her sbp was noted to be 188-216 duringhd and the patient was given her am bp meds as a result.  cxrindicated volume overload and pt. was thought to have had acutepulmonary edema [1-9] hypertension and inability to dialyze.  ptwas transferred to micu and had temporary femoral hd lineinitially placed, then tunneled hd line placed by ir [6-3].  shehad 7l removed during micu course with improvement ofoxygenation and was sent back to floor [6-5]..while on the floor she was maintained on 6l of nc.  she didoccasionally complain of dyspnea and anxiety, however it washard to differentiate this from her psychiatric issues, as shewas often breathing at a normal rate and sat'ing in the mid 90swhile complaining.  she generally maintained saturations from88-95%.  she did have at least two desat's into the low 80s atnight, but responded within minutes to reassurance and haldolwithout changing any pulmonary medications or oxygen.  on [6-9]she had an episode of somlenence and increased confusion afterher haldol had been increased to 2mg/dose and her nc o2 droppedto 4l.  she was somlenent but arousable, and still oriented toself  she recovered mental status quickly after a 50% venti maskwas placed, and was then seen by the micu staff. she wastransferred again to the micu at that point, and again wasdiuresed aggressively with good result. repeat tte again showedno patent foramen ovale/shunt. cta was negative for pe..she was transferred back to the floor on [6-15], where shecontinued to required 6-8 l o2 and occasionally desat'd insetting of anxiety. an echo [6-19] showed evidence of worseningchf (ef 30% now, was >55% in [month (only) ]), which would explaincontinued increased oxygen requirement and sob, with evidence ofpulmonary edema on cxr. in conjunction with the renal team, thepatient required almost daily hd or ultrafiltration to draw offfluid. attempts were made with medications to balance the needfor afterload reduction with supporting a blood pressure whichcould tolerate volume loss through dialysis. this primarilyinvolved decreasing the patient's betablocker and verapamil dosesignificantly, while maintaining isosorbide nitrate. the patientwas witnessed several times eating high salty foods, and beingnon-compliant with the fluid restriction which complicatedattempts to manage her volume status. with aggressive hd, aswell as improved management of her anxiety and aggitation(above) the patient gradually was weaned down to her baselinerequirement of 4l o2 on nasal cannula..3) anuric renal failure:  atn likely from tca/opiate overdose.outside hospital records revealed creatinine of 4.0 in [month (only) 958][2166].  on admission, anuric.  she was hyperkalemic, so initiallyreceived kayxelate, calcium gluconate, insulin, andbicarbonated.  no ecg changes.  renal ultrasound negative forobstruction.  received aggressive hemodialysis sessions. therewas concern that tunneled dialysis line infected, but as she wasnot rigoring and did not ever develop fever or hypotensionexcept when on dialysis, believed that filter on hemodialysismachine may have caused adverse reaction.  asaghi filter used on[5-22] with good effect..management of the patient's volume status was complicated bydietary noncompliance and aggitation. after requiring 2 micutransfers from the floor due to decreased oxygen saturation frompulmonary edema, we were finally able to dialyze hersufficiently to bring her back to baseline oxygen requirement.we monitored her intake carefully and impressed upon her theimportance of dietary compliance. adding neurontin to heranxiety regimen helped calm her and she became more compliantwith our management strategy and was less likely to take off heroxygen support.  renal recommends performing a 24 hour urinecollection after one month to re-evaluate her renal status..4) cardiovascular:--ischemia: history of coronary artery disease.  as outpatient,on aspirin but no beta blocker or ace-inhibitor.  ecg withoutischemic changes and initial cardiac enzymes negative. continuedaspirin and added beta blocker.--pump: evidence of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failureon admission.  as anuric, removed excess fluid withhemodialysis.--rhythm: remained in sinus rhythm.  started on beta blockade.--hypertension:  severely elevated blood pressures.  startedamlodipine, metoprolol, and isorbide.  goal blood pressure <170,but due to longstanding hypertension, developed worsened mentalstatus when blood pressures less than 140.  most likely due tohypoperfusion.  in setting of hypotensive episodes duringdialysis, held antihypertensives on mornings of dialysis. overthe course of hospitalization, we adjusted her bp medicationsaccording to what was tolerated during dialysis. on discharge,she is taking isosorbide mononitrate 30mg sr and toprol xl 100mgq day..5) gi:on admission, apparent ugi bleeding.  coffee grounds in ngt butthis was in setting of supratherapeutic inr. subsequentlyresolved status post reversal of inr.  treated with iv (and thenpo) protonix.  her serial hematocrits remained stable.abdominal ct on [5-1] unremarkable. diverticulosis was noted onsubsequent abdominal ct (as above)..6) infectious disease:on admission, received levofloxacin, but then broadened to zosynand vancomycin for uti.  completed seven day course on [5-5].shortly after discontinuation of antibiotics, was transientlyfebrile, so started meropenem and vancomycin on [5-7] for 3 daycourse.picc line was placed and tunneled hd line placed on [5-13].febrile shortly after line placed (1/4 bottles with staphcoagulase negative), so started ten day course of vancomycinthat was completed on [5-23]. new picc placed [6-3] forantibiotics and question of infection.on [6-17] id was consulted for rising leukocytosis. bacillusspecies grew from [6-19] picc blood cx, pt was started on cefepimefor bacteremia on [6-20] (initial culture result said gnr) andpicc was d/c'd. was discovered on [6-23] that bacillus likely wasa contaminant. pt has been afebrile, but given persistently highwbc, there was concern for infection or other etiology. [6-18]culture from hd catheter had no growtn. c. diff was negative.antibiotics were discontinued on [6-23] given no organism isolatedand patient being afebrile. subsequent culture from [6-24] showedno growth to date. can consider other cause of leukocytosis:patient was not on systemic steroids so that is unlikely to be acause. patient had mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung nodules,which could suggest a malignant cause. recommend working upmalignancy as outpatient given that patient is clinically stableand would benefit from rehab placement..7) depression:on outpatient lexapro.  restarted during hospitalization, butdiscontinued, per psychiatry, on [5-22]..8) prophylaxis:patient on sc heparin (was on coumadin as outpatient, butunclear reason), lansoprazole, bowel regimen, and thiamine..9) access:picc placed on [5-13], but removed [5-22].  tunneledhemodialysis catheter placed on [5-13].  picc placed [6-3],removed [6-21]..10) fen:initially on tubefeeds.  speech and swallow evaluation on [5-18] cleared patient for thin liquids and pureed solids.aspiration precautions. eventually advanced to regular renaldiet. occasionally was hyponatremic, thought due to excess freewater ingestion.  was kept on fluid restriction 1l/day, withvarying effect as patient would sometimes obtain water/fluidswhen the nurse was not looking..11) rash:patient noted to have morbilliform rash on trunk and flank onevening of [5-25].  most likely result of drug reaction.potentially vancomycin.  started on hydrocortisone cream, sarnalotion, and triamcinolone cream. resolved. pt also noted to haveintragluteal irritation with sattelite lesions, likely yeastinfection. started on miconazole powder..12) code:full.  confirmed with daughter.
