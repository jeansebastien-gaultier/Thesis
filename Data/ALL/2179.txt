basilar artery caliber.4. hypoplastic right v4 segment.---assessment and plan: this is an 81 year old female with multiplemedical problems who presents with multiple vague complaints. she likelyhas more than one medical issue going on simultaneously.--cv:ischemia: pt has known cad. worsening angina with exertion. no s/sof acs currently. ekg shows no st segment elevations. checked set ofcardiac enzymes which were negative. she was continued on asa , statin , bb-pump: the pt has history of diastolic heart failure. echo over one yearago showed ef 55-60%. it also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation. hersymptoms of doe , fatigue , le swelling , abd girth could also be explainedby cor pulmonale or worsening heart failure. a cxr was performedwhich showed stable cardiomegaly and no signs of overt edema butclinically with her elevated jvp , increased abd girth and le edemawere suggestive of fluid overload. bnp was low at 122 but likely she wassomewhat overloaded. an echo was performed which showed elevatedpulm artery pressure of 45 , moderate tricuspid regurgitation , mild tomoderately enlarged r ventricle and moderately enlarged right atrium. efof 60%. these findings are suggestive of potential cor pulmonale. plan isto diurese pt as outpt and repeat echo by pcp as outpt , thenconsideration of cardiology referral. lisinopril is added as allergy( hyperkalemia ) , perhaps can be given as small dose with close monitoring.defer to pcp. the pt was placed on strict i/os , daily weights. avoidedfluid restriction given low bp for now.-rhythm: the pt has fatigue , dizziness , nausea raising the concern fordig toxicity. she also has known afib. a digoxin level was checked andcame back at 1.4 which might be slightly high for her renal function ,age and muscle mass. her digoxin dose was therefore decreased to 0.125mgdaily. she was monitored on telemetry which showed frequent ventricularpacing and occasional pvcs.---ortho: the pt had ct of cervical spine in march '07 for neck painradiating to the l , as is her current presentation. the ct showed djdbut no fracture or other concerning finding. no recent trauma. her painis likely from worsening djd. plan conservative intervention withhotpacks , tylenol. no further imaging indicated. home pt planned.---neuro: the pt has hx of cva but current cta shows no evidence ofacute cva. her neuro exam is fairly unremarkable despite multiplevague complaints of weakness , numbness , pain. she was continued onasa. neuro exam monitored without focal deficits. treated headache withtylenol. if the pt's overall pain persists , she might benefit from painconsult as outpt---pulm: pt has no known pulm disease but has been prescribed albuterolinhaler. if she in fact has pulm htn , she may have causative pulmetiology. cxr showed no acute pulm issues. if echo suggestive , pfts asoutpt per pcp.---gi: bowel regimen for constipation. ppi for gerd.---endo: pt has iddm. it is not exactly clear what she
