arterial supply with embolus is seen in this area;however in the setting of other emboli and configuration of thisfinding, it is concerning for infarct.  there is no pleural orpericardial effusion.  in the left hemithorax, there is a largehiatal hernia with stomach and ge junction above the diaphragm.this causes compressive atelectasis (4:102) on the adjacentlung. the patient is intubated with endotracheal tubeterminating approximately 4 cm from the carina.  an nasogastrictube is seen in the esophagus but does not reach the ge junctionor the stomach. subdiaphgramatically, gallstones are seen. theaorta and the great vessels appear unremarkable. no suspiciouslytic or sclerotic lesions are seen within the bones.impression:1.  right middle and upper lobe nodular opacities as well
