plan:87m h/o cad (3vd), pvd, dm, htn moderate b/l carotid stenosis, chronic ulcer in the distal ulcer w/ dissection, w/ a dilated cbd and choledocholithiasis for which we are consulted.we will plan for further evaluation of the patient&#8217;s biliary system with an ercp. given the location of the largest stone i.e. not impacted with very slight lft derangement i am concerned for alternative sources of the patient&#8217;s biliary dilation (e.g. pancreatic ca).i have spoke to the patient and his 2 sons that given his numerous comorbidities in particular his cardiac status and carotid disease that he is at higher risk for complications which they all appreciate.recommendations:-cont cipro/flagyl, if any concerns for decompsenation would add ampicillin also-ivf-clear liquids ok
