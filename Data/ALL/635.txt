years and no alcohol.family history: no family history of heart disease.physical exam: on presentation , t 97.3 , bp 143/70 , pulse 57 , 98%on 2 liters. this is an obese female in no apparent distress ,sitting up in bed. heent: extraocular movements intact. scleraeanicteric. neck: supple , jvp at 14 cm. chest: cracklesbilaterally , left greater than right , half way up both lungfields with mild decreased breath sounds at the bases.cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm. normal s1 and s2. nomurmur , rubs , or gallops. abdomen: soft , nontender , andnondistended with positive bowel sound and no hepatosplenomegaly.extremities with 3+ edema as well as areas of erythematous andshiny shallow ulcerations. neurologically , euthymic withoutfocal deficits.laboratory data: on admission , significant for sodium 147 ,potassium 3.4 , chloride 110 , co2 26 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.6 , andglucose 69. cbc was significant for white count of 6.7 ,hematocrit 39.4 , and platelets of 258. her ck was 432. hertroponin was less than assay. her bnp was greater than assay andd-dimer was 50 and 69.chest x-ray showed decreased lung volumes with moderate cardiacenlargement. ekg showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 59 ,axis of -36 and no acute changes.assessment: this is a 63-year-old woman with history ofcongestive heart failure who presented with likely congestiveheart failure exacerbation.hospital course by system:1. cardiovascular: ischemia: there was concern regarding acuteand subacute silent ischemia given new st-t wave changes inlateral leads on the ekg. the patient was continued on heraspirin as well as statin. she was ruled out for an mi withnegative troponins x 3. she was continued on a low-doseshort-acting beta-blocker ( lopressor ). she was also continued onan ace inhibitor with this switched to captopril as ashort-acting ace inhibitor , which was titrated up as toleratedfor a goal blood pressure of systolic of 120. an adenosine mibiwas performed which was negative for perfusion defects. however ,echo showed global hypokinesis with depressed ejection fraction.cardiology consult was called and they recommended further workupwith cardiac catheterization. however , the patient refused thecatheterization.rhythm: the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.however , she remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout heradmission. she was monitored by cardiac telemetry with severalepisodes of 6 to 10 beats of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia. her electrolytes were carefully monitored andrepleted as necessary. she remained asymptomatic with the runsof nsvt and was continued on her beta-blocker. given her historyof atrial fibrillation as well as depressed ejection fraction ,she was restarted on coumadin.pump: the patient presented with a frank fluid overload withelevated jvp , lower extremity edema , and a bnp greater thanassay. she was aggressively diuresed with a goal of greater than-2 liters a day. she responded to 80 mg of iv lasix t.i.d. hercreatinine was carefully followed and did increase on 11/26/03 ,at which point diuresis was put on hold. the patient diuresedabout 3 to 4 liters each day during her hospital stay until7/7/03. at this point , she was thought to be very close toeuvolemic.given the patient's echo findings with depressed ejectionfraction and global hypokinesis , a workup for dilatedcardiomyopathy was begun. the patient did not wish for furtherinvestigation with cardiac catheterization or a cardiac mri. herother labs were unremarkable including a tsh , which was normal ,an ana which was negative , iron studies which did not show ironoverload , and thiamine which is pending at the time of thisdictation. the patient will require close followup with carefulfluid balance monitoring as well as followup with congestiveheart failure service.pulmonary: she initially presented with shortness of breath.however , this resolved with diuresis. she has a history of pe aswell as dvt and an elevated dimer was found on admission. therewas initial concern for pulmonary embolism , but the resolution ofsymptoms with diuresis and a history that was not suggestive ofpulmonary emboli , did not require further followup with spiralchest ct.heme: the patient's hematocrit was followed. the patient haschronic folate and iron-deficiency anemia and she was continuedon folate and iron replacement.endocrine: the patient was continued on nph 20 units for herknown diabetes. her blood sugars were in excellent control onthis regimen. avandia was held given it contraindication inheart failure.renal: the patient's creatinine was 1.6 on admission , which is upfrom about 0.8 in october of 2003. her urine eosinophils andsediment were unremarkable , but frank proteinuria was noted whichis consistent with her known nephrotic syndrome. her creatinineremained stable in the 1.5 to 1.6 range until 11/26/03 , when hercreatinine bumped to 2 and kept rising until 1/28/03 , when itreached 2.7. repeat urine electrolytes , urine eosinophils andsediment were sent at this point and they are pending at the timeof this dictation. the most likely explanation for increasingcreatinine was aggressive diuresis and intravascular volumedepletion. diuresis was put on hold on 11/2/03 and 10/10/03.given her increased creatinine , her ace inhibitor dose was halfedon 10/10/03. the plan is to continue to monitor her creatininefunction , follow up on her urine chemistries and if hercreatinine resolves , to resume gentle diuresis as necessary.infectious disease: the patient was found to have a uti with e.coli that was sensitive to bactrim and she was treated withbactrim with resolution.rheumatological: the patient with known chronic pain as well asarthritis. her celebrex was held given her increased creatinineand its propensity to cause fluid retention. her joint examrevealed swollen pip joints of both hands as well as markedswelling over both wrists. a rheumatoid factor was sent and thatcame back negative. for her pain , she was given oxycodone p.r.n.once her acute renal failure resolves , she may be transitionedto celebrex or other antiinflammatory medications which may bemore effected for her arthritis. ana came back negative.psyche: she was continued on celexa for depression.code status: full code.followup: the patient needs to follow up with the congestiveheart failure service as well as her primary care physician.discharge medications ( at the time of this dictation on1/28/03 ):1. aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.2. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. iron sulfate 325 mg
