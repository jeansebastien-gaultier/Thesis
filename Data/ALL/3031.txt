had family meeting [6-10]. discussed to stop vital signs,non-essential medications other than eye drops, pain meds, andpo antibiotics. patient was continued on maintainance iv fluids..# pain control - this was the family's primary goal of care.there were multiple etiologies of the pain including her chonicright shoulder pain, sacral decubiti with possible abcess,painful scalp leison, or the >15cm pelvic mass. pain control wastransitioned from outpatient oxycontin pills to fenanyl patchand oxycodone liquid. patient was comfortably sedated and onlyrequired additional pain medication when she was moved.palliative care was involved in pain management..# squamous cell ca, intracranial- the carcinoma developed overan unknown time period. it probably developed before her care tonursing home facility given that there was a rapid decline inher functional status and intracraninal involvement of thetumor.  she was evaluated as an outpatient by dermatology andwas determined to have a squamous cell ca as per biopsy on [5-25].initially, the family wanted to have a neurosurgicalintervention, but the patient's inr was 7.7 so she wastransferred to the micu for reversal. later, the family decidednot to have surgery once it became apparent that the morbity washigh. patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone formeningitis ppx and this was changed to po cefepoxidime after afamily meeting determining that she would not want ivantibiotics. wound care was done to address her head wound..# resolved hypovolemia/ acute renal failure/ hypernatremia -secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia in thesetting of diruetic use. cr 2.0 on admission, most recentbaseline at [hospital1 18] 1.1. this was the reason for the picc lineplacement and why the family wanted ivf..# pelvic mass - there is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass seenon renal ultrasound. this may be a source of pain..# afib not on anticoagulation - patient has a history of atrialfibrillation but was placed on anticoagulation for a recentphelbiltis. given that the scalp wound oozes blood, the familyhas decided that they do not want anticoagulation..# dm-hiss.comfort measures onlydischarge to deathmedications on admission:medications at home:lasix 40 mg po dailylisinopril 40 mg po dailyoxycontin 20 mg po q12, 10mg po qhsxalatan 0.005 % eye drops 1 drops(s) once daily, at bedtimeazopt 1 % eye drops ophthalmic 1 drop dailytylenol 1g po tidserax 10mg po bidmvi po dailypro-stat 64 -- unknown strength, twice dailyzinc chelated 50 mg po dailyvitamin c 500 mg sr po dailysimethicone 80 mg chewable tab po prn.medications on transfer:ceftriaxone 1 gm iv q24hvancomycin 1000 mg iv once (dose by level)oxycodone sr (oxycontin) 10 mg po q12hhumalog insulin sliding scalelatanoprost 0.005% ophth. soln. 1 drop both eyes hspantoprazole 40 mg po q24hdocusate sodium (liquid) 100 mg po bidmultivitamins 1 tab po dailyoxazepam 10 mg po bid:prn anxietyacetaminophen 325-650 mg po q6h:prn pain/feverbisacodyl 10 mg po/pr daily:prnsenna 1 tab po bid:prndischarge medications:nonedischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:primary:intracranial extension of invasive sqamous cell carcinomasecondary:resolved acute renal failure secondary to dehydrationpelvic mass of unknown etiologyatrial fibrillation, chronichypertensiondiabetes mellitus, type 2discharge condition:expireddischarge instructions:nonefollowup instructions:nonecompleted by:[2163-6-15]
