did not identify the etiology of herg.i. bleeding during this procedure, she might need colonoscopyto rule out right colonic bleeding. we will discuss with dr.[last name (stitle) 2987] this afternoon to recommend either regular colonoscopy orvirtual colonoscopy.colonoscopy [2188-10-23]: angioectasia in the cecum (thermaltherapy)diverticulosis of the sigmoid colonotherwise normal colonoscopy to cecumrecommendations: in patient carecapsule endoscopy. serial hematocritsbrief hospital course:assessment and plan: 75 year old woman on coumadin and plavix,s/p mechanical mvr, h/o gi bleed (ten years ago), now presentingwith gi bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic inr, c/bnasal bleeding following ngt placement..# gi bleed: the pt had three melenotic stools over 24 hrs, buthas stable hct on labs and is otherwise asymptomatic (withoutfatigue, shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, ororthostasis). ng lavage was negative for any coffee groundmaterial or bloody contents. egd did not reveal any source ofbleed. the patient also underwent colonoscopy, revealing ableeding avm, which was coagulated using thermal therapy. shewill need a capsule endoscopy as an out-patient in order toassess for additional, non-visualized avm in the small bowel.she was monitored with serial hematocrits, which trendeddownward precipitating transfusion with 1 unit of blood. heranti-coagulation with plavix and coumadin was held for herprocedures. after, she was re-started on coumadin with a heparinbridge to therapeutic inr, and her plavix was restarted afterbeing held for 7 days.  her hematocrit was stable at discharge.she was discharged once inr was therapeutic..# nasal trauma: following ngt placement, pt developed bleedingfrom nose that was quite profuse. packing was placed by entwhich was dislodged overnight. we suspect that a minorlac/contusion from ng tube in the setting of elevated inrprecipitated this event. she experienced no further epistaxisduring this admission..# mechanical mv replacement: goal inr is 2.5-3.5. the patient ison a higher dose of coumadin (5.5mg) to maintain this inr. perdiscussion with cardiology, her anti-coagulation was notreversed. all anticoagulation was held pending her egd, and shewas started on a heparin drip afterwards. after her colonoscopy,she was restarted on coumadin and a heparin drip was used tobridge the patient until her inr was therapeutic. at discharge,her inr was 2.6..# cad s/p 1 vessel cabg [2177]: the patient's beta blocker wasinitially held so as not to mask hypovolemia. it was re-startedafter the patient's procedures with normal heart rate andexcellent blood pressure control..# tia's (on plavix): plavix was restarted after being held for atotal of 7 days after her colonoscopy.medications
