admission date:  [2176-7-5]       discharge date:  [2176-7-19]service:addendum:  while on the floor, the patient developedhypotension and diaphoresis.  a code was called.  the patientwas intubated and taken to the unit.  at that point, thepatient put out melenic stools.  a ng tube was dropped withcoffee ground.  the patient's hematocrit stabilized and shewas not scoped.  her gi bleed was felt to be related to theaspirin, plavix, plus relafen.  all three medications wereheld.  the patient experienced a left pneumothorax duringleft subclavian line attempt.  she did not require a chesttube and the pneumothorax is resolving on its own.the patient was restarted on aspirin and protonix.  duringthis episode of hypotension, systolic to the 80s, thepatient's stroke progressed as evidenced by mri and furtherweakness in her left arm and loss of gag reflex.  inaddition, she experienced a non st elevation mi, felt to berelated to demand ischemia.  peak ck was 323, peak troponin31.0.  the patient was extubated without difficulty andcalled out to the floor.her systolic blood pressures were maintained by holdingantihypertensives with the exception of a beta blocker.  forthe loss of her gag reflex, the patient was kept n.p.o. andstarted on tube feeds via ng tube.  a peg was placed byinterventional radiology on [2176-7-17].  the stroke teamreevaluated the patient and felt that she would not toleratefurther anticoagulation necessary for carotid stentplacement.  they will follow-up with her, dr. [last name (stitle) ] or dr.[last name (stitle) ], in the stroke clinic in four to six weeks afterdischarge to reconsider a carotid stent with plavix.  thepatient developed copious secretions with her impairedswallow mechanism and a scopolamine patch was started withexcellent effect.her blood sugars were difficult to control and the [last name (un) ]team was consulted and an acceptable regimen of nph 30 unitsq.a.m. and q.h.s. with a sliding scale was deemed adequatecontrol.  the patient had a slightly elevated white countprior to discharge.  her u/a was positive with a ph of 9.0suggesting proteus.  ciprofloxacin was started.  the patientwill be discharged to [hospital3 7].additional discharge diagnosis:1.  loss of gag reflex secondary to cerebrovascular accident,subsequent placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomytube by interventional radiology on [2176-7-17].2.  non-st elevation myocardial infarction.3.  upper gastrointestinal bleed in the context of aspirin,plavix, and relafen.4.  urinary tract infection.discharge medications:1.  atorvostatin 20 mg p.o. q.d.2.  metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.3.  aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.4.  lansoprazole 30 mg per g tube b.i.d.5.  scopolamine patch transdermal q. 72 hours.6.  ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours for a 14 daycourse, last dose [2176-8-1].7.  albuterol and atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.8.  acetaminophen p.r.n.9.  insulin nph 30 units q.a.m., 30 units q.h.s.10. insulin sliding scale as follows:  fingersticks 80-100covered with 4 units; fingersticks 101-150 with 6 units;fingersticks 151-200 with 8 units; fingersticks 201-250 to becovered with 10 units; fingersticks 251-300 with 12 units;fingersticks 301-350 with 14 units; fingersticks 351 to 400with 16 units; fingersticks greater than 400 with 18 units ofregular insulin.all the above medications may be given per ng tube.  ideally,the patient will be restarted on an ace inhibitor once herrequirement for systolic blood pressure greater than 130related to her cva has passed.
