12/22/1990principal diagnoses :myocardial infarction .coronary artery disease .diabetes adult onset .history of cardiovasuclar accident .guaiac positive .iron deficiency anemia .history of present illness :the patient is a 76 year old man , who was transferred from tlowepeh hospital after an anterolateral mi , with post mi stuttering chest pain .his coronary risks factors are prior mi , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .he has no history of hypertension or family history .in 1960 , the patient had an mi complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .at that time he was placed on quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .he also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .on 12/15/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .he went to the tlowepeh hospital emergency room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was po2 73 , ph 7.44 , pco2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .his ekg showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral st depressions and t waves inversions .chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .he was tansferred to the coronary care unit where he was treated with iv nitroglycerin and diltiazem .he was ruled in for a non-q wave mi with peak cks of 531 , positive for mb .this course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on 12/17 , atrial fibrillation despite his quinidine .quinidine level on 12/16 was 1.4 .he had a new apical systolic murmur noted on 12/18 .he had mild chf , which was treated with captopril and prn lasix .he had recurrent chest pains noted on both 12/17 three times , 12/19 one time , and 12/21 .the episode on 12/21 was noteworthy for shortness of breath and st depression in v4-6 which required iv tng , which was used briefly that night .on 12/22 , he was transferred to norri hospital for evaluation of his post mi angina .medications on admission :b12 im , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , nitrol paste , lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , slow-k two tablets p.o.q.d. , captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.past medical history :notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left-sided cva in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .status post cholecystectomy , status post right inguinal herniorrhaphy .allergies :no known drug allergies .physical examination :temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .the patient was pain free and resting comfortably .his neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .his jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .his one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the right than the left .heart examination showed a pmi , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an s1 and s2 , ii/vi systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .rectal :guaiac positive .pulses :2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .laboratory examination :sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , bun and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , pt and ptt were 13.4/37.6 , quinidine was 2.5 , and cka was 53 .pre-intubation abg was ph of 7.39 , p02 81 , o2 saturation of 96% , c02 29 , total c02 18 .after intubation his ph was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pc02 28 , total c02 15 .repeat abg done later had a ph of 7.38 p02 of 247 , o2 saturation of 99.9% , pc02 22 , total c02 of 14 .magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal ekg changes .he became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .he was pain free with ekg st depressions laterally .around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg iv push times four .his heart rate went down to 60 .at this time , he was also given 25 mg po of lopressor .later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and iv fluid was started .he complained of continued nausea and vomiting .he was given compazine pr and was started on dopamine and then dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .he had a good urinary output .his systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his iv fluids were decreased .however , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate chf .the patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time iv fluid was increased , so was the dopamine and dobutamine .on the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .atropine x 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by doppler .oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .the patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as ng tube .he was still in some chf , mild to moderate .atropine one amp was given .at this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .there was a question of fleeting t waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead ekg .at this time 1 mg of glucagon iv was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .at this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .the rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.the patient was without respirations or blood pressure .the family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .autopsy was requested , however , the patient 's family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning
