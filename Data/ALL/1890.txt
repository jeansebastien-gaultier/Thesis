week abd pain,acute on chronic renal failure and new hyperbilirubinemia.unclear unifying diagnosis.# acute on chronic abdominal pain:  pt noted to have significantabdominal pain as well as increased [month/year (2) 4394] on admission.  ofnote, she had an extensive work up of her chronic abdominal painin the past with no clear cause.  abdominal ct was unrevealingfor any obvious source of her pain. gi was consulted whorecommended a sbft which did not reveal any significantpathology.  gi recommended bentyl for antispasmodic effect.  shewas also continued on her home ms contin and iv morphine forbreakthrough.  her pain persisted as did her [last name (lf) 4394], [first name3 (lf) ] thedecision was made to perform a diagnositc paracentesis underultrasound guidance.  200ml peritoneal fluid was removed.  thisrevealed 775 wbcs, but a lymphocytic/monocytic predominance withonly 1% polys making sbp unlikely.  fluid was sent for culturewhich showed no growth and flow cytometry which showed noevidence of all recurrence.  despite lack of evidence for sbp,she was started on zosyn empirically which was stopped on [5-2].she continued to have mild-moderate abdominal pain but was ableto eat full meals and had bms. she was continued on her homemscontin and morphine ir..# anthracycline-induced/ gvhd cardiomyopathy:  ef <20% on echofrom 2/[2174].  pt was maintained on diuresis as above, which wassubsequently held in the setting of rising creatinine withimprovement in creatinine. torsemide was slowly reintroduced anduptitrated to 40mg [hospital1 ] which caused another bump in creatinineto 3.0, so renal and cardiology were consulted. renal ultrasoundwas unrevealing.  she was then taken to the cath lab and placedon a milrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the ccu. her volumeoverload slowly improved and her peripheral edema/ascites slowlyimproved as well. a repeat echo showed improved ef to 40-45% onthe milrinone gtt. she was then started on solumedrol 30mg ivdue to a concern for gvhd directed towards myocardium.  afterfurther discussion between cardiology and her oncology team shewas also started on cellcept for further management of her gvhd. she did well on milrinone and lasix drip, but the drip wasstopped when her creatinine bumped to 3.0 and it was felt hervolume status was near maximization.  her milrinone was thendiscontiued and she was then transferred back to [hospital1 3242] for furthermanagement of her abdominal pain and gvhd.  she was continued ontorsemide for diuresis with close follow-up with her outpatientcardiologist.  of note, she had frequent alarms on telemetry fortachycardia that cardiologist felt was mostly due to artifact;her beta blocker was uptitrated.  repeat tte prior to dischargeshowed an ef of 35-40%.  she was discharged home on cellcept andprednisone for possible gvhd.# acute renal failure:  on admission cr was 2.7 (recent baselinewas 2), but at last discharge cr was 2.3.  renal saw the patientwho thought this was likely from overdiuresis (home torsemideregimen of 20mg [hospital1 ]) in conjunction with her [last name (lf) ], [first name3 (lf) ] recommendedholding diuresis. her cr subsequently improved, but in thesetting of her worsening [first name3 (lf) 4394] and her cardiomyopathy,decision was made to slowly add back diuresis, and eventuallyshe was up titrated to toresemide 40mg [hospital1 ] and her [last name (un) ] wasrestarted.  with this, however, her cr began to climb again to3.0.  given the delicate balance between her renal failurecardiomyopathy, cardiology/renal were consulted. given herdepressed ef, her rising cr was thought to be [3-9] volumeoverload. she was sent to the cath lab and started on amilrinone/lasix gtt and transfered to the ccu with a goaldiuresis of 1l per day. she was actively diuresed on hermilrinone and lasix drip with a total net negative of close to9l.  her cr then returned to baseline by time of discharge andshe was discharged home on torsemide.# hyperbilirubinemia:  unclear cause, could have been related toa viral infection but no transaminitis to support this.  ruq u/swithout cause for pain. this trended down to normal values andremained stable by time of discharge# leukocytosis: patient had uptrending wbc in setting ofstarting solumedrol, clutures were sent which revealed nogrowth..# h/o embolic stroke:  has new opening of pfo based on mostrecent echo which likely contributed to her recent stroke.  shewas maintained on coumadin 4mg daily, but anticoagulation washeld on day of paracentesis and remained subtherapeutic forseveral days, so she was maintained on a heparin drip to bridgeher to a therapeutic inr [3-10]. she was maintained on a decreaseddose of coumadin throughout hospital admission with inr withingoal between 2
