record date: 2083-02-26 attending admission notehpi:  54 year old woman with h/o dm, htn, and depression who is transferred to psh from missouri baptist hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  she has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  she has had an extensive gi work-up in the past including multiple abdominal ct scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  all studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  she has been treated with multiple medications, including reglan, ativan, compazine, and zelnorm without much effect.  she is currently taking neurontin and cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her pcp started her on ms contin in december since nothing else seemed to be helping.  the pt states that the ms contin helped during the month of december, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  the pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  she has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  the pain is not necessarily related to eating.  yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  she received some iv morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.	at missouri baptist hospital, her ms contin was held, but when her bp went up, she was restarted on it.  they also started clonidine bid for her uncontrolled htn.  it appears that a afp level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  however, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated cea level of 11.1.problemsdiabetes mellitus : since 2060's, poorly controlledhypertension gastroparesis : n/v due to diabetesretinopathy : due to aodm, s/p first laser treatment 3/81, found to have swelling of the optic discs in 8/82 and evaluated at pchs/p cholecystectomy s/p tah/bso : menopause at age 46 medications (on transfer)heparin 5000 u sq bidreglan 10 mg iv q 6 hourshydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (25mg tablet take 1) po qam , for high blood pressureinsulin 70/30 human 70-30 u/ml vial sc as directed , 25u sq before breakfast and 15u before dinner.nexium 40 mg po qdlisinopril 20mg tablet po qam medications (as an outpatient)asa (acetylsalicylic acid) 325 mg (325mg tablet take 1) po qd cymbalta (duloxetine) 60mg capsule dr po qam x 30 dayshydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (25mg tablet take 1) po qam , for high blood pressureinsulin 70/30 human 70-30 u/ml vial sc as directed , 60u sq before breakfast and 40u before dinner.lipitor (atorvastatin) 10mg tablet po qhs lisinopril 40mg tablet po qam ms contin (morphine controlled release) 15mg tablet sa po q12h neurontin (gabapentin) 300 mg (300mg capsule take 1) po tid potassium chloride slow rel.
