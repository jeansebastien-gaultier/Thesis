an attempted lap banding on 8/14/2005 .  unfortunately duringthe surgery , there was damage to the thoracic aorta and theattempted lap banding turned into an exploratory laparotomy ,median sternotomy , left thoracotomy , and aortic injury repair.he suffered cardiac arrest on the operating room table. lefthemothorax and cardiac tamponade secondary to the descendingthoracic aortic laceration which was repaired intraoperatively ,and his abdomen was left open temporarily with a ??____?? bag andpartial vac sponge , and he was admitted to the unit on pressors.hospital course: notable for a couple of major events over thepast couple of months , and we will go to those major events. on0/2/2005 , mr. benck was weaned off pressors. on the6/12/2005 , the mediastinal chest tube was discontinued. on2/3/2005 , his creatinine started to increase. on 7/25/2005and 5/8/2005 , the patient was bronched for respiratory distresswith resolution of the respiratory distress. on 1/1/2005 , hewas taken down to the operating room to increase the size of theendotracheal tube. his abdominal wound dehisced en route , a jtube was placed , a left triple lumen catheter was placed , and hisexploratory laparotomy wound was able to be closed with waxsponge to be on top of the wound closure. on 10/15/2005 , he hada tap of his left chest. there was fluid collection there fromthe left thoracotomy. on 11/8/2005 , the left chest tube wasplaced and on 3/5/2005 , a left chest tube was discontinued. on7/9/2005 , he was trached and two chest tubes were placed and aleft vats was completed again , because of a persisted fluidcollection. on 1/19/2005 , a right picc was placed and thetriple lumen and his a line were discontinued. on 9/0/2005 , atee was done that showed normal valves with no vegetations and nomajor regional wall motion abnormalities. on 3/1/2005 , histrach was changed to a #7. on 11/20/3005 , his trach was changedto a #8 portex. on 11/12/2005 , he had a renal ultrasound foragain a slowly rising creatinine that did not show any evidenceof hydronephrosis. on 10/26/2005 , cvvh was started after quintonwas placed in the right ij , on 11/10/2005 , his #8 portex trachwas replaced with a #8 shiley. on 7/15/2205 , a clot developedin the cvvh catheter. on 10/1/2005 , a wound which was beingseen periodically by i&amp;d has had periodic wound i&amp;ds and vacchanges. on 6/28/2005 , the right ij quinton was discontinuedand a right ij tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed. on7/9/2005 , he had a metabolic heart and began to trach collarfor increasing amounts of time. on 6/3/2005 and 12 ,there was report that his j tube had been slightly displaced andthen had been pushed in by the icu team. the patient developedleft lower quadrant pain. he was sent down for the ct of theabdomen and pelvis , and now the j tube was not fully visualized ithink because it is radiolucent to extravasation of contrast wasnot seen and surgery team felt that it was okay to continue tubefeeds safely which we have with no problems. on 6/1/2005 , hedesaturated when he went down for an ultrasound for the leftupper extremity in order to rule out clot because again the leftupper extremity had been swelling , so no studies was completed.he developed rigor short after with the temperature to 104 , somemild hypotension and tachycardia. tee at the bedside show nodissection or intimal flap blood cultures were drawn. his piccwas discontinued and the tip was sent for culture , and hereceived doses of levofloxacin and vancomycin. he was able toeventually j-collar through this. on 6/5/2005 , a 3 out of 4gram negative rods which ended up being enterobacter werecultured out. we believe that he suffered a transient bacteremiafrom the picc. levofloxacin was started and id was consultedbecause the enterobacter was resistant about everything exceptamikacin and imipenem. on 10/6/2005 , allergy was also consultedand restarted an imipenem desensitization process which he hascompleted , and he is now on imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours for atotal course of 15 days that was started on 10/6/2005 , and apicc was replaced. today , he was planning to go to hemodialysisin order to exchange the dialysis catheter over wire not that itis not functioning but because of this transient bacteremia wewould like to give them a new hemodialysis catheter. he has beenable to get hemodialysis with , though some 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 unitsof heparin has to be given beforehand in order for the cathetersto flush well , and he will also be going for left upper extremityeither ultrasound or venogram to again rule out a clot in theleft upper extremity due to the increased swelling. his lasttemperature here is 98.3 today. his blood pressure runssystolics 90 to 110 with a heart rate in the 90s to 110s. he ison no drips or iv fluids , just his full strength nepro of 55which is his goal and he is essentially anuric , but when we dostraight caths which we tend to do once every 1-2 days , he putsout usually 100-200 cc of urine and he has been j-collaringsuccessfully now for over three or four days saturations in the95% to 100% and an fio2 of 40%. ot and pt have also been seeinghim.review of systems:neurologically , his mental status has much improved. he hadinitially some icu delirium after the initial surgery that hasreally greatly improved. he right now is on no major moodstabilizers or antipsychotics. we do give him oxycodone forpain , which he really has had to use.pulmonarywise , we have kept him on j-collar when he does need togo for a procedure we do send down the vent in case just becausehe is still fairly large person and may need the ventilatorysupport for positioning. he is right now on combivent and duonebnebulizers p.r.n.cardiovascularwise , his blood pressure has been stable and so hashis tachycardia. the beta-blocker that he was initially onlopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d. was stopped secondary to the imipenemdesensitization the feeling being that if he did has ananaphylactic reaction , the epinephrine needed unopposed actionand we did not want any beta-blocker on board. we have held andwould continue it starting at a low dose after he completes hiscourse of imipenem.gastrointestinalwise , he is on tube feeds which he tolerates verywell and there are no issues any more with the j-tube position.we are requesting a bedside speech and swallow official consult ,though he has been tolerating ice chips and ice cream withabsolutely no problems on p.o. he is also on pepcid iv for giprophylaxis.genitourinarywise , he gets hemodialysis every other day. theyhave been taking 4-5 liters per day and again with straightcatheterizing once every 1-2 days and usually get about a 100 ccto 200 cc of urine. renal has been following him , and they areunhappy with his course of dialysis. again , the hemodialysiscatheter is to be wire exchanged today , which is 10/29/2005 , butagain they have been able to use it just fine so far.hematologywise , he is on heparin subcutaneous 10 , 000 units t.i.d.endocrinewise , we have been checking his fingersticks and he isright now on lantus 15 units subcutaneous b.i.d. with a slidingscale for coverage. he has just been following the fingersticksthat way and imipenem , he is to continue for 14-day course totalof imipenem 250 mg every 12 hours. the first dose was given inthe a.m. on 10/6/2005 , and there are no new culture resultsafter the gram-negative enterobacter was found. all othersurveillance and urine culture have been negative.escription document: 5-1964207 mffocusdictated by: cremins ,
