cath showed one vessel disease. he was notangioplastied. the patient had an mi at that time which wasmedically managed. the patient did well until july of 1995 whenthe patient had another anterior mi , massive , treated withthrombolytics. cardiac catheterization at that time revealed a 99%proximal rca and serial 70% lad lesions. the patient also wasnoted to have a severe lv dysfunction with an ejection fraction of28% and his mi was complicated by a complete heart block and a dualchamber pacemaker was placed. at that time the patient wasconsidered to be a surgical candidate secondary to high risk. inaugust of 1995 the patient was admitted for non q wave mi with apeak ck of 798 , positive mb fraction , and was again treated withthrombolysis with tpa. the patient did well with no

anexercise tolerance test with oxygen consumption measured at 11.8ml/kg. the patient exercised for 6 minutes and reached a maximalheart rate of 114 and stopped secondary to dyspnea. given thepatient's poor functional status he presented for cardiaccatheterization and complete workup for cardiac transplant. thepatient admits no shortness of breath at rest but with 1-2 flightsof steps. he also

originally for a workupfor cardiac transplant. the patient had acardiac transplant labs drawn , had a ppd placed , which was negativewith positive controls. the patient had a psychiatry consult.hepatitis serology for hepatitis b and c were negative. thepatient was kept on heparin at therapeutic levels and was diuresedwith lasix. his captopril was also increased. the patient wasalso treated with isordil. at this point the patient wasreassessed and it was thought that he might be a candidate for arevascularization. with this in mind , the patient was scheduledfor a ett thallium which if positive for ischemia he would go for acardiac catheterization. in the meantime the patient was medicallymanaged , diuresed of three to four liters over the several days ofadmission. his isordil was increased and he was continued on aspirin anddigoxin , on mevacor. further transplant labs revealed a tsh of2.8 , t3 of 159 , t4 of 7.8. urine 24 hour collection total volumewas 4200 cc , creatinine of 29 , urine protein less than assay. thepatient had his ett thallium which showed a question of septalischemia with a fixed apical defect. the patient went 6 minutes ona standard bruce protocol with a maximum heart rate of 156 , stoppedsecondary to chest pain and 1 mm st segment depressions. thepatient went to cardiac catheterization the following day. thepatient's cardiac catheterization revealed three vessel diseasewith a 100% lad. his catheterization film was evaluated by cardiacsurgery , dr. wolinski who believed that the patient would not benefitfrom a cabg. given this , the patient received a continuedtransplant workup of a ct of the abdomen , as well as a dentalconsult , with a planned tooth extraction , with appropriatepremedication with amoxicillin , and holding of his heparin. thepatient tolerated this well. preliminary report on the ct of theabdomen showed a small single less than 1 cm hepatic lesion. thepatient was medically stable on discharge.the
