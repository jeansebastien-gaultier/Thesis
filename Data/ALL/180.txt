[known lastname 2809] is a 58 year old gentleman s/p liver transplantrelated to chronic hcv infection, myopathy (? steroid induced),history of prior multiple asymptomatic embolic infarcts prior totransplantation, who presents with three day prodrome of generalmalaise, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, followed by acutechange in mental status with witnessed partial complex seizurein the [hospital1 18] ed.1) neuro: seizure - initially a code stroke was called in the ed, but ctimaging and later, mri, showed no evidence of acute infarction.initial labs notable for presence of only serum benzodiazepineson tox screening and acute on chronic renal failure. etiology ofseizure was thought to be areas of prior cortical infarcts insetting of gastrointestinal illness. the patient was intubatedin the emergency department and promptly extubated at 2am in theneuro icu the same evening. the morning following admission thepatient's examination was notable for marked encephalopathy. hewas changed from phenytoin to oxcarbazepine (trileptal) givenmultiple long term side effects of phenytoin, and with normalhepatic function, but renal impairment and keppra did not seem awise choice. lumbar puncture was attempted with light sedationwithout success. it was re-attempted with fentanyl and midazolamfor monitored conscious sedation and revealed 1 wbc, 0 rbc,normal protein and glucose. he was transferred to the floorafter an eeg done on the [7-18] revealed noabnormalities and showed a normal background. encephalopathy - on the floor, the patient's exam was notablefor continued encephalopathy, but he was evidently notdelerious. his main abnormalities were frontal dysfunction (asexhibited by impulsiveness, stimulus-bound behaviors,desinhibition, bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes, amarked inability to switch mindset) and memory (as exhibited byanososgnosia, orientation to place and time, as well as notimprinting new information, and working memory (the patientstayed in-task, and had sufficent attention to perform, butcouldn't complete the tasks). clinically he continued to improveslowly but surely, an eeg done on [10-21] showed 7 hz background,but otherwise normal. per his wife, his level of cognitivefunctioning at home was high, as for example he was able todiscuss politics.2) cardio: nstemi - patient was noted to have elevated troponin enzymesto 0.31 with ekg without ischemic changes. he was started onaspirin, beta blocker, atorvastatin. cardiology consultation wasobtained and additionally recommended echocardiogram whichrevealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, nofocal wall motion abnormalities (poor data quality though),lvef>55%, mild aortic valve stenosis. his nstemi was thoughtrelated to demand related ischemia in the setting ofcatecholamine surge associated with seizure. he should bescheduled for an exercise stress test as an outpatient.3) fen acute renal failure - patient's has prior hepato-renalsyndrome now with baseline creatinine of 1.9-2. admissioncreatinine notable for 2.4. he was noted to have low urineoutput. he received vigorous iv hydration with improved cr to1.6, however this was likely a sampling error because all thelines of his cellcount were down on this blooddraw as well,repeat labs showed a creat of 2.0 and his [hospital1 ] back to the oldvalues. his medications were renally dosed. he was started onthiamine, folate and mvi.4) liver transplantationtransaminase levels on admission were wnl. hepatologyconsultation was obtained and recommended continuing with hisprior regimen of immunosuppressive agents. no changes were made.5) ida broad spectrum of csf studies were sent despite the normalcell count. varicella pcr and cmv pcr negative, remainderpending. mrsa isolation negative. vre swab negative.cryptococcal antigen gram stain, fluid culture, fungalculture-preliminary,acid fast culture, viral culture were all(preliminary) negative.6) ppx, reactivation and reconditioningfor prophylaxis, he was put on heparin, pneumoboots, teds, andpt and ot were consulted to evaluate and treat him.medications on admission:prograf 1mg [hospital1 ]imuran 50mg [hospital1 ]cellcept (mycophenidate mofetil) 1000mg [hospital1 ]bactrimmetoprolol 50mg [hospital1 ]clindagelasa 81mg dailyfosamax 35mg q frimarinol 5mg qpm and qhssimethicone 80mg [hospital1 ]calcum 500mg + d [hospital1 ]ambien (zolpidem) 5mg qhsdoxazosin 1.5mg qhshydroxyzine hcl 50mg [hospital1 ]ritalin 15mg qamremeron 7.5 qhsprilosec 20mg dailyeffexor 37.5mg dailyflorinef 0.1mg dailylasix 20mg dailykayexylatelipitor 10mg dailylisinopril 5mg dailypercocet one tab qid prncosopt one drop to left eye [hospital1 ]alphagan 0.15% to left eye [hospital1 ]ofloxacin 0.3% eye drop to left eye qidprednisolone 1% eye drop to left eye qidhomatropine 5% eye drop to left eye [hospital1 ]discharge medications:1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. bisacodyl 5 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: two (2)tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po daily (daily) as needed.3. tacrolimus 1 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2 timesa day).4. mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet potwice a day.5. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.6. alendronate 35 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qfri (everyfriday).7. doxazosin 1 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po hs (at bedtime).8. hydroxyzine hcl 25 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po bid (2times a day).9. venlafaxine 37.5 mg capsule, sust. release 24 hr sig: one (1)capsule, sust. release 24 hr po daily (daily).10. fludrocortisone 0.1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).11. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: one (1)injection [hospital1 ] (2 times a day).12. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg tablet sig: one (1)tablet po mwf (monday-wednesday-friday) as needed for ppx.13. oxcarbazepine 300 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2times a day).14. dorzolamide-timolol 2-0.5 % drops sig: one (1) dropophthalmic [hospital1 ] (2 times a day).15. brimonidine 0.15 % drops sig: one (1) drop ophthalmic q 12h(every 12 hours).16. ofloxacin 0.3 % drops sig: one (1)  ophthalmic four timesdaily ().17. prednisolone acetate 1 % drops, suspension sig: one (1) dropophthalmic qid (4 times a day).18. homatropine hbr 5 % drops sig: one (1)  ophthalmic twicedaily ().19. famotidine 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q24h (every24 hours).20. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet pobid (2 times a day).21. atorvastatin 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).22. hexavitamin     tablet sig: one (1) cap po daily (daily).23. thiamine hcl 100 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).24. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital3 1107] [hospital ] [hospital 1108] rehab unit at[hospital6 1109] -
