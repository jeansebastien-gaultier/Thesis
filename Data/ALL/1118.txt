admission date :11/17/2004discharge date :11/26/2004operations / procedures :dobutamine stress test , cardiac ultrasound , egd , chest x-ray , picc placement .the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus , hypertension , copd , hypercholesterolemia , depression and chf who was lying in bed on the night prior to admission when she developed left-sided chest pain located in the mid-breast region with some fluttering her chest .the patient radiated down her left arm associated with some nausea , no shortness of breath , cough , vomiting , diarrhea .she slept through the night , woke with persistent pain .she went with her sister &apos;s husband to la community hospital where she was given sublingual nitroglycerin with complete relief of pain .she refused ambulance to the emergency room and was driven to well general hospital emergency room by her sister .she arrived pain free .she was given aspirin , lopressor and insulin for hyperglycemia .ekg was unchanged compared to the prior ekg several months ago .hospital course :the patient was admitted to team four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for mi .hospital course by system :1. cardiovascular :the patient ruled out for mi by cardiac markers .the patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of copd , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .the next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .this echo showed lv ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .however , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .it was suboptimally imaged , so there was no rvsp given .the patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her egd on 11/17/04 .this responded to fluid bolus .the patient was then transferred to medicine team d given her tenuous hemodynamic status .the patient , several days later 11/23 , underwent another dobutamine stress test .this stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an ef from this test was 76% .clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .2. infectious disease :on hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .the next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential uti .she continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .she was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .her urine legionella antigen was negative .on 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .she was started on vancomycin for this .these bacteria turned out to be mrsa and she was continued on her vancomycin .she had picc line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .3. gi :the patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .gi was consulted for an egd , however , while she was in the endoscopy suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her egd .the egd did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .4. shortness of breath :as mentioned above , the patient did develop mrsa pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .at most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .this was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest ct .5. derm :several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .she was started on some miconazole cream .the rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .the rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
