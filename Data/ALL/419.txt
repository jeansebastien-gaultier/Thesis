required a dobhoff and tubefeeds to supplement his nutrition.  once he was medically stablehe was transferred to rehab for further rehabilitation.  priortodischarge there was some concern regarding his rising alk phoslevels, but they trended back down and stabilized so it wasdecided to send him out with continued follow up.  he nowreturnswith findings of eleveated alk phos at rehab at 650, ast

hospital course:admission liver duplex demonstrated no specific son[name (ni) 493]findings to explain abnormal liver function tests. hepaticvasculature was patent with normal flow and resistive indices.there was small-volume ascites. on [1-22] a cholangiogram was doneto assess for ductal dilatation and assess the vasculature. postprocedure, he spiked a temperature to 104. he was transferred tothe sicu for management as he dropped his bp. he was treatedwith iv fluids and antibiotics were started (meropenum and vanco[1-22]). blood cultures grew klebsiella oxytoca and vre(enterococcus facium). antibiotics were switched to dapto andmeropenum after 3 days to daptomycin and meropenum. he wastreated for a total of 12 days of dapto ([date range (1) 81979]) andmeropenum ([date range (1) 81980]). subsequent blood cultures on several dayswere negative. a right picc line was inserted ([1-27])for ivantibiotics.biopsy findings demonstrated no intrahepatic duct dilationvisualized and no bile leak at the hepaticojejunal anastomosissite. a biopsy was then performed with features representingindeterminate to mild acute cellular rejection. this was treatedby increasing his prograf with a target trough level of 15.prograf levels increased to 15-16 and as high as 18. dosage wasadjusted. lfts were notable for the alk phos dropping to 612from 963, but then alk phos continued to rise.on [1-28], an mrcp was performed to assess for biliary obstructionor leak. this demonstrated diffuse mild-to-moderate dilatationof the entire intrahepatic biliary system. there were severalfoci of intrahepatic biliary stenosis as well as a 2-cm segmentof the distal cbd which demonstrated wall thickening andassociated luminal stenosis. distally, the segment abutted theanastomosis of cbd and jejunum. between the diaphragm and theright lobe of the liver, was a small hematoma. there was a smallamount of free fluid around the hepatic and splenic flexure.on [1-29], he was re-biopsied with findings concerning for biliaryobstruction or ischemia. prograf was adjusted. on [2-3], acholangiogram was done showing no obvious dilation ofintrahepatic ducts and possible stricture at lower common bileduct close to the anastomosis site with the contrast flowingfreely down to the small bowel. an internal-external biliarydraining catheter was placed. after this procedure, lfts trendeddown with alk phos decreasing to 446 from 1155 overapproximately six days on [2-10].he developed severe bilateral upper and lower extremity tremorsand ataxic gait likely from prograf toxicity causing asignificant decline in his ability to ambulate. neurology wasconsulted. this was felt to be related to the prograf, butthyroid function studies and a mri of the head were done toassess his cerebellum. tfts were significant for a slightly lowt3 otherwise tsh and t4 were normal. the mri was read by neuroand neurosurgery who felt that the mri was unchanged compared toprevious in [2149-11-8], prior to starting on immunosuppression.the two left hemipheric lesions were stable in size,non-enhancing with contrast, and of unclear etiology. his csfprofile [12-8] was normal, with no evidence of inflammation orpleiocytosis. he had csf pcr negative at that time forhsv/ebv/cmv/[male first name (un) 2326]/[last name (lf) ], [first name3 (lf) ] there was no need to repeat a spinaltap. hcv viral load was undetectable. it was not clear what thelesions  represented, but given no further growth or lack ofenhancement, infection or malignancy were remote possibilities.a repeat mri brain without contrast (as lesions did not enhanceand given risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenicfibrosing dermopathy)was recommended in 3 months to re-evaluatefor evolution of these lesions. with adjustment of prograf, thetrough levels decreased to 10 and the tremors diminished.consequently, his mobility improved.nutritionally, he required a feeding tube initially, butdemonstrated sufficient caloric intake to remove the feedingtube. he was tolerating a regular diet.vital signs were stable and he remained afebrile. pt worked withdaily and recommended [hospital 41518] rehab. he was accepted at[hospital1 ].on the day of discharge, his ptc was removed, but the oldinsertion site continued to leak some bile. a urostomy pouch wasplaced over this site to collect and record volume of output.the roux tube that was present since his liver translant surgerywas kept capped. site was without redness or drainage.twice weekly labs should be drawn for cbc, chem 10, lfts andtrough
