his hct wasfound to be 22.8. he was transfused 2 units of prbc's. gi teamwas consulted regarding a potential upper endoscopy. however,they felt egd would require elective intubation and thereforethe procedure was deferred. the patient was aggressively fluidresuscitated and his urine output remained adequate. thefollowing day his cr dropped to 1.3 and he was sent for a ctawith pe protocol which was indeterminate for pe due to motionartifact but did not show thrombus in the aortoiliac or pelvicveins. serial hct were trended and remained stable. an echo wasattempted [2-1] but the quality was suboptimal secondary to thepatient's large body habitus. he still had a significantsupplemental oxygen requirement.over the next few days in the icu his respiratory statusremained tenuous. he was started on intermittent lasix boluses[2196-2-1] which resulted in large diuresis and he was able to beweaned to nasal cannula. on [2196-2-2], he was started on 20mg polasix daily and was given 40mg iv lasix as well as a dose ofdiamox. he again responded with a brisk diuresis but then becamehypotensive overnight requiring 2.5l of fluid boluses. his hctin the am was 21 and he was transfused one unit prbc's. thepatient also developed an urticarial rash on [2196-2-2] and this wasattributed to having switched his cipro from iv to po. the ciprowas therefore discontinued and he was started on levofloxacin.his rash has virtually resolved at time of this dictation.he remained on the vancomycin and levofloxacin for the pneumoniafor a total of 7 day course, stop date [2196-2-10]. he is alsoreceiving flagyl for a presumed c. difficile colitis given hisstool volume. it should be noted that he has had 2 negativestool for c. diff cultures. his treatment with flagyl willcontinue for a total of 7 day course. a flexi seal system wasplaced rectally for stool containment and protection ofpatient's skin given his large body habitus. cholestyramine wasstarted as well.he was also seen by psychiatry for his anxiety and depressionand it was recommended to increase his celexa to 40 mg dailyfrom 30 mg and to avoid benzodiazepines as this would put him atrisk for delirium.he was evaluated by physical therapy and is being recommendedfor rehab after his acute hospital stay.medications on admission:lisinopril 10mg po dailylevothyroxine 137 mcg po dailylasix 20 mg po dailycelexa 30 mg po dailydischarge medications:1. lisinopril 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. levothyroxine 137 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).3. furosemide 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).4. citalopram 20 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po daily (daily).5. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution fornebulization sig: one (1) neb inhalation q4h (every 4 hours) asneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.6. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1) nebinhalation every six (6) hours.7. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12 hours).8. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: one (1) mlinjection tid (3 times a day).9. levothyroxine 75 mcg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).10. diphenhydramine hcl 25 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule poq6h (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritis.11. furosemide 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 timesa day).12. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po hs (at bedtime) asneeded for insomnia.13. citalopram 20 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).14. miconazole nitrate 2 % powder sig: one (1) appl topicalthree times a day: apply to skin folds.15. hydromorphone 2 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4h (every 4hours) as needed for pain.16. cholestyramine-sucrose 4 gram packet sig: two (2) packet pobid (2 times a day).17. vancomycin 1500 mg iv q 12h start: [2196-2-3]stop date [2196-2-10]18. levofloxacin in d5w 750 mg/150 ml piggyback sig: seven[age over 90 1230]y (750) mg intravenous q24h (every 24 hours): stopdate [2196-2-10].19. metronidazole in nacl (iso-os) 500 mg/100 ml piggyback sig:five hundred (500) mg intravenous q8h (every 8 hours): stop date[2196-2-11].20. insulin regular human 100 unit/ml solution sig: one (1) doseinjection four times a day as needed for per sliding scale.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital3 1107] [hospital ] hospital - [location (un) 38]discharge diagnosis:choledocholithiasisupper gastrointestinal bleedacute blood loss anemiapneumoniaanxietydepressiondischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:you were admitted to the hopsital with gallstones and underwenta procedure called an ercp which looks inside of your biliarysystem. you then had your galbladder removed. you did well inthe post operative period and your diet was advanced.you should avoid fried and/or greasey foods;
