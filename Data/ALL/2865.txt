hypertension; decreasedt-4; meningitis as a child. allergies: none known.physical examination: heart rate 65; blood pressure 120/90;temperature 97.5. the heent exam wasunremarkable. carotids 2+ with normal upstrokes and no bruits.the lungs were clear. the cardiac exam revealed a regular rate andrhythm; s1 and s2; no s3; ii/vi systolic murmur at the left uppersternal border radiating to the apex; no rubs; pmi nondisplaced;jvd 6 cm. the abdomen revealed a cholecystectomy scar. theextremities revealed strong pulses and no bruits. the neuro examwas nonfocal.laboratory examination: white count 9.4; hematocrit 42;platelets 390; sodium 143; potassium 5.2;chloride 107; co2 30; bun 26; creatinine 1.8; glucose 90; pt 12.6;ptt 29.8; quinidine level 3; calcium 9.2. the ekg revealed dualchamber 100% paced; no atrial activity; rate 65; intervals 0.16 ,0.20 and 0.50. an ekg from 2/14 revealed sinus brady at 50;intervals 0.22 , 0.12; appropriate qtc; left atrial hypertrophy.urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.025 , ph 5 ,presence of urate crystals. the chest x-ray showed no chf orinfiltrate; cardiomegaly as well as a dual chamber pacer present.hospital course: the patient was admitted to the cardiology hassteam. the metteand health center team preferred to stop thequinidex at this time and observe him for recurrence of atrialfibrillation with plans to start norpace if this occurred. therewas no recurrence of atrial fibrillation while in-house. the dddremained in place with settings as per the admission note. he hada cardiac work up consisting of an echocardiogram revealing anejection fraction of 30% with inferior and apical hypokinesisconsistent with location of the old mi. he was maintained onisordil and atenolol as part of his admission regimen withoutsymptoms while in-house. on the prior to discharge , he underwent astandard bruce ett. he exercised nine minutes stopping secondaryto fatigue with a peak heart rate of 105; blood pressure increasedfrom 100/80 to 124/78. there were no st-t wave changes frombaseline. he was thought to be maximally medicated. his pulsepressure product at rest was excellent and well maintained , and hewas asymptomatic. he was maintained on his current cardiacregimen.he was noted to have a mildly elevated bun at 26 and creatinine 1.8on admission. he was found to have urate crystals in his urine.his bun decreased to 23 and creatinine 1.3 prior to discharge. wewill consider alkalyzing his urine if we suspect a true uratenephropathy.disposition: he was discharged to home on 8/26/90 . medications ondischarge: isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.;
