complaint:weakness, achynessmajor surgical or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:. boiseau is a pleasant 65 yo man with paroxysmal atrialfibrillation, bipolar disorder and h/o etoh abuse who presentedto the ed today with complaints of r arm pain, achiness and"feeling off."his wife reports that he did not complain of any of the above onthe morning of admission, either. per his wife, the pt awokeearly this morning, which is unusual, and was c/o some rshoulder pain (the site of the vaccination. he was just a little"off," and he fell in the living room. both he and his wife denyloss of consciousness.past medical history:1.   bipolar disorder.2.   history of rheumatic heart disease.3.   status post clipping of cerebral aneurysm in [2167] at the     [hospital1 756].4.   gastroesophageal reflux disease.5.   history of hepatitis.6.   status post cholecystectomy.7.   status post appendectomy.8.   history of alcohol abuse.9.   fe deficient anemia followed by hematology and on iv irontherapy10.  atrial fibrillation not on warfarin for ? fallsocial history:lives with wife, 3 cigs per day for 50 years, last etoh was 3months ago when he had 1 drink.family history:ncbrief hospital course:in the ed, he was initially hypotensive (70s/40s) andbradycardic (50s). he was treated as a beta-blocker overdose andgiven ivf (~2l ns) and glucagon, with improvement in hishemodynamics. he had a cxr, cta and ct torso, all of which wereunrevealing..he recieved empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (metronidazole500 mg iv, levofloxacin 750 mg iv and vancomycin 1 g iv) and wastransferred to the medical floor. on the floor, he developedrigors, fevers to 104.1 with tachycardia to the 110s andhypoxemia to 88% on ra. there was no witnessed aspiration event,although the pt does have a h/o aspiration for which he wastreated at an osh.  he received a dose of diazepam for possibleetoh withdrawal that had no immediate effect. of note, the ptdid receive a pneumococcal vaccination on the day prior toadmission..on transfer to the icu, the pt reported feeling well. he deniedshortness of breath, and reported that the arm pain that hepresented with had gotten better. he denies lightheadedness,neck stiffness, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, abdominalpain, dysuria..icu course;fever hypotension/shock: given the pt's history of aspiration,considered aspiration pneumonitis. although he did not have awitnessed aspiration event, his wife reports a nearly identicaladmission ~2 years ago. also in the differential were pulmonaryembolism, an intrabdominal source of infection with associatedsepsis, a reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine-whichchronologically fits well with the story/cytokine like effect,neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome. pe isunlikely given his normal cta. an intrabdominal infection isunlikely given his normal ct scan and abdominal exam. a reactionto the pneumococcal vaccine is the most likely factor at thispoint as there is no signs of infection/endocrine phenomenon.his ck is not elevated, and he is not rigid on exam, making nmsunlikely. he is, if anything, hyporeflexive, making serotoninsyndrome unlikely.  as his hypotension was accompanied bybradycardia it is felt likely that an etiology could be betablocker overdose (not felt to be intentional).[initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) 104] stim was negative, no growth from his cultres at 48hours.  tsh was normal.  an ekg showed 1st degree avb.  he wasgiven iv fluids, stress dose steroids, vanco/levo/flagyl forbroad empiric coverage and

clinical suspicion of pneumonia was low.an echo did not show any vegetations.pneumovax was added to his allergy list..#hypoxemia-pt had 02 req of 2-3l prior to transfer. he did nothave symptoms such as cough/sob/wheeze. pt was given aggressivehydration on admission for hypotension. resultant cxr showedthis as well as crackles on exam.  he autodiuresed once his bphad improved and his cxr showed improvement in hilar edema.however  there was question of lll infiltrate on cxr [7-8] andpersistent 3l nc o2 requirement.  vanco was discontinued andlevo/flagyl was continued until diuresis and repeat pa and latto assess lll, cxr showed a left retrocardiac density (pna vsatelectasis)-however he no longer had an oxygen requirement evenwith ambulation.  he will follow up with his

clotin your lungs.  you received antibiotics as infection wassuspected.  you had no evidence of a problem with your adrenalglands, or thyroid.  it is believed that your low blood pressurewas due to a reaction from your pneumovax that was given the daybefore.  also, since your heart rate was low it is possible thatthis was due to a high dose of beta blocker.in addition you had two episodes of fecal incontinence which youhave had in the past when you are not home.  your rectal examwas normal. if this does not improve when you go home you needto seek medical attention. you have been given a
