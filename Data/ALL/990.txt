the neurosurgery team felt that these aneurysms wereunlikely to be the cause of the patient??????s bleeding.  since therewould be no further surgical intervention, the patient wastransferred to the neurology team in the icu.past medical history:esophageal cacadmechanical mitral valves/p cabg x3htnasbestosisbilateral carotid endarterectomysocial history:married, lives with wife.  occasional etoh use.family history:no history of known aneurysms.physical exam:vs 100.4 (t max 101.2)  p 89  bp 92/46   rr 14   100% ragen;

or, if seizure occurredinitially and trauma sustained during the convulsion led tobleeding. the patient was loaded with dilantin and theninitiated on keppra for seizure prophylaxis since this does notinteract with coumadin. he had no further seizure activity inthe icu. after transfer to the medical floor, the patient had anepisode of lower extremity shaking while asleep in a chair,witnessed only by wife. this was thought unlikely to representseizure activity, and more likely myoclonic jerks during sleep.neurology was called to see patient at this time. 20 minute eegwas done, showing no epileptiform activity. the patient willcontinue on keppra for at least 6 months. he will follow-up withdr. [last name (stitle) ] in neurology..#. ich:the patient underwent a conventional angiogram which did show2-mm aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the originof the anterior temporal branch. however, this was thought notto be responsible for his left sylvian fissure hemorrhage asthere was no history of headache at onset and thehemorrhage itself was located remote from the aneurysm and therewas no blood in the basal cisterns at all. he did have anintraparenchimal bleed with a sah component that may have beendue to amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds in gre. these added tohis age and pv white matter disease placed him at a higher riskfor a new bleed. however, he needed to remain anticoagulatedbecause of his mechanical valve. thoracic surgery was consultedabout the possibility of pursuing a valve replacement for abiological prosthesis to avoid anticoagulation. however, thesurgical risk was determined to outweigh the benefit of avoidinganticoagulation. the patient remained off anticoagulation due tothis high risk. on [7-18], the patient developed new right-sidedweakness and mri showed new left mca infarct. this was thoughtto have originated from avr thromboembolization. heparin wasresumed for goal ptt 40-60 and coumadin was resumed [8-1]. severalrepeat head ct have all been stable, most recent [2147-8-8].heparin infusion was stopped once a therapeutic inr was reachedon warfarin..#. retroperitoneal bleed:after the patient had a stroke off anticoagulation, heparin wasresumed.  shortly after, the patient developed worsening anemiawith hct eventually falling to 19.  he received a total of 15units prbcs during the hospital course.  his systolic bloodpressure dropped to the 80s and he became tachycardic.  a ctabd/pelvis revealed a large retroperitoneal hematoma.  herequired very aggressive transfusion of rbcs and underwentevacuation of hematoma by vascular surgery on [7-27].  hetolerated the procedure well and hematocrit has been stablesince the procedure.  his heparin was resumed with goal ptt40-60 on [7-30] and was restarted on coumadin [8-1]..the patient was transferred to the neuromedicine step-downservice on [8-1].  he was noted to have intermittant fevers.  ctof the torso and head did not reveal any new source. he becamehypotensive and hct continued to decrease. ekg was concerningfor new t wave inversions and a stat echo showed possibleanterior wall motion abnormality, most likely intracranial twaves.  the patient responded to iv fluids and placement intrendelenberg.  this event was presumed to be due to continuedretroperitoneal bleeding. anticoagulation was again heldtemporarily.the patient was eventually safely anticoagulated and inr was 3.0on day of discharge. the patient's coumadin was being held forsupratherapeutic inr prior to discharge. pt and ptt areelevated, likely due to poor nutritional status. inr will needto be monitored daily and coumadin adjusted appropriately tomaintain goal range 2.5-3.5.  he should have daily inr checksand adjustment of dose to maintain inr 2.5-3.5.  at the time ofdischarge, he was restarted on coumadin 4.0 mg daily.his hematocrit is currently 27.9 and stable.#. respiratory failure: the patient was intubated due to a largetongue hematoma.  on [7-24] (after extubation) he was found tohave increased respiration rate and work of breathing.  he had aclot removed from his trachea by ent with moderate resolution ofsymptoms.  he is currently doing well on room air.#. ventilator-associated pna: the [hospital 228] hospital course wasalso complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis secondaryto pneumonia while intubated. he underwent 2 bronchoscopies withbal and samples grew klebsiella, serratia, and staph aureus.  hecompleted a 12-day course of antibiotics, initially started onvancomycin and cefepime.  he is currently afebrile with noleukocytosis.#. gout: the patient developed erythema, swelling and pain ofthe left 1st mtp joint, consistent with gout. he has a priorhistory of gout, so no joint aspiration was done. the patientresponded well to colchicine with reduced pain and inflammation.#. left knee trauma: the patient fell from bed in micu. x-rayshowed possible small nondisplaced tibial fracture, but unableto see joint line. the patient was weight bearing well with pt.#. htn: the patient was continued on metoprolol and
