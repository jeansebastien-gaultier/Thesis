(2 rpt bps were equal on both arms within 5 mm hg) hr bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2l.  tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide qrs tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia. pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely sob, diaphoretic.  nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld ekg repeated, pt was given 2 mg iv magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather. heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the ccu.  on arrival to ccu, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.  he denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.sdu course:for ventricular ectopy (likely aivr in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to amiodarone.  this was tapered off and he had no further ectopy. echo was performed 7/10:                                  (normal)     (completed only if abn.)mitral valve      norm                           segment   base  mid  apexleft atrium       norm   la    37av. a0. lvot      norm   ao    29                anteriorleft vent.        abn    lvidd 50                ant.sep.tv. ra. vc.       norm   lvids 44                mid.sep.pv. inf. pa.      norm   pwt   10                inf.sep.right vent.       abn    ivs   11                inferiorias. ivs.         norm                           inf.pos.complex chd              ef    28 % ( >50 %)     pos.lat.coronaries                                       lateralpericardium       normmitral valvethere is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  there is trace mitralregurgitation by color and spectral doppler.left atriumthere is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.aortic valve, aorta, lvotthere is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  the aortic valve istricuspid.  there is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectraldoppler.left ventriclethe left ventricular cavity size is normal.  the left ventricular systolicfunction is impaired.  the left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic withregional variation. the inferior wall is akinetic.  the estimated ejectionfraction is 28 %.tricuspid valve -
