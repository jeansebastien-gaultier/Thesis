rehabilitation center and the patient was transferred to the retelk county medical center .past medical history :1) aortic stenosis , severe , echocardiogram in july of 1998 with a peak gradient of 6-8 mm of mercury , aortic valve area calculated to be 0.5 cm squared by the continuity equation .the patient has a history of congestive heart failure .calculated ejection fraction was 45-50% .2)

the gangistown hospital center .she has a son who is actively involved in her care .physical examination :physical examination on admission revealed an elderly woman , sleeping , responsive only to noxious stimuli after having received some sedation in the emergency department .vital signs :heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .head and neck examination was benign .skin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .there were no spider angiomata .neck was supple with no thyromegaly .lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .the heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained pmi which was located in the left mid clavicular line , s1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .it radiates to both carotids bilaterally .there was also a blowing holosystolic murmur heard at the patient 's apex to axilla .there was no s3 appreciated .vascular examination was notable for 1+ carotid impulses which were diminished and delayed and the above mentioned transmitted cardiac murmurs .abdominal examination revealed that the abdomen was soft , non-tender , non-distended , no organomegaly , no masses , normal active bowel sounds .the patient 's extremity examination was notable for erythema of the right calf with a small ulcer with a relatively clean base .neurological examination revealed that the patient was quite sedated at this time having received some medications .she was arousable only to painful stimuli .her pupils were reactive bilaterally .her face was symmetric .she had an intact gag reflex .she was able to move all four of her extremities in response to pain .her deep tendon reflexes were slightly diminished at 1+ bilaterally , but symmetric .laboratory :the patient 's laboratory data on admission is as follows :sodium was 142 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 99 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.1 .ast was 25 , alkaline phosphatase 130 , total bilirubin 3.2 , albumin 3.4 , calcium 8.8 .digoxin level was 0.8 .hematocrit was 33.0 , platelet count 627 , white blood cell count 10,000 , mcv 79.8 .coagulation studies revealed a pt of 17.4 seconds with an inr of 2.1 , ptt 25.5 .the patient 's admission chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate , no congestive heart failure .head ct scan performed in the emergency department revealed no bleed .urinalysis revealed trace microscopic hematuria with 47 red blood cells per high powered field , 1+ bacteria .hospital course :1) mental status changes :on admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .a neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a ct scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .the neurology service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .the patient 's mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , august 16 , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .a neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .the patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck ct scan .at the time of discharge , the patient 's mental status is back to its baseline .2) right lower extremity cellulitis :the patient was evaluated by the surgical service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .the

mitral regurgitation .fortunately , these issues were not active during the present admission .4) status post fall :the patient did fall while inhouse .a head ct scan and cervical spine series were negative .the patient appeared to have no deficits at the time of discharge .5) atrial fibrillation :the patient 's coumadin was continued .6) abnormal liver function tests :on admission , the patient
