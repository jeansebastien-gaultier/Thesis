[known lastname 74316] presented with hypotension, elevatedwbc, elevated lactate, decreased haptoglobin, elevated pt/ptt,and elevated fibrinogen. no clear infectious source, possibleliver or lung. upon presentation pt was treated empirically withmeropenem, levofloxacin from hap with gn coverage since pt hadbeen hospitalized and was on immunosuppression. he ultimatelycompleted a 14 day course of meropenem. culture data wasultimately all negative with the only positive micro test beinga low cmv vl. id started pt on gancyclovir for ppx, and initialacyclovir was stopped. pt then suffered from neutropenia thoughtpossible related to gancyclovir vs atg. repeat cmv vls werenegative and gancyclovir was stopped. histo was negative so alsookay to stop ambisome. pt had been on bactrim as an outpatientfor pcp prophylaxis while on steroids, but this was changed toatovaquone due patients liver injury and concerns for bactriminvolvement. later in hospital course, pt was restarted onacyclovir for prophylaxis while on the steroids. repeat cmv vlfrom [2192-8-22] was positive for 1,630 copies and he was restartedon valganciclovir 900 mg po bid with a plan for 3 weeks oftreatment total after discharge. his cbc will need to bemonitored daily to look for neutropenia, but has remained stableafter 4 days of treatment.# respiratory failure: electively intubated on [7-30] andextubated on [8-3].  post extubation maintained oxygen sats onnasal cannula and then on room air. throughout admission ptcontinued to have cough, occasionally productive, and somewhatcongested chest, but no evidence of infection was found and ptwas not treated with abx for pna after initial presentation. pthas hx of asthma and was previously on advair. so neb tx andadvair were given throughout hospitalization. pt had ct of chestfor f/u of new poorly well-defined round opacities and right midand left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septicemboli or fungal. ct scans shows areas of opacity overallimproving when compared to prior image in [month (only) 116]. as per above, idadded atovaquone for pcp [name9 (pre) ] given that bactrim can cause bmsuppression and liver damage.# atrial fibrillation (afib): pt developed a-fib on [8-1] whichthen resolved on [8-4]. this was likely related infection andrespiratory distress. he was started on metoprolol 25mg [hospital1 ], heconverted to sinus. currently nsr. metoprolol 25mg po bid wascontinued throughout admission although pt did not have any moreincidences of documented afib while on hospital.# elevated lfts: uncertain about etiology initially, but afterliver bx results were final the leading likelyhood ischolestatic drug induced liver injury [3-20] to bactrim. overallimprovement in lft??????s, but t.bili was significantly elevated (38at one point). tbili slowly came down over course of the nextmonth although alt and alk phos remained stably somewhatelevated. the lft improvement that was noted initially dis seemto correlate with atg treatment.# anemia: hemolyzing. schistocytes previously seen on smear.hemophagocytosis seen in bm. pt was intermittently transfused asnoted above when hct would get around 21 or when there wasconcern that pt was getting symptomatic from his anemia. epogenwas given with hd while pt was on dialysis. once dialysis wasdiscontinued, it was given mwf (4k units). as pt clinicallystabilized, he was kept in the hospital by the concern that hecontinued to show evidence of red cell destruction.# thrombocytopenia: pt required plt transfusions in the icu asinitially his plts were low and somewhat labile. he was alsotransfused for liver biopsy. once the patient was stable enoughfor the floor his plts ranged from 20k-80k. on the floor he wastransfused plts once when ir took out the hd cath, but otherwisehis transfusion parameter was set at spontaneous bleeding. theexact etiology of the low plts was never completely clear but itis likely multifactorial and related to hlh, medications, andoverall health.# neutropenia: pt became neutropnic after 4 doses of atg and 2doses of gancyclovir which may have caused bm suppression.counts quickly resolving after stopping offending meds. oncecount improved pt was given last dose of atg. gancyclovir waskept off until [8-24] when a repeat cmv viral load was againsuddenly positive. low dose gancyclovir was restarted and wbccounts should be monitored daily.  pt was then swtiched togalvancyclovir as per id and his wbc have been monitored andhave been stable.  will monitor his wbc while in [hospital 3782] rehab towatch for recurrence of the neutropenia# coagulopathy: related to liver disease, infection, hlh. pt didnot need ffp. pt was given vit k x 3 days early in admission.inr was stable around 1 for most of admission.# renal failure: received cvvhx 3 days. this was stopped on[8-2]. he then had microfiltration on the same day to help withdiureses for extubation.  he was started on hd [8-4]. stayed onhd until [8-18] with slow improvement of kidney function. after hdwas stopped, cr was observed for a few days and when itcontinued to show improvement down below 2, and pt continued tomake very good urine output, his hd line was pulled by ir on[8-23]. renal followed throughout course of disease and helpedmanage electrolytes and guide hd therapy.#hyponatremia: mr. [known lastname 74316] developed hyponatremia on [2192-8-28]when he was autodiuresis after his kidney recovered from hisarf. his hyponatremia and autodiuresis is likely also related topoor glc control. he made up to 6.5l of urine 3 days prior todischarge. please fluid restrict to 2.5l daily as his sodiumimproved with free water fluid restriction.# hypertension: pt had elevated bp that was worse with atginfusion. he initially required nitro drip for better bpcontrol. this was discontinued quickly once control was achievedand he was restarted on his home dose of amlodipine 7.5mg whichwas then increased dose to 10mg qday. hd also helped with bpcontrol. some additional control was provided by the metoprololon which the patient was kept to control afib.#hyperglycemia: pt not a diabetic, but glucose was elevated inthe setting of high dose steroids and tube feeds. managed withnph of varying am and pm doses with humalog iss. once tube feedswere stopped and oral intake restarted he again had to adjustnph and iss to keep sugars in an acceptable range. he is beingdischarged on nph and an iss.# delerium: after patient was transferred to the floor from theicu he developed delirium over the first weekend whichmanifested as inappropriate and sometimes violent actions withpt attempting to hit staff and spitting on staff. pt had to berestrained with leather restraints for parts of two days becausehe was able to break out of the soft restraints despite hisdeconditioning. the first night this occurred pt had to be givenhaloperidol and ativan. psych was then involved in care andrecommended giving quitiapene qhs with extra prn doses asneeded. pt was on this regimen, with slow tapering of the qhsdose for the next two weeks, although delirium never again wasan issue. pt was intermittently mildly depressed about his bodyweakness and how long he had been in the hospital..# lung nodule: new poorly well-defined round opacities and rightmid and left lower lung, concerning for infection such as septicemboli or fungal organisms. chest ct  showed areas of opacityoverall improving when compared to prior image in [month (only) 116] (when hewas previously admitted for what was thought to be ttp). thiswas thought to be related to prior pulmonary hemorrhage that isnow resolving. nodule will need follow-up as an outpatient afterdischarge.# ha: early in admission, pt c/o bilateral frontal ha with nofocal neurological deficits found on exam, however this was anew finding and given low platelet count this was concerning forhead bleed. head ct showed no ic bleeding or other acuteprocess. ha resolved over next few days and was not an issue forthe rest of admission.# chest pain: pt had two episodes of epigastric pain whichraised concerns for chest pain. at each time ekgs wereunremarkable and cardiac enzymes did not show evidence of acutemi (although troponin was stably elevated in context of renalfailure). pt described pain as not unlike the gerd pain heoccasionally had in the past, and both times pain seemed toresolve with a gi cocktail.# insomnia: he had difficulty with sleeping during his hospitalcourse and was started on trazodone qhs with good
