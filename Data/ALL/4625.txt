.2) cxray ( 06-14 ): new bibasilar consolidations are demonstrated accompanied by bilateral small pleural effusion .the lung volumes are slightly increased .there is no pneumothorax identified .3) ct torso ( 06-17 ):1. marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .together with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .2. bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .superimposed infectious consolidation is likely .3. interval development of tree-in-eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .the differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .drug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .4. new jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding , most likely reflecting an infectious etiology .5. overall stability in metastatic burden .4) echo ( 06-18 ): mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function .mild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation .small ( 0.6 cm ) circumferential pericardial effusion , largest around the left atrium .5) l femur xray ( 06-18 ): predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions .no displaced fracture is demonstrated .brief hospital course :mr. mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic rcc on sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .1) bibasilar pneumonia : patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .he was initially placed on ceftriaxone , levaquin , and flagyl in the icu but then changed to azithromycin & ctx at time of transfer to the oncology service .he continued to have an oxygen requirement and ct scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .echo was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .his respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of levaquin .2) metastatic rcc : sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .he underwent a staging ct scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .patient was also found to have abnormal tfts on sutent and was started on replacement therapy .he will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .recent ct scan showed destruction of l femoral neck .he underwent an xray of the l femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .no limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .patient was instructed to restart sutent next monday .3) renal insufficiency : creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .likely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .medications on admission :medications on admission : he takes imodium and lomotil while on sutent for diarrhea .he has not had a bm in 3 days now .he is also on ms contin 45 mg po q12 hours ( confirmed with wife ) and msir 15 mg every 4 hours as needed .medications on
