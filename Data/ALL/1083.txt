on hemodialysis , coronary arterydisease , diabetes , severe peripheral vascular disease status postbilateral knee amputations , who presented with two months ofworsening ascites of unclear etiology. his hospital course byproblem is as follows:1. gastrointestinal: the patient underwent a therapeuticparacentesis with ascites fluid revealing chemistries with totalprotein greater than 2.5 and serum ascites albumin gradientgreater than 1.1 consistent with a transudative ascites , likelydue to volume overload with resultant right heart failure.ascites had 460 white blood cells with 20% polys. therefore , itwas not consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.ascitic fluids were negative for growth of bacteria and cytologyof the ascitic fluids identified no malignant cells. afterconsultation with the cardiology service , it was concluded thatthe ascites was due to massive volume overload , and therefore thepatient should undergo reduction of volume throughultrafiltration at dialysis. this process was begun as aninpatient by the renal service. while the patient was aninpatient , efforts to remove fluid was complicated bydevelopment of hypotension during dialysis aswell as by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular responsewith heart rates up to the 140s. due to the difficulties withremoving fluid at dialysis , the patient was offered the option ofundergoing ultrafiltration by cvvh or an ultrafiltration machine ,but the patient and the family declined to participate in suchcare. it should also be noted that despite our efforts , thepatient was not compliant with fluid restrictions that were putinto place in the patient's diet order , therefore also making itdifficult to treat the patient's volume overload. the patientwas discharged with the plan to continue ultrafiltration at outpatientdialysis in an attempt to continue to remove fluid and reduce thepatient's volume overload. this plan was communicated by theattending renal , dr. simon esbrandt , to the patient's outpatient renalattending , dr. archie chhum .2. renal: as described above , the patient has end-stage renaldisease - on hemodialysis. as described above , ultrafiltrationwas attempted at hemodialysis to remove as much fluid as possibleand to reduce the patient's volume overloaded state.ultrafiltration should be continued as an outpatient to continueto attempt to counteract the patient's volume overload.3. cardiovascular: ischemia , the patient has a history ofcoronary artery disease status post cabg and stent , but his usualaspirin and plavix were initially held given that surgicalrevision of his right below-the-knee amputation had been planned.however , after discussion with the patient's vascular surgeon ,dr. herb piecuch , it was decided that the patient's volumeoverload should be corrected prior to his undergoing surgicalrevision of his right leg. therefore , aspirin and plavix wererestarted on 11/16/2007 .  pump: the patient has evidence ofright heart failure by echocardiogram. on physical exam and asdescribed above , this is likely a consequence of the patient'svolume overload. again , as described above , volume was removedthrough ultrafiltration at dialysis. rhythm: the patient has ahistory of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated , likelyfor fear of noncompliance. the patient was in normal sinusrhythm for the majority of this admission but on 1/8/2007 , thepatient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular withrates to the 120s to 140s. however , the patient refused toaccept monitoring on cardiac telemetry and also refused tocooperate with the administration of intravenous medications forheart rate control. therefore , the patient's dose of orallopressor was slowly titrated upward as tolerated by his bloodpressures , but on discharge his rate remained in the low 100s andwere not optimally controlled. however , the patient refusedfurther management of his atrial fibrillation , and it wastherefore decided that this should be managed as an outpatientwith continued slow readjustment of his oral beta-blockerregimen.4. endocrine: the patient was continued on his home insulinregimen and fingersticks were monitored on a q.a.c. and nightlybasis with adequate control of blood sugars.5. vascular: as described above , the patient has a rightbelow-the-knee amputation , which need surgical revision. asdescribed above , after discussion with the patient's vascularsurgeon , dr. mel bierut , it was decided that the patient'ssurgical revision of his right leg would be addressed after hisissues with volume overload are resolved.6. infectious disease: it was noted that the patient has as alikely paronychia of his left index finger. plain films wereobtained , which did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. ahand surgery consult was obtained , and it was noted that therewere no vascular issues with his left hand and that no urgentsurgical debridement of the left finger was necessary. thepatient was treated with oral levofloxacin and will continuetaking levofloxacin for a total of 3-week course to end on6/11/2007 .  oxycodone was administered for pain control of hisleft finger as well as for pain control of his right leg.prophylaxis , the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin fordvt prophylaxis and placed on nexium for gi prophylaxis.the patient was full code during this admission.physician followup plans: the patient has a followup appointmentwith his vascular surgeon , dr. huey lamond , on 10/26/2007 at2:30 p.m. , phone number 178-843-9703. the patient should callhis doctor his primary care physician , dr. jamal gehlert ,telephone #204-180-5657 , for appointment in two to three weeks.the patient will continue dialysis at gentville under thedirection of dr. alphonso berwald on a monday , wednesday , fridayschedule. this patient should complete a total of 14-day courseof levofloxacin to end on 6/11/2007 for his left fourth fingerparonychia/skin infection. the patient's beta-blocker should betitrated upwards as tolerated by blood pressure for bettercontrol of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. as describedabove , ultrafiltration should be used during dialysis to removetotal body volume.medications on discharge:1. aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily.2. phoslo 1334 mg by mouth q.a.c.3. plavix 75 mg by mouth daily.4. folate 2 mg by mouth daily.5. insulin nph 14 units subcutaneous b.i.d.6. levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth q.48h. until 6/11/2007 .7. toprol 50 mg by mouth daily.8. nephrocaps one tablet p.o. daily.9. oxycodone 5 mg by mouth q.4h. p.r.n. pain.10. lyrica 100 mg by p.o. twice daily.11. zocor 20 mg by mouth nightly12. zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth daily.escription document: 1-8793311 hffocusdictated by: bursik , michaelattending: christianson , colbydictation id 6218454d: 8/20/07t: 8/20/07
