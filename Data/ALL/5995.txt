[known lastname 17385] is a 38 y.o. male with a history of psoriaticarthritis on immunosuppresive therapy, htn, hl, dm, cervicogenicheadaches who was recently discharged on [1-8] for left leg pain.pt reprots that he presented to the ed on [2202-1-3] for l heel painradiating to knees. he was initially treated with vanc and ciprofor question of septic left knee; the aspirate showed [numeric identifier ] wbcand 94% pmn but neg gram stain and culture and no crystals soabx discontinued. leni was negative for dvt or [hospital ward name ] cyst. nofx on x-ray. this was thought to be a psoriatic arthritis flare,so his prednisone was increased from his home dose of 30mg to60mg daily with improvement in his inflammation. his painsubsequently reutrned and repeat leni was negative. pt wasstarted on gabapentin for presumed fibromyalgia and dischargedyesterday on a stable pain regimen of ms contin with prndilaudid. he saw rheum today who referred him to derm forevaluation of a superficial erythematous plaque, questionederythema nodosum. derm did not think this was consistent but wasconcerned about compartment syndrome so referred pt to ed..in the er, vitals were: t 98.2, p 79, bp 145/77, rr 17, o2sat98. leni neg for dvt but pt was noted to have an extensive leftposterior calf subcutaneous complex fluid collection. ortho didnot see evidence of compartment syndrome and recommendedvascular c/s to rule out necrotizing fasciitis given the fluidcollection. vascular did not think this was consistent withnecrotizing fasciitis. an mri of the le was done per rads recs,and this showed small fluid collections concerning for abscessin his gastrocnemius that were too small to be drained with noevidence of osteomyelitis. he was given vancomycin, zosyn, andclindaycin. he also received his home meds of gabapentin, mscontin, and po dilaudid. he was admitted to medicine with vs ontransfer: t 98.5, p 76, bp 136/68, rr 15, o2sat 98ra..on evaluation on the floor, patient complains of persistent lepain and tenderness which is controlled on his pain regimen. hislle knee effusion has improved markedly since his recentadmission. he denies any fevers, chills, or night

noted to have acutely elevatedcreatinine after i&d by surgery.  all urine lytes testingindicated pre-renal etiology. resolved after fluid challenge. heagain had acute renal failure on [2202-1-27] in the setting of havingreceived increased doses of pain medications and resultanthypoperfusion. his peak creatinine was 3.0, and resolved to hisbaseline of 0.8-0.9 by the time of discharge..# left calf fluid collection with overlying cellulitis: no dvtor [hospital ward name 4675] cyst on multiple imaging studies.  no compartmentsyndrome per orthopedic evaluation.  no osteomyelitis on mri andnot consistent with necrotizing fascitis per vascular surgery.it was noted on imaging that he had gastroceminis fluidcollection and overlying cellulitis.  no signs of septic jointfrom evaluation of knee aspiration.  he had one positive bloodculture with pan-sensitive staph.  he was placed on zosyn, laternarrowed to nafcillin.  all other microbiology data werenegative.  ir and vascular surgery helped drained the fluidcollection.  leg incision is to heal via secondary intention.he developed a body rash that was determined to be folliculitis. he completed the 2 week course iv antibiotics in house.  hismajor issue remained to be pain management.  he required a largeamount of narcotics to control his pain, but after overdose (seebelow) he was switched to a very conservative regimen.  it wasdetermined that the swelling/fluid collection is from psoriaticarthritis versus idiopathic spondylarthropathy. he wasdischarged in stable condition. muscle biospy showed necroticmuscle with granulation tissue..# medication overdose: on [2202-1-26], on recommendation from thepain service, patient's ms contin dose was increased to 160 mgtid from 130 mg tid, in addition to being ordered for prndilaudid. later that night, pt fell while ambulating. he had act scan which was negative for acute intracranial pathologu.morning after the fall, pt was noted to be somnolent andhypotensive. he was given naloxone 0.4 mg x3 and would arousebriefly after each dose. he continued to be hypotensive after abolus of 1l of ns. he was transferred to the micu for furthermonitoring. in the micu he was monitored closely and hishypotension and mental status gradually improved. he was calledout back to the floor on [2202-1-28]. he never required intubation.after being called out, he was normotensive and alert andoriented x 3. it was believed his hypotension and altered mentalstatus were caused by medication overdose in the setting ofacute kidney injury.  he was discharged on oxycodone 5mg q4hours, which he did well on for the 3 days prior to hisdischarge. he will follow up with the pain clinic as anoutpatient..# psoriatic arthritis: on golimumab every month, azathioprine,prednisone. rheumatology was consulted and suggested to decreaseprednison level to 20mg from 30 mg.  he continued on pcp [name9 (pre) ]with bactrim.  indomethacin was held due to renal failure butrestarted on
