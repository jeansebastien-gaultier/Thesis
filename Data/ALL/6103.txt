illness:45f with esld secondary to etoh, aiha due to lasix recently onprednisone who was initially presented to osh with hepaticencephalopathy transferred from osh on [5-27] for liver transplantevaluation whose course has been complicated by coagulopathywith recurrent epistaxis, vre bacteremia, new onset afib withrvr and now with worsening leukocytosis and diffuse bilatpulmonary infiltrates..to summarize her recent course, the patient was admitted to oshfrom [date range (1) 74368] for hemolytic anemia thought to be [1-15] lasix andwas started on prednisone 50mg. on [5-22], she represented withhepatic encephalopathy and t [age over 90 ]f where she underwentparacentesis with negative cultures. cxr showed b/l infiltratesand she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she wastransferred to [hospital1 18] for liver transplant eval..at [hospital1 18], she was noted to have numerous small pulmonary noduleson [5-29] chest ct of unclear significance. pulm consulted for?bronch given concern for infection vs. malignancy. due toworsening confusion the patient underwent repeat paracentesiswith 135 wbc. eventually blood cultures from [6-11] returned [12-17]bottles +ve for vre and was started on daptomycin. likely sourcewas colonization of urine discovered on [5-30]. also on [6-11], thepatient was started on ctx for positive u/a which was thencontinued per id to empirically cover possible sbp. also treatedfor hepatorenal syndrome (cre 1.5 which improved to 0.4) withalbumin, midodrine, and octreotide x 4 days, which was d/c'd on[6-16] given improvement in renal function..on [6-14], the patient developed significant epistaxis requiringmultiple ffp, platelet, and rbc transfusions. there was concernfor aspiration given altered mental status. despite continued g+black stools her hct has been stable since [6-15]. on [6-16], themedical team repeated her ct chest to eval for progression ofpulmonary nodules and found bilateral infiltrates concerning forinfection, bleeding, or aspiration. she was started on bactrimfor possible pcp given her recent prolonged predinsone coursethat had been discontinued on [6-15]. also on [6-16] developednew-onset afib with rvr 150s that responded to diltiazem. due toincreased volume of diarrhea and climbing wbc count she wasstarted on empiric flagyl on [2106-6-17]..on transfer to the micu, the patient denies

nj feeding tube (8 fr) was placed to 120 cm.otherwise normal egd to second part of duodenum.brief hospital course:45 yo female with esld [1-15] etoh cirrhosis s/p tips who presentedfrom osh for liver transplant evaluation, recent severebleeding, who developed sepsis, dic, and multiorgan failure. abrief hospital course by problem is outlined below:.#sepsis/dic: the patient required multiple vasopressors tomaintain svo2 >70 and map>60s. lactate continued to rise and shebecame progressively acidotic. end organ hypoperfusion wasdemonstrated by anuria. she was treated broadly with antibioticsand aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin forintravascular volume support and to correct her underlyingcoagulopathy. hco3 was utilized prn given worsening acidosis.the patient was made cmo after an extensive family discussionregarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired afterremoval of vasopressors and respiratory support..# respiratory failure: progressively worsening bilateral lunginfiltrates resulting in hypoxia requiring intubation.differential included dah given coagulopathy, infection (e.g.pcp/fungal given recent course of steroids), or trali (thoughunlikely). she was afebrile with rapidly progressiveleukocytosis. the patient was treated with steroids and bactrimfor pcp, [name10 (nameis) 74369] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to covermycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage. given worseninginfiltrates and p/f ratio suggestive of ards, she was ventilatedon ardsnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowedpermissive hypercapnea..# acute renal failure: cr progressively worsened in the settingof sepsis and the patient became anuric. differential includedhrs, atn [1-15] renal hypoperfusion, prerenal [1-15] hypoalbuminemiaand 3rd spacing. she was unable to take po octreotide, midodrinedue to increased gi secretions and poor absorption. attempted toincreased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products.pressors were utilized to maintain renal perfusion. the patientdeveloped a severe lactic acid metabolic acidosis due to tissuehypoxia requiring hco3 pushes..# etoh cirrhosis: decompensated liver disease s/p tips, withhepatic encephalopathy, coagluapathy, elevated tbili,hyponatremia. on admission, aldactone held given hyponatremiaand hypotension. lasix held given auto-immune hemolytic anemia.she was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepaticencephalopathy. ultrasound perfomed on admission and showedpatent tips, cirrhotic liver, no hepatoma. diagnosticparacentesis was performed, and was negative for sbp..during hospitalization, she was evaluated for liver transplant,and was transiently placed on the transplant list but wasremoved after becoming septic. tte showed a hyperdynamic ef,with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease.liver ct completed. pft's performed, with noted mild diffusionabnormality. chest ct demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below)which were stable on repeat ct chest one week later.  chest ctfrom [2106-6-16] showed marked worsening (see below)..hospitalization was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome.  hrs improved aftermidodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia nearbaseline of 127-129.  she was fluid restricted, but continued tohave worsening peripheral edema; diuretics were held given herrecently diagnosed aiha [1-15] lasix..# arrhythmia: the patient had two asymptomatic episodes ofstable vtach on the floor. on [2106-6-16], pt developed atrialfibrillation to 160's.  she was converted with lopressor anddiltiazam, but then reverted to afib/flutter rate-controlled ondiltiazem.  on transfer to the micu, she had bursts of atrialflutter with variable block and rate-dependent bundle branchblock.  she remained asymptomatic but nodal agents were heldgiven hypotension..# leukocytosis: initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outsidehospital treated with a course of iv antibiotics. upon admissionto [hospital1 18], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood,urine and stool cultures. although pulmonary nodules were seenon chest ct, this was not felt to represent an acute infectiousprocess given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection,therefore no further antibiotics were given.  acute alcoholichepatitis was considered as a possible cause of leukocytosis,however there was no recent alcohol use to go along with thisdiagnosis..on [6-5], ucx with vre.  on [6-11], pt's blood cultures positivefor vre.  felt that picc line was possible source; however,wound tip culture showed no growth.  she was started ondaptomycin and ceftriaxone per id.  echocardiogram was negativefor vegetation.  on [6-16], a repeat chest ct was performed forfurther characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed theinterval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to beconsistent with pcp, [name10 (nameis) 7470] given that she was weaned offsteroids for aiha only days earlier. she was started empericallyon treatment doses of bactrim however she continued to worsen.diagnostic bronchoscopy was considered upon transfer to the icuhowever the patient was too unstable for the procedure. flagylalso emperically started for c. diff..# coagulopathy: [1-15] liver disease. pt has had multiple red bloodcell transfusions, ffp, cryo, and platelets during admission.also received ddavp for uremic platelets.  she had an episode ofprofuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from doboff feedingtube that could only be controlled with packing, afrin andpressure by ent.  she also bled from her paracentesis site,requiring transfusion and sutures. she developed dic and diffusemucosal bleeding after becoming septic..# auto-immune hemolytic anemia: diagnosed with auto-immunehemolytic anemia at outside hospital, felt to be secondary tolasix. re-consulted hematology here who agreed with thisdiagnosis. lasix was held during admission and repeat coombsantibody negative. reticulocyte count high on admission (29%),with elevated ldh, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestiveof ongoing hemolysis. however, hemolysis indices improved onprednisone, and slow prednisone taper initiated as indicesstabilized. blood counts supported as needed with bloodtransfusions (for hgb <7 given difficult crossmatch (she has twoantibodies)..# gi: egd performed on this admission demonstrated grade 1esophageal varices, a trans-endoscopic nj feeding tube, andotherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum..medications on
