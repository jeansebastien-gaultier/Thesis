[last name (stitle) ] in 2 weeks to discuss renal mra andpossible vascular intervention because it was not possible toaccurately assess the patient's renal arteries with ultrasound. hypertension: the patient had difficult to controlhypertension as documented above.  the patient was discharged onmaximal doses of blood pressure medications with the exceptionof starting an ace-inhibitor or [last name (un) ] in light of his poor renalfunction secondary to renal artery stenosis.  the patient'sunderlying etiology of hypertension is unclear but likelyrelated to renal artery stenosis.  this issue will be addressedas an outpatient with dr. [last name (stitle) ] and dr. [first name (stitle) 14966], the patient'scardiologists. pump: the patient had a cardiac echo which demonstrated an efof 60-65% and a moderately dilated atrium.  cardiaccatheterization revealed severely elevated left and right sidedfilling pressures which were indicative of the congestive heartfailure described above. rhythm: the patient had no episodes of arrythmias. gi bleed/anemia: the patient reportedly had a hct drop from 35to 27.5 at the osh.  there was no evidence of gi bleeding atthis hospital.  further analysis of the patient's hct over thelast few years reveals a chronic anemia.  the patient wastransfused a total of 4 units while in the unit and just priorto discharge.  in the long term, it may be considered to sendthe patient for colonoscopy or endoscopy to evaluate for gipathology that could account for chronic slow bleeding.  withrespect to etiology of the patient's chronic anemia, ironstudies are pending at the time of this discharge summary. acute on chronic renal insufficiency: after his cardiaccatherization the patient's creatinine rose to a peak of 3.8from his admission creatinine 1.8.  with aggressive diuresis,the patient's dye nephropathy resolved and creatinine returnedto his baseline of 1.6 prior to discharge.  the patient did notrequire hemodialysis. code: dnr/dni.  this status was confirmed with the patient,his son, and his daughter.medications on admission:aspirin 325 mg dailylopressor 75 mg twice dailyhydralazine 25 mg twice dailynorvasc 10 mg twice dailyhctz 12.5 mg dailylisinopril 40 mg dailyironcrestor 10 mg dailyfolic aciddischarge medications:1. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. aspirin 325 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1)tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po daily (daily).disp:30 tablet, delayed release (e.c.)(s) refills:23. pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig:one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12 hours).4. amlodipine besylate 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po bid (2times a day).disp:120 tablet(s) refills:25. rosuvastatin calcium 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet podaily (daily).disp:30 tablet(s) refills:26. labetalol hcl 200 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po bid (2times a day).disp:120 tablet(s) refills:27. isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po tid(3 times a day).disp:180 tablet(s) refills:28. hydralazine hcl 50 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po tid (3times a day).disp:180 tablet(s) refills:29. supplemental oxygensupplemental oxygen. rate 2l continuous.  room air oxygensaturation 86%. for portability, provide pulse dose system10. lasix 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:211. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule poonce a day.disp:30 capsule(s) refills:212. iron 50 mg tablet sustained release sig: one (1) tabletsustained release po once a day.disp:30 tablet sustained release(s) refills:2discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure,acute on chronic renal failure, anemiadischarge condition:stabledischarge instructions:1. please take all of your medications.2. please seek medical attention should you experience any ofthe following: shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,sudden weakness, lightheadedness, dizziness, loss ofconsciousness, fainting, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills3. please see your pcp and cardiologist (dr.
