admission date:  [2130-2-20]     discharge date:  [2130-2-27]date of birth:   [2077-9-15]     sex:  mservice:  trans [doctor first name 147]history of present illness:  this is a 52 year old gentlemanwith end-stage renal disease secondary to poly-cystic kidneydisease.  he has been on hemodialysis for the past five yearsvia a left av graft.  he presents now for a cadaveric renaltransplant.past medical history:1.  hypertension.2.  gastroesophageal reflux disease.medications on admission:1.  atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day.2.  zestril 5 mg p.o. q. day.3.  prilosec 20 mg p.o. twice a day.4.  celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.5.  rocaltrol one tablet p.o. q. day.6.  renagel 3200 mg p.o. three times a day.allergies:   no known drug allergies.brief hospital course:  the patient was admitted to thetransplant surgery service on [2130-2-20], and underwentan uncomplicated cadaveric renal transplant. the patienttolerated the procedure well and had a postoperative coursethat was significant for delayed graft function.  hishospital course is summarized as follows by systems:1.  neurologic:  the patient had adequate pain control on amorphine pca postoperatively.  when the patient wastolerating p.o. intake on postoperative day three, thepatient's pca was discontinued and he was started on percocetfor pain control with good effect.2.  respiratory:  the patient was requiring an oxygensupplementation for the initial five days postoperativelywith oxygen saturations ranging from 93 to 95% on two liters.once the patient began ambulating and using his incentivespirometer, he no longer needed supplemental oxygen,saturating 95% on room air.3.  cardiovascular:  immediately postoperatively, thepatient's atenolol was held.  back on postoperative day one,the patient was noted to have a decrease in his systolicblood pressure to around 90, coincident with a decrease inhis urine output.  the patient was given fluid boluses buthis pressure continued to decline, reaching a nadir of 74systolic.  the decision was made to transfer the patient tothe sicu for closer monitoring of his volume status using hiscbp.  once in the unit, the patient's systolic pressureincreased to the low 100's.  he was started on a renal dosedopamine drip.  it was believed that his episode ofhypotension coincident with some shaking chills, wassecondary to a gamma globulin reaction.  his gamma globulinwas subsequently discontinued and he remained in the sicuuntil postoperative day four.at that time, the patient's systolic pressures were back upinto the 140s to 150s and he was making good urine.  he wassubsequently discharged to the floor where his pressuresremained in the normal range throughout the remainder of hishospital stay.  he had no complaints of chest pain orshortness of breath throughout the hospital stay.4.  gastrointestinal:  the patient was tolerating a limitedp.o. intake by postoperative day two, but continued toincrease his p.o. intake to the point of tolerating a regularrenal diet by the day of discharge.  he was on a bowelregimen of colace and dulcolax suppositories p.r.n.  he had abowel movement on postoperative day three.5.  genitourinary:  the patient's creatinine preoperativelywas 12.7, and in the pacu had dropped to 11.5 with apotassium of 5.5.  however, coincident with his episode ofhypotension on the morning of postoperative day one, hispotassium had risen to 7.2 and his creatinine had jumped upto 12.6.  once in the sicu, the renal team decided to dialyzethe patient.  he underwent one treatment of hemodialysis.his creatinine dropped to 8.7 with a potassium of 5.6.  overthe next couple of days, his creatinine rose to level off ata level of approximately 10.0.  there it remained for theremainder of his hospital stay.  while he was in theintensive care unit he was receiving 80 mg of intravenouslasix twice daily to maintain his urine output.after transferring to the floor and maintaining an output ofapproximately 250 cc an hour, his intravenous fluids werediscontinued on postoperative day five.  on postoperative daysix, his intravenous lasix was discontinued and the patientcontinued to have an adequate urine output.  at the time ofdischarge, he still remained approximately 12 liters positivefrom his preoperative dry weight.  it was noted that thepatient had some unilateral swelling of his right armconcerning for a thrombosis secondary to the right ij centralvenous line.  on the [2-24], a right upper extremityultrasound was performed that demonstrated widely patentvenous outflow with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.it was felt that the unilateral swelling was secondary to thepatient's positive fluid status combined with poor venousoutflow secondary to his right av fistula.6.  infectious disease:  the patient had no infectiouscomplications throughout the course of his hospital stay.7.  immunosuppression:  the patient was initially started onthymoglobulin, cellcept, solu-medrol, postoperatively.  afterit was believed that the patient was having a reaction tothymoglobulin, he received a dose of 100 mg of zenapax on[2-22].  the thymoglobulin was discontinued and he wasloaded on rapamune.  the patient received a second dose ofzenapax four days after the first dose.  rapamune levels weresent after the third dose and are pending at the time of thisdictation.  the patient's white count has levelled off ataround 5 to 6,000.8.  tubes, lines and drains:  the patient had a rightinternal jugular line which was discontinued on postoperativeday five.  the patient's foley catheter was removed onpostoperative day five and had absolutely no trouble voiding.his [location (un) 1661]-[location (un) 1662] drain continued to put out greater than 30cc over a 24 hour period, and therefore, the patient will bedischarged home with the [location (un) 1661]-[location (un) 1662] in place.disposition:   the patient is expected to be discharged on[2130-2-27].discharge diagnoses:1.  end-stage renal disease secondary to poly-cystic kidneydisease, status post cadaveric renal transplant.discharge medications:1.  atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day.2.
