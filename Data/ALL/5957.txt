[known lastname 84119] is an 85 year-old woman with resp failure/ventdependent s/p trach, recent pes, schf (ef 25%), af, and pvd whois transferred from rehab because of unresponsiveness and lowtidal volumes and is admitted to micu for further management..she was discharged on [2169-1-13] from the thoracics service afterpresenting from an osh with tracheal laceration in the settingof traumatic intubation and sub-cutaneous emphysemapost-intubation.  her recent history prior to that includes afall on [10-31] with a c2 odontoid fracture and diagnosis of pesin the setting of dyspnea on [2168-12-10] requiring intubation(complicated by trach injury) for hypercapnea.  on the thoracicsservice, she [date range 1834] multiple bronchoscopies and trachplacement ((#7 [last name (un) 295]) and revisions with clot demonstrated inposterior trachea and trach dislodgement.  she was discharged ontrach cpap with cmv onvernight.  she was transitioned from cmvventilation to cpap, and was able to tolerate trach collar forunspecified periods of time..at rehab, she had ams/unresponsiveness which is different fromher baseline, and low tidal volumes on pressure support and wastransferred to the

wasadmitted due to altered mental status and low tidal volumes.the patient with known traumatic intubation at osh c/b trachealinjury, and trached here requiring multiple revisions.  alsowith copd. patient went into respiratory distress with hypoxiaand hypotension.  she was started on levophed and [month/year (2) 1834]emergent bronch.  the bronch showed granulation tissueobstructing 95% of her tube.  the tube was passed farther downpast the site of obstruction and the patient's respiratorystatus improved and was weaned off levophed.  the patient then[month/year (2) 1834] repeat bronch the following day on [1-15] that showedthe tube to be patent and the tracheal laceration to be healingwell.  the patient's respiratory status remained stable and herventilator settings at the time of dicharge were: cmv, vt(set):450, rr (set): 14, peep: 5 cmh2o, and fio2: 40%.  thepatient was also treated for a vap based on cxr (leftretrocardiac opcaity and increasing sputum).  she was started onvanco/cefepime on [1-16] for presumed vap.  she was then changedto vanco/meropenem given her esbl urine cx results.  her sputumsubsequently grew out gnr and she will continue vancomycin andmeropenem for a planned 8 day course (last day:[1-24]).  a piccline was placed on [1-18].  the patient did have a low grade tempof 100.5 at the time of discharge.  this was discussed with dr.[last name (stitle) 84121] at [hospital1 ] and is aware.#. vap: see above for respiratory course.  patient with planned8 day course of meropenem with final day being [2169-1-24].  sputumis currently growing gnr and needs to be followed up for finalspeciation and sensitivities.#uti: the patient was intially treated with ciprofloxacin onadmission for a positive ua.  she was then broadened tovanco/cefepime given she was at rehab for resistant organisms.the ucx returned esbl e. coli and was switched to meropenem fora planned 8 day course (last day [2169-1-24]).# altered mental status:  the patient came in minimally reactivewhich was a change from her baseline per the family.  her changein mental status was attributed to her infection and aftertreatment for her vap and uti her mental status returned tobaseline.  she is able to follow very simple commands and answersome simple yes/no questions.# chf:  the patient had an ef 25% per report.  her metoprololand lisinopril was held given her infection and normal bloodpressure. additionally, her lasix was initially held.  thepatient was restarted on her metoprolol at 12.5mg [hospital1 ], butseveral doses were held secondary to hypotension andbradycardia.  her blood pressure and heart rate should bemonitored at rehab and titrate metoprolol accordingly.  thepatient was restarted on her lasix 20mg po bid given her volumeoverload. her weight, respirtory status and i/o should bemonitored and lasix titrated at rehab.#anemia: the patient admission hct was 26 and slowly trendeddown to hct 21.  her hemolysis labs were negative and there wereno signs of active bleeding.  her guaiac was negative.  she wastrnasfused one unit [1-18] and her hct remained stable.  upondischarge her hct was 25.7.# pes:  patient with recent diagnosis in [11-30].  the patient wascontinued on coumadin 3mg daily and brdiged with lovenox 60mgq12 for a subtherapeutic inr.  upon discharge her coumadin wasincreased to 5mg daily and continued on lovenox 60mg [hospital1 ] untilinr

afib:  patient's metoprolol was initially held due to ongoinginfection.  her metoprolol was restarted on 12.5mg [hospital1 ] andcontinued on systemic coagulation.medications on admission:1.
