internal mammary lymphadenopathy .the poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal ct scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .there was no obvious gior pancreatic tumor identified .the patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .a specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .the patient was transferred to nimaconwood valley hospital for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .she has had no motor weakness , abnormal sensation , numbness , tingling or incontinence of bowel or bladder .she denied fevers , chills or sweats .there has been no gi or gu symptoms except for constipation .past medical history :unremarkable .medications :on admission included percocet for pain and multivitamins .allergies :no known drug allergies .family history :the patient 's father died at age 69 with metastatic prostate cancer .the patient 's sister has a history of cervical cancer .social history :the patient is married and lives with her husband .she has no children .she is a nonsmoker .she drinks socially .she has not had any alcoholic beverages during this pregnancy .physical examination :on admission revealed a pleasant , comfortable , tired appearing female .the patient was afebrile .blood pressure was 98/64 .pulse 82 .respiratory rate 20 .skin exam revealed a right posterior parietal scalp nodle measuring 2 x 3 cm which was very firm .there was a 1 cm firm nodule at the left upper thoracic region of the back between the midline and the scapula .there was a 1 cm firm nodule in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen .heent exam was unremarkable .neck was supple .there was no jugular venous distention .there was no lymphadenopathy .back was without cva tenderness .there was no scapular tenderness .there was mild lower thoracic tenderness .lungs were clear to auscultation .there were no rales or wheezes .there was no egophony .cardiac exam was tachycardic and regular , normal s1 and s2 .there was a ii / vi systolic ejection murmur loudest at the left upper sternal border .there was no heave .abdomen was gravid .bowel sounds were present .the abdomen was tympanitic and nontender .the liver was 11 cm by percussion .there was no liver edge palpable , no spleen tip palpable .rectal revealed normal muscle tone , heme negative stool .extremities revealed 1+ bipedal edema on admission .neurological examination revealed the patient to be alert and oriented times three .cranial nerves ii - xii were intact .motor was 5/5 .sensation was intact to light touch .deep tendon reflexes were 1-2+ and symmetric bilaterally .toes were downgoing .laboratory data :on admission included an alt of 108 , ast of 286 .total bilirubin 3.0 , direct bilirubin of 2.0 .alkaline phosphatase 1148 .ldh 806 .calcium 11.8 .albumin 2.3 .hematocrit was 30.6 .white blood cell count was 11.14 .pt was 13.2 .ptt was 29.8 .hospital course :the patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on 1/13/91 .the work-up for the extent of the patient 's disease included mri scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a t3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .an epidural mass was present at t10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .an abdominal and pelvic ct scan with iv contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic ivc and distention of the azygous system suggestive of ivc obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .a bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .ahead ct scan revealed a metastatic lesion in the right vertex of the calvarium but no intracranial abnormalities .work-up for the source of the primary tumor which is still unknown included a mammogram which identified no suspicious microcalcifications and no dominant masses .the abdominal and pelvic ct scans showed no suspicious gi masses , no pancreatic mass ; a 2 cm ovarian cyst .the review of the pathology from bri health confirmed a high grade adenocarcinoma .erica and basic cystic protein stains are still pending .serum markers were normal .the cea was less than 0.7 .the hcg on admission was 30,710 and on 1/19 was 805 .the ca-125 was still pending and alphafeto protein is still pending .hypercalcemia :the patient presented with a serum calcium of 11.8 and an albumin of 2.3 on admission .she received three days of intravenous etidronate with normal saline diuresis and the serum calcium subsequently decreased to 9.0 .the patient was then switched to po etidronate .ivc obstruction :the patient has extensive hepatic metastases and by ct scan there is obstruction of the intrahepatic ivc .this has resulted in marked bilateral lower extremity and presacral edema with ascites .the patient 's low serum albumin is also contributing to her extensive edema .hypoxia and shortness of breath :although the patient 's room air saturation was 96% during this admission , she subjectively complained of increased shortness of breath .it was felt that the patient 's extensive pulmonary metastases and bilateral pleural effusions resulted in increased work of respiration and a sensation of shortness of breath .impending spinal cord compression :the patient had back pain on admission without any focal neurological signs .the mri scan on admission revealed an impending cord compression at the level of t10 .she was started on decadron and on 1/17 began the first of ten radiation treatments to two fields ( t2 to t5 and t9 to t11 ) .per the patient 's wishes , dr. dalywoo droreite the windgo hospital was consulted for a second opinion regarding the management of her malignancy .dr. linke recommended chemotherapy with pfl .per the patient 's wishes , she was transferred to the windgo hospital for chemotherapy .alt was 53 .ast was 89 .her ldh was 394 .her alkaline phosphatase was 1514 .total bilirubin was 2.1 .direct bilirubin was 1.4 .albumin was 2.3 .calcium 9.1 .hematocrit was 32.5 .white blood cell count was 16.89 .pt was 12.9 .ptt was 27.3 .disposition :medications :on discharge included etidronate , 475 mg iv q day ;
