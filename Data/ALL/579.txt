anicteric sclera with pupils 2 mm and reactive .the oropharynx was not well appreciated secondary to et tube .neck :no lymphadenopathy , thyromegaly , or jvd .heart :regular rate and rhythm with a ii / vi systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border without radiation .lungs :scattered rhonchi with expiratory wheezes .abdomen :normoactive bowel sounds , nondistended .the liver span was 10 cm .no splenomegaly or abdominal masses .lymph nodes :no cervical , axillary , supraclavicular , or inguinal lymphadenopathy .extremities :no clubbing , cyanosis , or edema .neurological :unresponsive with a trace to 1+ dtr 's bilaterally and downgoing toes .laboratory examination :at the time of admission , sodium 139 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26 , bun 17 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 114 , ldh 453 , total bilirubin 0.4 , total protein 7.4 .the white count was 4.5 with a differential of 70 polys , 6 bands , 18 lymphs , 6 monocytes .hematocrit 36.5 , platelet count 287,000 , mcv 101 .pt 12.6 .urinalysis :specific gravity 1.025 , ph 5.0 , 1+ protein , trace blood and bacteria .an lp performed on 12/6/91 revealed a glucose of 73 and protein of 16 .cultures were negative at the time of this dictation .ekg was unremarkable .the chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates .laboratories at the time of transfer to the micu :bun 17 , creatinine 1.7 , ldh 749 , total protein 6.0 , albumin 2.6 , white count 5.1 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 278,000 .pt 12.5 , ptt 26.0 .hospital course :micu course-the patient was continued on bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his pcp pneumonia .the patient was switched from p.o. prednisone to iv solu-medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .the patient 's respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .the patient 's anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin b-12 .the patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .the patient was started on a morphine drip for control .the patient 's peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ards picture .the patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his pip from 60 to 45 .on 12/10/91 , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .the patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to iv pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by bactrim .consultation with dr. test led to a plan to begin aerosolized pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via iv .however , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .the patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .the patient was started on timentin 3.1 grams iv q4 hours for presumed sepsis .despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of dopamine and levophed drips .the patient 's condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .the patient 's oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .the patient 's electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .on the morning of 12/11/91 , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of neo-synephrine .at this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a ph of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .the patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 a.m.medications at the time of death :pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , pentamidine 300 mg iv q.d. , solu-medrol 20 mg iv t.i.d. , timentin 3.1 grams iv q4 , morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour iv , dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min iv drip , pavulon 2 mg iv q1hour , levophef 16 mcg / min iv drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per ng tube t.i.d. , folate 1 mg per ng tube q.d. , vitamin b-12 , colace , vitamin k , senna .disposition :the wife was approached for permission for autopsy which she agreed to .            vf679/2975            ma q. meed , m.d. ej5d :            12/11/91batch :            2575report :            a6042x8t :            12/12/91dicatated by :            shaline zukbolmgrine , medical interncc :1. dalli a. pop , m.d
