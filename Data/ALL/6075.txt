theventilator. throughout his hospital course, he had dailywake-ups through the sedation and pain medication. early in hiscourse, he awoke very agitated and not following commands,though was alert, looking around the room and moving allextremities with equal and reactive pupils. he had a history ofalcohol use, and had experienced dt's in the past withwithdrawal. consequently, he was maintained on a versed drip andmuch of the confusion was attributed to possible withdrawal inaddition to delerium. with re-evaluation by wake-ups, thepatient slowly became more attentive and did not havetremors/shakes, was following commands and communicated that hewas not in any discomfort. after extubation, a full neuro examwas normal including strength/sensation, cranial nerves, dtrs,cerebellar exam and speech/memory.heent: the patient was noted to have poor dentition, but nosigns of abscess/infection on oral exam. in addition, a ct scanof his head was normal and showed no signs of sinusitis.pulmonary: his active problems during this admission wererespiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusion. the mainconcern for this patient was that of pneumonia, and streppneumonia grew in the first sputum culture on admission. he wasnoted to have a large r pleural effusion, which was tapped, butdid not show evidence of empyema. he remained on the ventilatorfor 17 days. upon extubation, he did well, had minimalsecretions and strong cough, o2 sats in the 90's, work ofbreathing was easy.cardiac: active issues during this admission includedhypotension and atrial fibrillation, with a history of cad andchf.  the hypotension was not fluid responsive and he requiredlevophed pressor support for the first 15 days ofhospitalization. this was weened off and he was eventuallyrestarted on all of his home htn medication. the hypotension wasfelt to be sepsis physiology, without evidence of new mycardialinjury. the atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled, and atfirst anticoagulation was held [3-9] a supratherapeutic inr. thiscame down to normal levels, and a heparin drip was started andhe is being bridged back onto coumadin. in terms of his chf, anecho revealed only mildly depressed lvef at 40-50%, andspecifics are listed in the report above.gi/fen: patient was aggressively volume resuscitated early on,being at the highest 27 liters positive on his i/o's. thiseventually was diuresed to a slightly positive volume status,and he will go to rehab with continued diureses. he was startedon tube feeds with help from the nutritionists, and will begoing to rehab taking po.renal/gu: the patient came to the service with mildly reducedrenal function. upon receiving his ct his renl functiondeteriorated and was felt to have contrast nephropathy. over thenext week this resolved to his baseline.he responded well tolasix and metolazone diuresis as described above.heme/id: active issues included elevated inr (as describedabove), and positive cultures included strep pneumonia on sputumand 1/2 bottles of gpc bacteremia. his antibiotic courseintially was broad, including levaquin, ceftriaxone, vancomycinand zosyn (broad plus double coverage). this was tailored downto ceftriaxone  to cover the strep pneumonia that was speciatedfrom the sputum. the patient started requiring slightly higherpressor support 1.5 weeks into admission, started spikingnocturnal fevers, and subsequently grew the coag negative staph.he was broadened again for this, though was felt this was likelycontaminant. his fever curve and white count normalized and thecourse of antibiotics was d/c'd. he also developes somediarrhea, but c.diff was negative x 3 (got po flagyl untilnegative cx came back)prophylaxis: remained on sch, then hep gtt/coumadin,
