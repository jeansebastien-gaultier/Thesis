f/u blood,  urine, and respiratory cultures                - will hold off on empirically starting abx based on urinalysis (if we were to start abx, would                  recommend vanc/cefepime given micro history)- culture if spikes                - consider repeat abd imaging if pt continues to have a leukocytosis and doesn&#8217;t clinically                  improve2. anemia &#8211; source of anemia has been unclear in the past. during last admission, pt was found to be guaiac positive on rectal exam but guaiac negative out of colostomy. gi at that time had deferred colonoscopy. it is possible that her anemia may be responsible for her failure to thrive.                 -
