statushpi:  70 y/o female with pmhx significant for pituitary adenoma s/p resection, cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with confusion for the past 3 days. patient confused and unable to give history at time of admission. as per son and daughter, they have noticed increasing confusion and inappropriate behavior over the past 3 days. they report that she has woken up in the middle of the night c/o feeling weak and confused. the first two nights, her son treated her  initially with increasing lactulose administration when she would wake up at night (although it is unclear whether she had any increase in her stool) and he reports that she would behave better during the day. on the night prior to administration, the patient urinated in her bed at night and called her daughter on the phone in the middle of the night. she also forgot the names of her grandchildren. the son became worried about her behavior, contacted her pcp, and brought her to the alh ed.the family reports that she experienced similar behavior prior to grand-mal seizures that were a consequence of uncontrolled hypertension about 2 yrs ago. she also suffers from chronic uti's and often becomes confused during times of infection.ed course: vitals t 98.2, hr 64, bp 215, 115, rr 24, sa02 100% nrb. blood pressure: treated with labetalol 10 mg iv x 1, hydral 10 mg iv x 1, decreased to 176/74. hyponatremia: ns x

discharge summaries in ypz, patient had two episodes of general tonic-clonic seizures at osh prior to transfer to alh. extensive neuro work-up at alh including mri/mra, carotid non-invasives, tcvs, eeg, lp revealed no definitive etiology of seizure but thought to be likely related to her uncontrolled hypertension with systolic bp 250's, her morbid state in setting of uti, and lower seizure

there is mild periportal edema and     copper deposition, consistent with chronic cholestasis. there is     no mallory's hyaline.  there is no evidence of hemachromatosis,     alpha-1-antitrypsin

who presents with increasing confusion and depressed mental status.1.	change in mental status1.	hyponatremia - euvolemic by exam, serum sodium 125, serum osm 262, urine sodium 126, urine osm 387. consistent with siadh (euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, uosm>100, una>20). will place on fluid restriction, follow correction rate slowly. past na levels: 130 (10/91), 135 (6/91), 133 (1/91). other etiologies: diuretics, polydipsia, adrenal insufficiency, hypoaldo, third-spacing less likely. 2.	hepatic encephalopathy - known cirrhosis, on home standing lactulose. by exam, no asterixis. abdomen obese but no obvious fluid collection. somewhat tender, no peritoneal signs. will schedule for abdominal u/s to r/o ascites. low suspicion for sbp, will hold off prophylaxis antibiotics.3.	hypertensive encephalopthy - history of mental status changes and seizures with elevated blood pressures in the past. extremely hypertensive upon presentation to the ed. will continue to titrate up beta-blocker as tolerated, map goal reduction of 25% obtained, will continue to lower with po agents. consider mri to look for ple changes.4.	infection - history of chronic utis. u/a negative, cxr negative. will send blood cx and urine cx to complete fever work-up. 5.	standard work-up - tsh, rpr, b12, folate, cortisol2.	diabetes - finger sticks with sliding scale insulin coverage qid3.	hypothyroidism - check tsh, t4, t3. recent adjustment to synthroid dose. 4.	prolactinoma - check prolactin level, have patient bring in home cabergoline for weekly dose._________________________________taquan q. cantu, mdpager #30547
