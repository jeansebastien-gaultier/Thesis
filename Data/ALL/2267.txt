compatible with chronic atrophic gastritis.there was no bleeding in the duodenum.the patient was kept on strict nothing by mouth andintravenous fluids, and her hematocrit levels were followedto keep her hematocrit above 30.  her hematocrit droppedinitially from 30.3 to 27.4 and then to 22.6.  she wastransfused 2 units of packed red blood cells, and herhematocrit has been stable since, ranging from 30 to 32, withno further episodes of bleeding since [4-12].  she hasremained on a proton pump inhibitor (protonix) twice per day.a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [4-14]showed still adherent clot about 8 cm in length and 2 cm inwidth, adherent to a 2-cm length mucosa within the largehiatal hernia.  there were no signs of active bleeding.electrocautery was applied to the base of the clot in anattempt to dislodge it from the esophageal mucosa and forhemostasis; however, despite the clot still remained adherentto the esophageal mucosa.  it appeared that there may be anulceration and mucous in the area of the esophagus to whichthe clot was adherent.  otherwise, the stomach and theduodenum were normal on the repeatesophagogastroduodenoscopy.the patient was kept nothing by mouth for the remainingportion of [last name (lf) 766], [4-14], and was continued on intravenousfluids.  since her hematocrit remained stable on thefollowing day ([4-15]), she was started on clear liquids inthe morning, and diet may be advanced to soft solids untilher repeat upper endoscopy next week which has already beenscheduled.since her hematocrit has been stable for the last severaldays, the patient is safe to be discharged to home or torehabilitation.an upper endoscopy followup has been scheduled with dr. [last name (stitle) 21140]and dr. [last name (stitle) 2161] at the endoscopy unit on the [location (un) 448] of[hospital ward name 1950] one [hospital ward name 516] building on [2104-5-8] at 9:30a.m.  the patient should not have anything to eat aftermidnight on [2104-5-7] and should not eat breakfast on themorning of [2104-5-8] (on the morning of theesophagogastroduodenoscopy).her aspirin and plavix should be held considering hergastrointestinal bleed, and restarting of these twomedications will be made after her repeat endoscopy on [5-8].  the patient should remain on protonix 40 mg by mouthtwice per day until her repeat endoscopy, and she shouldavoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs until herprocedure.  the patient will also probably benefit from acolonoscopy as an outpatient.  helicobacter pylori antibodywas still pending.2.  thrombocytopenia issues:  heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia antibody was positive, so the patient shouldnot receive any heparin.  the patient has a history of a mildpancytopenia in the past, and this issue was discussedbetween the patient and dr. [last name (stitle) 410] of hematology/oncology,and it was decided that no bone marrow biopsy would beperformed.  the patient should follow up as an outpatientwith her primary care physician to insure that she has a risein her platelets.3.  hyperkalemia issues:  the patient had an initialpotassium value of 6 with peaked t waves onelectrocardiogram.  this was thought to likely be due todehydration, and the blood sample was also moderatelyhemolyzed.  otherwise, her potassium has remained stable.4.  congestive heart failure issues:  the patient does havean element of diastolic dysfunction, and so her fluid statuswas carefully monitored a she was getting significant amountsof fluids and packed red blood cells.  she has maintainedstable oxygenation, and good oxygen saturations, as well asgood urine output.5.  coagulopathy issues:  the patient developed an inr of1.4; likely secondary to being nothing by mouth for many daysand deficiency in vitamin k.  she has been given by mouthvitamin k and should continue this for two more days.  herinr will likely decrease when she receives adequatenutrition.6.  coronary artery disease issues:  as mentioned above,aspirin and plavix were being held secondary to a largegastrointestinal bleed.  the patient should continue to holdthese two medications until her repeat endoscopy on [5-8];at which time the decision as to whether to restart thesemedications can be made.  the patient has been restarted onher beta blocker.  she will continue with her statin, imdurbeta blocker, and ace inhibitor.7.  chronic renal insufficiency issues:  the patient'screatinine is at baseline.  her blood urea nitrogen waslikely increased secondary to bleeding and has now returnedto [location 213].8.  left leg pain issues:  the patient had a previous zosterinfection that was treated with valtrex.  on admission, shehad no evidence of a zoster infection with no rashesapparent.  the patient has multiple musculoskeletalcomplaints that have been chronic.  she was continued on herneurontin for neuropathic pain.  the patient was also giventylenol for pain control.   she does not have an activezoster infection.9.  psychiatric issues:  the patient was continued on herbuspar.  she has multiple somatic complaints; likely anxietyrelated.10.  acidosis/fluids/electrolytes/nutrition issues:  thepatient's acidosis was improving as her diarrhea improved.it will likely continue to improve as she maintains a normaldiet and her diarrhea continues to decrease.   she wasstarted on a clear diet on [4-15] following heresophagogastroduodenoscopy since her hematocrit has beenstable.11.  prophylaxis issues:  the patient was maintained onpneumatic boots and a proton pump inhibitor.  the patientshould not receive any heparin secondary to positiveheparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody.12.  access issues:  the patient has difficult access issuesand two peripheral intravenous lines through most of herstay.13.  code status issues:  the patient is a full code.14.  disposition issues:  at the time of this dictation, aphysical therapy consultation has recommended benefit fromrehabilitation for maximum safety.  the patient is beingscreened for rehabilitation at the time of this dictation.discharge diagnoses:1.  gastrointestinal bleed.2.  anemia.3.  chronic renal insufficiency.4.  coronary artery disease.5.  anxiety/depression.discharge status:  to rehabilitation.condition at discharge:  stable.medications on discharge: 1.  protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day. 2.  metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day. 3.  nystatin 5 mg by mouth four times per day as needed (forthrush). 4.  gabapentin 300 mg by mouth twice per day. 5.  cepacol one lozenge by mouth as needed. 6.  oxycodone 2.5 mg to 5 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed. 7.  tylenol 1000 mg by mouth three times per day. 8.  ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth once per day. 9.  buspar 5 mg by mouth twice per day.10.  mirtazapine 30 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.11.  isosorbide mononitrate extended release 45 mg by mouthonce per day.12.  atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.discharge instructions/followup:1.  the patient was instructed to follow up with her primarycare physician in one to two weeks.2.  the patient has a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopyscheduled for [5-8] at 9:30 a.m. with dr. [last name (stitle) 21140] and dr.[last name (stitle) 2161] at the endoscopy unit, [location (un) 448] of [hospital ward name 1950] one,[hospital ward name 516] building.  the patient should register in thelobby of the [hospital ward name 1826] building at 8:30 a.m. and should nothave anything to eat after midnight on [2104-5-7].  sheshould not eat breakfast on the morning of [2104-5-8].3.  esophagogastroduodenoscopy reports have been sent withthe patient to rehabilitation, and the patient should bringthese papers with her to her esophagogastroduodenoscopyappointment.
