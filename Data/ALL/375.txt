encasement is present .the portal vein , although stretched in places , it does not encase .the vena cava is patent , displaced , but not thrombosed or encased .there were no major arterial abnormalities .the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 68 beats per minute , with first degree av block , with a mild intraventricular conduction delay , with poor r-wave progression consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction , clockwise rotation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .there were non-specific st-t wave abnormalities .principal procedure :exploratory laparotomy , resection of retroperitoneal liposarcoma , partial right hepatectomy , partial left hepatectomy , cholecystectomy , excision of part of the diaphragm , right nephrectomy and
