admission date :2010-08-30discharge date :2010-08-31service :medicinehistory of the present illness :this is a 33 - year-old asian-caucasian male with a history of type 1 diabetes , asthma , alcohol abuse , and personality disorder / depression admitted on 2010-08-28 for persistent hypoglycemia .the patient complained of diaphoresis , confusion , dizziness , lightheadedness after drinking a 24 ounce beer and taking at least an extra 15 units of nph insulin the evening of 2010-08-27 ( later reported over 70 u insulin administered from 2.30 pm until time of presentation ) followed by not eating dinner .his symptoms mildly improved after eating a candy bar .the ems was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be 61 and noted to be 41 in the emergency department .he denied any seizure activity , loss of consciousness , incontinence , shortness of breath , fevers , or chills , chest pain , change in urinary or bowel habits , or suicidal ideation .he has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses , his wife had just kicked him out of the house .he has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing , usually denied .the wife also states that he drinks more than he states .in the emergency department , he received 3.5 amps of d50 and then d5 normal saline and d10 normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the icu team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted .he also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol .his fingersticks are currently in the 200 s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between 90-200 per the patient .the patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant / right rib cage pain and new headache .he also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged .he denied visual changes , lightheadedness of dizziness currently , neck stiffness , or pain in any other area .hospital course :1. hypoglycemia :the patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin ; however , with glucose repletion both in the emergency department and in the icu , this resolved and the patient also began to eat .we checked fingerstick glucoses q.i.d. and at 3:00 a.m.his glucose on the morning of discharge was about 60 so we opted to decrease his p.m. nph dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin .he should also continue having a snack at midnight if able .it is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with richard natalie diet .2. alcohol abuse :it is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits .he did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in 2009-09-03 .he had been on a diazepam ciwa scale prophylaxis against dt s; however , he had a very low ciwa scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines .this alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the psychiatry quincy medical center .we had also requested a social work consult regarding this .3. depression vs. borderline personality disorder :the patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life , it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth .he received a one-to-one sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the psychiatry healthsouth new england rehab hospital to ensure the patient 's safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment .he will need close follow-up regarding his depression as an outpatient , although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through .4. history of high blood pressure :his blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of 130s systolic during his admission , thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past .5. right upper quadrant pain :we obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as lfts , amylase , and lipase which were all normal .he had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys .it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause .6. prophylaxis :he was put on pepcid for gi prophylaxis .7. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition :he complied with linda chad diet while hospitalized .the patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of neutra-phos during his icu stay .he was given two doses of calcium carbonate 1 gram , and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion .he has been asymptomatic .
