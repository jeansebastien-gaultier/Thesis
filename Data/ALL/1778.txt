to thewadl uhump medical center on february , 1998 for further management ofhis myocardial infarction.past medical history: 1. history of renal carcinoma status postnephrectomy in 1994. 2. non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.3. mild hypercholesterolemia which is not currently being treated.4. renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy with a baselinecreatinine of 2.0.medications: glyburide.

allergies.social history: he has a 35 to 40 pack year history of tobacco.he rarely drinks alcohol , and denies any drug use.physical examination: the patient is a pleasant , overweight man inno acute distress. vital signs: the patient had a temperature of98.4 , heart rate 77 , blood pressure 143/78 , respirations 18 , andoxygen saturation of 91 percent on three liters by nasal cannula.heent examination showed pupils that were equal , round , andreactive to light and accommodation. conjunctiva were anicteric.extraocular movements are intact , and his oropharynx was clear.neck examination was supple with his jugular venous pressure atapproximately 8.0 centimeters. there was no lymphadenopathy.chest examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally , with norales. heart examination was regular rate and rhythm with anon-displaced pmi and a positive s3. there was no murmur.abdominal examination showed an obese , soft abdomen with positivebowel sounds. there was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. nomasses were palpated. the extremities were warm with no edema. hehad 1+ femoral pulses bilaterally. his left lower extremity had a1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. his right lowerextremity had a 1+ dorsalis pedis pulse with a nonpalpableposterior tibial pulse. neurological examination , he was alert andoriented x three. cranial nerves 2 through 12 are intact andsymmetric. he had 5/5 strength throughout. deep tendon reflexeswere 2+ throughout with downgoing toes bilaterally.laboratory data: laboratory studies from ter memorial hospital showed a sodiumof 139 , potassium of 4.5 , chloride 109 , co2 of 21 , bun of 22 , andcreatinine of 2.2. glucose was 236. liver function tests werewithin normal limits with an alkaline phosphatase of 95 , totalbilirubin of 0.4 , and ast of 39. cpks were 151 , 163 , and 163 withno mb fractions done. his tni was less than 0.2 to 0.3. he had awhite count of 14.2 with a hematocrit of 42.9 and platelets of 222.his triglycerides were elevated at 303 , and his cholesterol waselevated at 265 with an hdl fraction of 32 and an ldl fraction of172. his prothrombin time was 11.3 , partial thromboplastin time28.4 , and inr 0.85. urinalysis was negative. an electrocardiogramwas performed at the time of admission which showed resolution ofthe st elevations. he had t wave inversions in v2 through v4 , andflat t waves in v5 through v6.hospital course by problem: 1. myocardial infarction: he wascontinued on a heparin drip , lopressor , and lisinopril. hisdigoxin was discontinued at the time of admission. nitroglycerinwas given only p.r.n. he remained symptom-free throughout hishospitalization. his elevated cholesterol was treated. heunderwent cardiac catheterization on july , 1998 which showed 50percent left main obstruction and 90 percent complex mid leftanterior descending. his right coronary artery was occluded. thepatient did well both during and after the catheterization. thepatient underwent a stress mibi test with a viability study on january , 1998 which showed ischemia during his exercise tolerance test.the mibi showed severe ischemia in 11/25 segments , as well as aninfarct on the apical septum , apex , and base of the inferior wall.options were considered including coronary artery bypass graftingand angioplasty. after a long discussion with the cardiologyservice , cardiac surgery , the renal service and the patient , thedecision was made to proceed with angioplasty. on july , 1998 ,the patient underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronaryangioplasty of his right coronary artery with zero percent residualblockage. he also had two stents into his left anterior descendingwith zero percent residual blockage. the patient tolerated theprocedure well.2. renal: the patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma forwhich he underwent a nephrectomy in 1994. he also has chronicrenal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy. as surgery was beingconsidered for his cardiac disease , a renal consultation wasobtained to evaluate his renal status. he underwent a renalultrasound showing an exophytic mass in his solitary kidney. thiswas very concerning for recurrence of carcinoma. he then underwentan mri study which showed a nonenhancing mass in the kidney whichwas most consistent with a hyperdense , proteinaceous cyst. thiswas reassuring , though cancer could not be ruled out 100 percent.the patient's renal function remained stable throughout hishospitalization.3. non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: the patient wasplaced on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization. hewas instructed to continue with his glyburide , and to follow-up asusual with his outpatient provider.the patient was discharged to home on october , 1998 , one dayfollowing his second catheterization procedure. the patient didvery well following the procedure , and had remained pain anddyspnea-free.discharge medications include: 1. enteric coated aspirin 325 mgp.o. q.d. 2. lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. 3. lopressor 12.5 mgp.o. three times per day. 4. nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingualtablets , one sublingually every five minutes x three as needed forchest pain. 5. axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.h.s. 7. glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. 8. ticlid 250 mg p.o.b.i.d.follow-up: the patient was instructed to follow-up with hisprimary care physician , and to call the office to schedule anappointment. the necessary follow-up with cardiology and with thenephrologist will be scheduled as an outpatient.dictated by: cedric bongers , m.d. tt96attending: ty o. langton ,
