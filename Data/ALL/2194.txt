, stage iii.treatment included lumpectomy and chemotherapy. the patient hadpersistent pancytopenia , which was evaluated in 6/15 with bonemarrow aspirate biopsy , which showed multiple cytogeneticabnormalities with findings consistent with myelodysplasticsyndrome. in 7/17 , she had a nonmyeloblative peripheral bloodstem cell transplant for a match unrelated donor. in 2/3 , shehad lymphocyte infusion. on 0/29 , chimerism study showed 58%donor origin. repeat chimerism on 2/28/05 showed 100%chimerism. the patient prior to admission for two weeks haddiarrhea , watery in nature. she denied sick contacts , had gibiopsy in middle of 1/5 that showed focal colitis , withoutsigns of gvhd. the patient was given prescription for steroidsthree days prior to admission , but did not

thereis no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated on clinical exam. she haslarge external hemorrhoids. there is no clubbing , cyanosis , oredema. neurological exam is nonfocal.hospital course:1. oncology: the patient has a history of mds , 11 months statuspost nonmyeloablative transplant. the patient was very slow toengraft and required donor lymphocyte infusion. most recentchimerism studies on 2/28/05 showed a 100% donor origin. thepatient had stage iii skin gvh confirmed by biopsy on 9/18/05.she had moderate improvement response to solu-medrol , which wasstarted on 4/7/05 ( switched to prednisone on 9/23/05 ) andelidel started on 10/30/05. there has been even more improvementin the skin gvh since initiating rapamycin on 0/13gut gvh/diarrhea. gi biopsy done on 10/9/05 showed grade iigraft versus host disease in left transverse colon , grade i graftversus host disease in rectum , with no viral cytopathic changes.the patient had no significant decrease in the amount of stoolswith solu-medrol , marginal response to rapamycin , now with someimprovement status post three doses of ontak. ontak was given on9/15/05 , 0/4/05 , and 5/6/05 without adverse events. thepatient was premedicated with pepcid , steroids , benadryl , andtylenol. the only side effect is marked increase in left upperextremity edema ( see cardiovascular section for more details ).solu-medrol iv was started 2 mg/kg/day , started on 4/7/05 ,changed to 2 mg/kg by mouth oral steroids on 0/20/05. begantapering with steroids at 100 mg b.i.d. on 2/1/05 , decreased to80 mg on 10/2/05 , and down to 60 mg twice daily on 10/23/05.rapamycin was started on 10/28/05 , goal level between 3 and 12.the patient has been therapeutic since initiating therapy. sheremains on gvh diet , coordinating with dietary and kitchen forcorrect menu. she also has been on lactose-restricted diet thathas helped the stool volume as well.2. hematology: the patient with no active bleeding wastransfused for hematocrit less than 26 and platelets less than20. she did have intermittent bright red blood and clots instool , most recently on 2/11/05 and 4/30/05. this wasattributed to have large hemorrhoids that were found oncolonoscopy. she remained hemodynamically stable throughout.3. infectious disease: the patient remained afebrile throughouther hospitalization , maintained on prophylactic medication ofmepron and acyclovir. cytomegalovirus viral load on 0/18/05 ,4/7/05 , 10/9/05 , and 10/28/05 , all negative. cmv viral loadon 0/4/05 was pending at the time of this dictation. thepatient is to remain on acyclovir and mepron once transferred.4. cardiovascular: the patient remained hemodynamically stable ,did not get hypotensive throughout the admission.5. extremities: the patient had left upper extremity swelling ,markedly worsened , starting on tacrolimus , as this is known tocause capillary leak syndrome due to an ultrasound of the leftupper extremity on 2/4/05 , which is negative for dvt. etiologyis likely due to lymphedema secondary to axillary resection whenthe patient had breast cancer and capillary leak syndromeassociated with ontak. the patient had an echocardiogram toassess the etiology of peripheral edema , which showed an ejectionfraction of 60% , mild aortic insufficiency , and aortic stenosis ,borderline diastolic dysfunction , normal right heart , and minimalpericardial effusion.6. pulmonary: the patient had one episode of dyspnea whenspeaking on 4/23/05 , which resolved without further symptomsthroughout the admission. the patient had chest x-ray on10/9/05 , which showed small left pleural effusion without otherabnormalities.7. gastrointestinal: mouth , the patient had dry mouth , likely acomponent of graft versus host disease using ice chips and mouthcoat is helpful to her. she should continue this throughout.8. gut: the patient had persistent loose stools improved ( seeoncology section ). clostridium difficile testing sent on10/3/05 and 8/4/05 were negative. she had intermittent brightred blood per rectum that was related to external hemorrhoids , asstated above in gi section.colonoscopy on 10/9/05 revealed stage ii gvhd on biopsy with nogross visual evidence of bleed. as the fact now , the patient wasadmitted on 6/13/05 with bright red blood. the colonoscopy wasnotable for large hemorrhagic mucosa , intubating internalhemorrhoids , and at that time biopsies were negative for graftversus host disease. this was on 8/6/05. liver transaminitison 9/16/05 , likely due to ontak would be followed as anoutpatient. the patient also had transient lft abnormalitieswhen first admitted and has since resolved since discontinuingbactrim. the bilirubin remained normal. the patient wasasymptomatic.9. rectum: the patient had anusol as needed for hemorrhoids.she was not a candidate for surgical intervention due toimmunosuppression and infection risk.10. renal: the patient repeated increasing creatinine to 1.3.she maintained a level of 0.9 to 1.2 throughout the last fewweeks before discharge.11. fluids , electrolytes , and nutrition: the patient has markedperipheral edema. diureses worked well. the patient was up to18 kg above admit weight and now she is only 3 kg up from theadmit weight on 10/23/05. she is on lasix 40 mg twice daily bymouth. this is likely secondary to combination to venousinsufficiency , steroids , and low albumin. in the setting ofontak , she was given albumin and lasix three times daily , whichis no longer needed now that she that would not be pursuing ontaktherapy until an outpatient attending decides , otherwise. sheshould have a goal i/o negative to 1 to 1.5 liters a day.monitor hemodynamics closely if the patient has been noted to bedehydrated. encouraged ambulation and for elevation we wereusing ace bandage like wraps. the patient had electrolytesmonitored and repleaded as needed. nutrition was following.12. endocrine: the patient's fingerstick blood sugars were 134and 163 , improved since steroids taper initiated. she remainedon the sliding scale as needed , likely this is due to steroids.13. dermatology: the patient upon admission had significantinvolvement of skin due to gvh greater than 80% body surface areainvolved. it is improved significantly , as the exam revealedless erythema , darkening rash , and decreased distribution. thepatient is on gvh medication , as stated in oncology section. shealso came in with macerated areas under both breast and wastreated with miconazole powder and had improved by the day ofdischarge.14. access: the patient had double lumen hickman catheter ,which is erythematous surrounding exit site. the cuff has beenexposed for months , although the patient has had no fevers , nottender , outpatient attending requested to keep it lying in.social disposition:the patient accepted at dwan uoswe chehamp hospital center we had familymeeting on 10/2/05 with all siblings and patient's son agreed ononce the patient is at home , need for increased support ,medication compliance , mitchel hursey , social worker from tinmasca hospital is following dr. kringasdischarge condition:stable.discharge medications:include acyclovir , anusol , bactroban , prednisone 60 mg by mouthtwice daily , mepron 750 mg twice daily , celexa , sirolimus 4 mg bymouth once daily , caltrate , vitamin d , and nexium , tacrolimus 1%lotion twice daily to
