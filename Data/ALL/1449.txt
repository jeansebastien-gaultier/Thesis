this was per the emergency room staff.extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. neurologicexam revealed cranial nerves iii through xii were intact. he wasalert and oriented x three. motor and sensory exam revealed 5/5bilaterally. reflexes were 0 to 1+ bilaterally and symmetrically.toes were downgoing. he had normal bulk and tone throughout.x-ray: chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe infiltrate , and thiswas per the ontmang hospital . a repeat chest x-rayhere on 11/27/95 again showed extensive left upper lobe pneumonia.electrocardiogram: the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinusrhythm at 89 with occasional prematureventricular contractions. he had a q-wave inversion in lead 3 andavf , biphasic v3.laboratory data: fluid balance panel revealed sodium 131 ,potassium 3.4 , bun and creatinine 23 and 1.4 ,chloride and bicarb 98 and 23 , glucose 194. his ldh was elevatedslightly at 259. his other liver function tests were within normallimits. his total protein was 5.7 , albumin 3.0. his hemoglobinand hematocrit were 14.4 and 43.3 , respectively. white blood cellcount was 12 , 100 with a differential of 84% polys , 5% bands , 6%lymphs , and 2% monos. platelet count was 188 , 000. his urinalysiswas significant for white blood cells and red blood cells that weretoo numerous to count. he had 3+ bacteria.hospital course:problem #1: pneumonia , left upper lobe. the patient received 1 g.of cefuroxime at the sontro cle healthcare and wastransferred to the termmette medical center where cefotaxime1 g. eight hours was begun. the patient continued to spiketemperatures on hospital days #1 and #2 , although blood and urinecultures remained negative. on hospital day #3 , erythromycin wasadded to his antibiotic regimen as the patient continued to spiketemperatures. the following day , the patient defervesced andremained afebrile throughout the hospital course. as mentionedearlier , a repeat chest x-ray here again showed extensive leftupper lobe pneumonia. clinically , the findings from the physicalexam showed a resolution of the bronchial breath sounds. on theday of discharge , the patient's lungs were clear to auscultationbilaterally. the patient had been afebrile for four days and hadbeen on erythromycin orally for two days. the intravenouscefotaxime was also discontinued two days prior to discharge atwhich point the intravenous erythromycin was changed to orally at500 mg. q.i.d. the patient was instructed that he should avoid theuse of tobacco as this would increase his likelihood ofredeveloping pneumonia as well as increase his likelihood ofworsening cardiac disease. a sputum sample was induced , and it wassent for routine culture and afb culture and smear. the cultureswere negative , and the afb smear was negative for mycobacteria.the cultures were negative on discharge.problem #2: urinary tract infection. the patient was treatedwith cefotaxime which was also used for treatment ofhis pneumonia. he was noted to have urinary incontinence , and byreport , the incontinence had begun approximately four or five daysprior to admission. it was felt that the incontinence might besecondary to his ongoing infection. a repeat urinalysis was sentapproximately four days after admission and showed 1 to 2 whiteblood cells and 0 bacteria. the patient , at that point , no longerwas having urinary incontinence; however , he was noted to have alarge postvoid residual of 300 cc. it was felt that this might berelated in part to mild benign prostatic hypertrophy. dr. nydam ,his primary care physician , is aware and will pursue furtherwork-up as necessary.problem #3: ataxia. the patient was noted by the family membersto be somewhat ataxic at home. the onset of thisataxia was in relation to his current illness; however , given thefact that he was on coumadin , and due to the fact that he hadsustained a fall in the evening of admission , a ct scan wasperformed to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. the ct scan wasnegative for hemorrhage and showed age-appropriate atrophy. aneurology consult was also requested , and recommendations for thect scan , as already discussed , were made. in addition , theyrecommended that we check an rpr , b12 , folate , and tsh. theresults are as follows: rpr was nonreactive. the first draw ofb12 was 233 , which is slightly low normal. a repeat b12 was 564 ,which is within normal limits. his folate was normal at 4.9. histsh was slightly low at 0.44. a physical therapy consult was alsoobtained to assist the patient with exercises to improve hisstrength. by discharge , the patient was able to ambulate withoutdifficulty. he was having no ataxia , whatsoever. we feel , inpart , that some of this ataxia may have been related to generalizedweakness that was associated with his current illness.problem #4: diabetes mellitus. on admission , the patient'sglucose was 194. due to his oral intake , we electedto hold his glyburide and to give him insulin subcu. on a slidingscale basis as needed. by hospital day #4 , the patient's p.o.intake had improved , and we resumed glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. daywith sliding scale p.r.n. we continued accucheks on a b.i.d.basis. his glucose tended to run in the low 200s. his glucosewill need to be followed as an outpatient , and perhaps one mightconsider a glucometer for him at home to ensure that he has goodglucose control.problem #5: hematologic. the patient was admitted on coumadin ,which he takes as follows: 2.5 mg. alternating with3 mg. on admission , his inr was 1.8. his inr was rechecked on7/16/95 and was noted to be 4.8. his coumadin was held for a coupleof days , and his inr was rechecked on the day of discharge; it was2.4 on the day of discharge. we feel that the elevation in his inrwas probably related to his being on antibiotics. i have mentionedthis to his primary care doctor , dr. reimer he will follow up onhis clinic visit on monday , 7/22/95.laboratory pending on discharge: legionella antigen , obtained on1/19/95. repeat stool forclostridium difficile toxin on 7/4/95 ; however , the patient'sdiarrhea has diminished , and we do not think that this is relatedto clostridium difficile.discharge medications: atenolol 50 mg. p.o. q. day. cardizem-sr120 mg. p.o. b.i.d. erythromycin 500 mg.p.o. q.i.d. x eight days. glyburide 5 mg. p.o. q. day. lovastatin20 mg. p.o. q. day. coumadin 2 mg. p.o. q. day. nitroglycerin 0.4mg. tablets sublingual q. five minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain;the patient is to notify the m.d. if the pain fails to resolveafter three tablets or if he should become light-headed whiletaking those tablets.condition on discharge: good.disposition: the patient is discharged to home.follow-up: the patient will follow up with dr. elvis alcantas inclinic on monday , 7/22/95.dictated by: claude terrian , m.d.attending: roosevelt j. oakeson , m.d. pe99yx724/7128batch: 6875 index no. uwogpf7s5q d: 11/2/95t: 2/3/95cc: 1. vern k. ihnat , m.d. pe99[report_end]
