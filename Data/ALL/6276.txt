and abdominal pain since sunday. imagingat osh significant for likely cholecystitis. deemed poorsurgical candidate so transferred to [hospital1 18] for consideration ofpercutaneous drainage by ir.active diagnoses:# cholecystitis: on arrival patient was with high-gradeleukocytosis, fever, and significant abdominal pain and nausea.she was admitted to the micu for concern for evolving sepsis.she underwent ruq u/s here with findings that could beconsistent with acalculous cholecystitis. she was evaluated inthe ed by general surgery who felt she was not an idealoperative candidate and suggested hida scan and evaluation by irfor percutaneous cholecystostomy. egd also evaluated her butdeferred to ir given the lack of obstructive findings on herlft's. ct torso and hida scan were negative for cholecystitisbut did demonstrate dilated gall bladder. ct torso alsodemonstrated known large diaphragmatic hernia with stomach andbowel in the left chest with mild stranding and old po contrastfrom osh possibly c/w recent inflammation of the intrathoracicbowel. ir thus felt there would be little benefit fromintervention. patient was started on vanc/zosyn, becameabdominal pain free, afebrile, with a downtrending white countand was called out to the floor for further management. thepatient did well on the floor. her vancomycin was discontinued.she remained on zosyn and completed a 7-day course in house.symptoms resolved at the time of discharge.# transient somnolence: patient has multiple late morningepisodes of transient somnolence with normal finger sticks,normal abg's, and no clear seizure activity. she had a ct headwhich was negative for acute process. this was thought to be theresult of oversedation from meds (iv morphine, klonopin prn, pmamitryptiline, and antiemetics). her level of alertnessspontaneously resolved following these episodes.# diarrhea - on the floor the patient had a number of episodesof diarrhea. a c. diff was negative. she was maintained on ivf.her vancomycin was stopped as above. the patient's bowel regimenwas stopped. the diarrhea improved.  bowel regimen may beresumed as outpatient prn.# depression: the patient endorsed acute on chronic decrease inappetite long with insomnia and anhedonia.  this was felt to  bedue to worsening depression.  nutrition evaluated her and feltthat she need maximal supplementation of her diet.  thepsychiatry team evaluated her while she was in the hospital andstarted mirtazapine 7.5 mg qpm (1 hour before meals). on thelast evening of her admission she was able to sleep.  herdepression should be monitored while on this medication forsigns of improvement.  she warrants ongoing evaluation of hersymptoms and medications.  at the moment she appears wellnourished, but if her diet and appetite do not improve withtreatment of her depression then nutrition felt she mightrequire tube feeds and evaluation for peg tube.  this wasbriefly discussed with her son, [name (ni) ] [name (ni) 110281].  given that she isstill recovering from an acute abdominal insult, it was feltthat further evaluation could take place on an outpatient basis.# urinary retention: the patient was noted to have problems withurinary retention after having her foley pulled.  if she doesnot produce urine she will need to be bladder scanned andpossibly straight cathed if scanned for > 500.  at the time ofdischarge she was incontinent of urine.chronic diagnoses:# copd: treated for exacerbation with rapid steroid taper inearly [month (only) 547]. no active wheezing on exam. continued on nebsin-house.#
