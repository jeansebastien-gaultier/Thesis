[last name (stitle) 1147] was involved in the care of thispatient on a day to day basis and frequently added input tothe care of his supraventricular tachycardia.3.  gastrointestinal bleed:  after intubation and placementof a nasogastric tube the patient was noted to have evidenceof an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  the gastroenterologyservice was consulted and performed an endoscopy anddiscovered events of trauma from the nasogastric tube thatwas thought to be the cause of this self limited uppergastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation for theparoxysmal atrial fibrillation.  the patient was withoutevidence of gastrointestinal bleed throughout the remainderof his hospitalization.4.  hematuria:  during the patient's intensive care unitcourse the patient developed gross hematuria in the settingof continuous indwelling foley catheters.  this hematuria wasassociated with a brief drop in the patient's hematocrit,which required 2 units of packed red blood cells fortransfusion.  after continuous bladder irrigation thehematuria resolved and the patient was without such findingsthroughout the remainder of his hospital course.5.  fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  the patient wasmaintained on tube feeds throughout his intensive care unitstay and received a percutaneous feeding tube placement andwas tolerating tube feeds at goal at the time of discharge.condition on discharge:  fair.discharge status:  to rehab.discharge diagnoses:1.  respiratory failure.2.  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.3.  influenza.4.  paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.5.  atrial fibrillation.6.  hematuria.7.  emphysema.discharge medications:1.  metoprolol.2.  colace.3.  bisacodyl.4.  nicotine patch.5.  doxazosin.6.  albuterol.7.  atrovent8.  fluticasonefollow up plans:  the patient is to contact dr.
