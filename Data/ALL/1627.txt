present illness: the patient is a 68 year old gentlemanwho has a past medical history ofnon-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease ,and peripheral vascular disease who had a revascularizationprocedure with a left femoral popliteal bypass graft in november of1998. since that time his foot has become cool and the graft hasbeen noted to be occluded. he presents for a re-operation forrevascularization.past medical history: non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.coronary artery disease status post coronaryartery bypass graft in 1991 and series of angioplasties prior tothe coronary artery bypass graft. gastroesophageal reflux disease.non-healing left foot ulcer with no osteomyelitis. hypertension.peripheral vascular disease.medications: glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.a.m. , glucophage 850 mg p.o.t.i.d. , lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , lopressor 50 mgp.o. q.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. , simvastatin 10mg p.o. q.d. , and nph 10 units subcu q.p.m.past surgical history: in 1991 he had a coronary artery bypassgraft. his postoperative course wascomplicated only by atrial fibrillation which was medically managedand he has been without recurrence since that time. in november of1998 he had a left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibialartery bypass graft with non-reversed greater saphenous vein andleft common femoral endarterectomy with dacron patch angioplasty ,as well as debridement of the left lateral foot wound. after thissurgery , he had an uncomplicated postoperative course.social history: the patient quit smoking in the fall of 1998 anddoes not use alcohol.family history: noncontributory.review of systems: he has had no chest pain , shortness of breath ,or angina since the time of his bypass. justprior to his admission , he was seen by dr. frankie krampitz of harlsti conon memorial medical center cardiology and was cleared from a cardiacstandpoint saying that he was an average risk for surgery as he hasdone well from his prior surgeries and has had no symptoms sincehis bypass surgery. additionally , his preoperative angiogramshowed his superficial femoral artery graft to be proximallyoccluded with mid to distal reconstitution. above the kneepopliteal artery , there was mild diffuse disease. below the kneepopliteal was patent. there was diffuse proximal disease in theperoneal and posterior tibial arteries. the posterior tibialoccludes above the knee and there is high grade focal stenosis atthe anterior tibial origin. the dorsalis pedis is patent.hospital course: on 5/21/99 the patient was brought to theoperating room where dr. moises performed a leftfemoral above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft. this went withoutcomplications. the type of graft used as a 6 mm dalcron graft.the immediate postoperative pulse examination was notable for apalpable femoral popliteal and graft pulse with a dopplerabledorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse on left side. thepatient had an ecg postoperatively that showed no significantchange to his preoperative ecg. he was started on heparin at 8p.m. the day of surgery.of note , on postoperative day #1 , the patient got very diaphoreticand nauseous. at that time an ecg was done that showed nosignificant change and , throughout that episode , he had nohemodynamic instability. this was likely secondary to havinggotten up rather quickly and likely a vasovagal event.throughout the rest of his hospitalization course the patient wasmobilized with physical therapy. he had a dopplerable dorsalispedis pulse , posterior tibial pulse , and peroneal pulse on leftside throughout his entire hospital course. however , the graft wasno longer palpable by postoperative day #2 but it was stronglydopplerable.the patient was continued on heparin until his coumadin reached thehigh 1 level which was achieved on 5/26/99 when his inr was 1.6. atthis time his heparin was discontinued. the anticoagulation is onfor keeping the graft patent and not for any cardiac or strokereasons. the goal on his inr will be approximately 2 to 2.5. on5/26/99 the patient was stable for discharge. his pulse examinationwas notable for dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse and posteriortibial pulse and peroneal pulse.the patient's record of coumadin in response with inr is asfollows: on 5/21/99 the patient was started on coumadin at whichpoint his inr was 1.0. on that day he got 5 mg of coumadin. thefollowing day , 9/28/99 , his inr was 1.1 and he got another 5 mg ofcoumadin. on 1/30/99 the patient's inr was 1.2 and he got another 5mg of coumadin. on 10/28/99 the patient got 7.5 mg of coumadin andhis inr was 1.2 at that time. on 0/6/99 the patient got 10 mg ofcoumadin and his inr was 1.6 the following day on the day ofdischarge , 10/14/99. on the day of discharge , 5/26/99 , the patientwill get 7.5 mg of coumadin and his predicted daily dose will beroughly 7.5 mg of coumadin p.o. q.d.disposition: discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mgp.o. q.d. ( this is a critical medicine and he shouldbe on this at all times despite being on coumadin ) , colace 100 mgp.o. t.i.d. , iron 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , glyburide 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,nph insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , czi insulin sliding scale to get4 units of regular insulin for blood sugar over 201 to 250 , 6 unitsof regular insulin for blood sugar of 251 to 300 , 8 units ofregular insulin for blood sugar of 301 to 350 , and 10 units forblood sugar 351 to 400 and , greater than 400 , house officer is tobe called. lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. , demerol 50 to 100 mg p.o.q4h p.r.n. pain , lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glucophage 850 mgp.o. t.i.d. , and coumadin p.o. q.d. to be dosed according to dailyanticoagulation tests as stated previously with inr goal of 2 to2.5.dictated by: samuel nard , m.d. mu29attending: junior vanstrom , m.d. ji90vi171/7093batch: 3570 index no. wcmoht6m46 d: 11/6/99t: 11/6/99cc: 1. rehabilitation hospital ( 467 ) 088-2778[report_end]
