confirmed with pvr in umh edassessment/plan: the patient is an 74 yo male with a history of cad, pvd, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive r foot claudication x 2 weeks.  his vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis. he will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.plan:-          systemic anticoagulation w/ iv heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr-          home meds-          npo past midnight-          mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99-          plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05this patient was discussed with dr. francis pratt, vascular surgery fellow.    __________________________________kenneth felton msiiiumh ed surgerypager 59917agree with above note, changes made.jerry f. addisoned surgery senior residentpager 79915
