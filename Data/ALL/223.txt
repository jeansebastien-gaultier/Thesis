with righ sided pna(mrsa/pseudomonas) and severe hypoxia requiring significant o2suppplementation..1. pna with severe hypoxia: had right multilobar pna withmrsa/pseudomonas growing from sputum, with wbc count of 9,000and bandemia as high as 22%, elevated anion gap, and elevatedlactate to 2.4. also has poor underlying lung function from copd(fev 1.2l in [2181-7-20]) and h/o right upper lobe lobectomy.patient was initially treated with high flow face mask of 15 lat 40% with additional nc with saturations varying from 88 to98%, but with continued frequent coughing which causesdesaturations. the patient has since decreased his oxygenrequirement to venti amsk at 12 lpm with o2 sats rangin 89 to97%. the patient continues to cough and is draining sputum wellwith transition from dark brown thick sputum to thinnergrey/clear sputum. the patient had one episode small volumeblood tinged sputum on [2181-9-24] attributed to inflammation fromunderlying pna. the patient is currently being treated withlinezolid for a planned 21 day course for mrsa as well asceftazidime, again for a planned 21 day course for pseudomonas.amikacin was added for syndergy and to avoid resistance with aplanned 14 day course (ending dates specified on dischargemeds). the patient will be discharged with need for  continuedo2 suppplementation to keep sats >90% and <94% with o2 weaningas possible. the patient will continue to require ongoing chestpt and physical therapy as well..2. copd: has h/o copd on montelukast, spiriva, advair, flovent,prednisone 10mg at home with pft's showing fev of 1.2 l (42%predicted), fev1/fvc ratio of 42 (59% predicted), 6 l tlc, andelevated residual volume (193% predicited). he was given advair,monteleukast, prednisone 60 mg daily tapered down to 30 mg dailyas well as atrovent nebulizers. the patient is followed by dr.[last name (stitle) 14069], his outpatient pulmonolgist with whom he should continueto be followed after discharge..3. anxiety: patient was experiencing a significant amount foanxiety during this admission, likely at least partlyattributable to his air hunger. the patient was maintained onclonopin with hold parameters with ativan rescues as needed..4. acute renal failure: patient presented with arf with cr to2.8 which resolved rapidly with fluids down to baseline of 0.7..5. chest pain: had right sided chest pain, which is diffuse andpleuritic, likely due to pna. treated with mssr 45 mg [hospital1 ] and ivmorphine for breakthrough pain..6. abdominal pain: patient has been experiencing ongoingabdominal pain for a few days. a kub showed a non-obstructivebowel gas patterns and the patient's ostomy continues to drainwell. the patient has good appetite without nausea/vomiting. c.diff was negative x 1. the patient did have an elevatedamylase/lipase, now trending down. pain did not radiate to backand again patient was tolerating po well without anyexacerbation of pain. the patient's symptoms are exacerbatedwith coughing and are likely secondary to musculoskeletal strainfrom frequent coughing. treating pain as above with ms sr 45 [hospital1 ]with rescue doses..6. transaminitis: presented with elevated liver enxymes whichtrended down to normal. hepatitis panel negative for hep b or c..7. h/o lll nodule and several other areas of focal scarring:should be followed with serial ct scans in the future byoutpatient providers..8. h/o right upper lobe lung ca: not active currently. sputumfor cytology was negative for malignant cells. no history ofchemo or radiation..9. h/o thrush: likely related to inhaled staeroids. continuedhis outpt nystatin..10. steroid induced hyperglycemia: treated with 70/30 insulin[hospital1 ] at am dose of 40 and pm dose of 22..11. anemia: labs consistant
