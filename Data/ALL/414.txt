or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:[age over 90 ] yo female with hx of htn, afib, ? pe, multiinfarct dementiaand recurrent uti who presents with lethargy, hypoxia, and leerythema. pt is aphasic at baseline. per notes from ed and pcpcoverage, the patient was being treated for recurrent uti with acourse of levofloxacin started on [6-7] but was otherwise doingwell. last night she was noted to be more lethargic than normalwith increasing sob. she was noted to be hypoxic with o2 sats of80% so was transferred to the ed.in the ed she had a fever to 101.8 with intermittent hypoxiathat improved to 98% with 4lns oxygen . she was givenclindamycin 600mg iv x1 for le cellulitis and a dose oflevofloxacin 500mg iv for possible uti. for her hypoxia, she wasgiven 20mg iv lasix and a combivent neb with significantimprovement with cta neg for pe and leni neg for dvt. shecontinued to have intermittent hypoxia of unclear etiology sowas transferred to the [hospital unit name 153] for closer monitoring..in the micu, the patient was treated with ctx and vanc foruti/cellulitis. also diuresed. patient improved and sent tofloor [6-11] on 2l nc. patient noted to have increased eos inblood and urine so ctx stopped and placed on levo/macrodantin..[6-13] patient decompenstated on the floor. patient desatted to80's on 6l nc. abg 7.46/52/63 on 6l nc. patient initially withhr in 80's. patient given lasix 20mg iv x 1 and an alb neb. thenwent into afib with rvr into the 140's maintaining her pressure.patient given 5mg iv lopressor x 3 with out response in hr.transferred back unit for further mgt of hr and hypoxia, whereshe was started on a diltiazem drip; cta was without evidence ofpe. course complicated by persistent hypotension requiringmultiple fluid boluses; this resolved after the discontinuationof the diltiazem drip. she was started on an amiodarone loadwith conversion into nsr. her o2 sat improved with diuresis. apicc line was placed and she was started on aztreonam (insteadof macrobid) for uti. she was transferred back to the generalmedical floor on [2175-6-16]. currently, she has a new rash over hertrunk and arms bilaterally--thought to be from ceftriaxone.past medical history:cva-with multiinfarct dementia-aphasic at baselineafibutizoster-l thoraxsyncopepehypothyroidismdjdsocial history:divorced, lived alone in [location (un) 7349] until
