thistumor. it was found to be increasing in size and she was treatedon gleevec from [1-/2145] to 12/[2146]. at that time, she stopped itas she was having some side effects from this therapy, mostnotably severe cramping. on the gleevec, her tumor had decreasedin size. however, the mass grew while she was off the gleevecand she was restarted on it again in 07/[2149]. she was restartedat 200mg daily to avoid issues with cramping.- on [2151-6-29] she had a ct scan which showed new liver lesionswhich were concerning. an ultrasound was obtained [2151-7-13] whichshowed these lesions and raised concern for metastatic disease.- she was increased from gleevec 200mg daily to 400mg daily on[2151-9-8].- she had stable ct scans and the liver lesions were determinedto be cysts, she was decreased from 400mg daily to 200mg dailydue to nausea on [2152-4-5].-ct scan [10/2152] there was increase in size of a right uppermesenteric nodule with no other enlarging disease. her case wasdiscussed previously and surgery is an option. at this time sheis interested in trying 400mg gleevec to see if thiscontrols/shrinks this mass. if the mass continues to enlarge shewould consider
