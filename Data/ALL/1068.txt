myocardial infarctionother problems: 1. status post cholecystectomy2. asthmahistory of present illness: the patient is a 41 year oldafro-american woman who has thediagnosis of inferior wall myocardial infarction on 4/26/95transferred from rahert hospital for postmyocardial infarctionangina.cardiac risk factors: hypertension , smoking , family history ofcoronary artery disease , and cva. nodiabetes. she is not postmenopausal , no history of elevatedcholesterol. no previous myocardial infarction history.two and a half weeks prior to admission while sorting mail , she had20 minutes of cushing substernal chest pressure , increasedshortness of breath with diaphoresis and radiation down the leftarm and across to the right chest. initially , she thought she hadgastrointestinal distress. pain often appeared 1 to 2 hours aftereating , was not associated with exertion , and is questionable ifaffected by position. there were no ekg changes. in the interveningperiod she had several additional episodes of this pain andpresented to hmc where she was treated with disalcid and tagamet.the pain persisted in a crescendo pattern until 4/26/95 when shepresented to lssha with a complaint of two days of unrelenting chestpressure. she was sent to ai community hospital where she ruled in formyocardial infarction with a ck equal to 1508 mb fractions. mb of126 with a peak of 1900 on 8/6 ekg demonstrated q waves in 3 andadf. t waves aversions of 2 st segment depressions in v2 throughv5. she was treated with iv nitroglycerin , heparin , oxygen ,diltiazem , metoprolol and aspirin. she apparently had additionalpain while on this regimen and was transferred to the campte hospital for catheterization and management.medications: her medications as an outpatient were onlyhydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day. upon transfer hermedications included colace 100 mg b.i.d. , aspirin 325 mg once aday , diltiazem cd 240 mg once a day , metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d. , ivnitroglycerin , iv heparin , and percocet for pain.allergies: no known drug allergies , but has an allergy to seafood- she gets hives.family history: as above. coronary artery disease andcerebrovascular accident in the early 40's in bothher father and mother.social history: she smokes one pack a day of cigarettes for thepast 20 years with occasional alcohol.physical examination: upon admission to the coronary care unit atthe mouth- butlham hospital is notablefor a blood pressure of 130/85 , the pulse is 79 , respiratory rateof 16 to 20 on three liters of 100% face mask. heent exam -sclerae are anicteric , pupils equal and reactive to light ,extraocular movements are intact , oropharynx were clear. there wereno carotid bruits , jugular venous pressure at 6 cm flat. chest -there was a poorly healed scar on the anterior chest. lungs wereclear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally. no cvatenderness. cardiac exam - pmi nondisplaced , regular rate andrhythm , normal s1 , split s2. there is a 2 out of 6 whooshingcrescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the left upper sternalborder that radiates to the apex. there was an s4. abdomen - obesewith a surgical scar in the right upper quadrant. nohepatosplenomegaly. femoral pulses are intact with a right bruit.extremities were without edema , symmetrical distal pulses.neurologic exam was nonfocal. reflexes were intact. toes weredowngoing bilaterally.laboratory on admission: notable for potassium of 3.8 , a whiteblood cell count of 13.6 , hematocrit of37.8 , platelets of 179 , magnesium 2.3 and ck of 201 , pt-ptt 13.2 ,59 with an inr of 1.2. urinalysis was notable for 25 to 30 whiteblood cells , 5 to 10 red blood cells , 2+ squamous cells , 1+leukocyte esterase. there were no effusions or evidence of failureon chest x-ray.hospital summary: on admission this is a 41 year old woman withmultiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in foran inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencingpostmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current anginaversus pericarditis , although there was no ekg evidence to supportthis. in the ih she was treated with heparin , beta blocker ,aspirin. calcium channel blocker was discontinued. ivnitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. the patient was scheduled fora catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer withpretreatment of 60 mg of prednisone x two for history of shellfishallergy. the patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 10/12/95with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 ,pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. there was a third om( first large om was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive withgood distal flow. ) the remainder of the coronary arteries weredeemed normal. on the 7 of october , the patient was transferredout of the coronary care unit to the stepdown unit. of note ,postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruiton the right which was there prior to catheterization. anechocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50%with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. on the7 of october , the patient was noted to have a white blood cellcount of 20.7 at this time , ptt of 74.3. ekg was notable for t waveinversions in 2-3-s , v2 through v6 which were seen on ekg's from1/7 the patient's mi was felt to be consistent with a lesionfrom the thrombus seen on catheterization. it was thought at thistime that the increased white blood cell count was most likelysecondary to the prednisone given as pretreatment prior tocatheterization. the patient's does of lopressor was increased to75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. she wascontinued on the stepdown unit on heparin , iv nitroglycerin andcontinued on cardiac monitor. on the 29 of july , the patienthad an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the leftarm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slightdiaphoresis. at note , at this time , the iv nitroglycerin was beingweaned down. her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulseof 80. cardiac exam was notable for a normal s1 , s2 and s4 , no newmurmurs noted on exam. lung was clear. ekg was notable to be asinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with t wave inversion and 3 and rwhich were old , as well as st segment elevations of 1 mm in v2which were old and suitable normalization in v6. she was given onesublingual nitroglycerin and the iv nitroglycerin was dialed up.she was likewise given 5 mg iv push of lopressor for recontrol andserax 15 mg x one. her chest pain was reduced to 2 out of 10 withthese interventions with no radiation in the arm. she described itas a heaviness. blood pressure was 144/87 , pulse was 74. ekg atthis point was notable for sinus rhythm at 75 , normal intervals. twave inversions in 3r st segment elevations of 1 mm in v2 , v3 , v5with t wave sinusoidality and v6 t wave slightly inverted. ivnitroglycerin was dialed up further , morphine 2 mg x 1 was dividedand oxygen two liters , nasal cannula was in place. patient waspain-free with these interventions and a second 5 mg iv lopressorwas given for better late recontrol. duration of total episode wasapproximately 20 minutes. the pain-free ekg was notable for a rateof 78 wit v5 t wave more upright than sinusoidal and v6 t waveupright , else no change. the iv tng was dialed up further for ablood pressure of 129/76 and rate was now 70. a second bolus of ivmorphine was obtained at this time. ck and isoenzymes were sentand cardiology attending was made aware. the patient was made npoin case of any need for catheterization the following morning ifsymptoms were to recur. the ck following this event was magnifiedwith a triponin i of 14.1. on the 29 of july it was deemedappropriate to continue with the iv heparin one more day andcontrol symptoms with iv nitroglycerin. if the symptoms were toincrease , it was still deemed appropriate to considering thispatient for recurrent cath. on the 20 of february , the patientreturned to catheterization which demonstrated a discrete 90%distal left circumflex stenosis. there was a ptca performed of thisdistal stenosis which left a residual 60% stenosis. a stent wasplaced in the distal stenosis to provide a 0% residual stenosis.the lesion in the proximal circumflex developed a greater than 50%stenosis during the procedure , and two stents were placed in theproximal left circumflex to provide a 0% residual stenosis for atotal of three stents in place in the left circumflex. ekg's werestable postcatheterization. there was no remarkable hematoma in theright groin. ck postcatheterization was 64. on the 18 of novemberthe patient's lopressor was changed to atenolol and the patient wasstarted on coumadin for the stents. the patient at this time on6 of october had a heart rate in the 68 to 75 range with ablood pressure of 120/75% , o2 sats were 99%. as the patient wasbeing coumadinized on the 18 of february , she had asupertherapeutic response coumadinization with an inr of 5.7. theplan was to recheck the inr to secure a downward trend as well asto start planning for discharge. on the 24 of april , the inrwas 4.6 , demonstrating a downward trend with a subsequent maximuminr , while supertherapeutic , of 6.5.discharge: the patient was discharged home on june withfollowup with dr. mathur and dr. stailey at the for nali hospitalmedications on discharge: aspirin 325 mg po b.i.d. , anusolsuppositories one suppository pr q day ,atenolol 125 mg po q day , colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , lisinopril 5 mgpo q day ,
