recentlyinvolved in a motor vehicle accident , and has had left pressuresince the accident. his cardiac history began in 26 of september , when hesuffered a non-q-wave myocardial infarction. a cardiaccatheterization at that time revealed a 90% proximal left anteriordescending lesion with anterolateral akinesis , which was treatedwith angioplasty. he had a limited stress test on 18 of july , whichwas limited by symptoms of chest pressure. the electrocardiogramand thallium done at that time were both unrevealing. the patientwas involved in a motor vehicle accident in july , and then againin january , 1991. he suffered multiple contusions , but no fractures.subsequent to the accidents , however , he described having leftflank and left side pain , which was exacerbated by movement and wasassociated with the development of his left substernal chestpressure. nitroglycerin did seem to provide him some relief. thepatient was seen recently at laclare's bouldwalt in rockoxsiford au for chestdiscomfort , and electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes did not showany evidence of myocardial infarction. the patient has continuedto complain of chest discomfort over the past month , but allelectrocardiograms have been negative. an exercise tolerance testwas performed at tygib haysbonne valley hospital , which was positive forchest discomfort and for st depressions in the inferolateral leads.thallium examination was not performed because of infiltration ofthe intravenous access. he was transferred from jacklip on 22 of november , for further work-up and possible cardiaccatheterization.physical examination: on admission , the patient was a wellnourished , well appearing young black male.his blood pressure was 130/80 , pulse 55 , respiratory rate 12. lungswere clear. cardiac examination revealed s1 , s2 , with an s4present , the jugular venous pressure was 5. the patient had 2+carotid upstrokes without bruits. the abdomen was soft , good bowelsounds , with left-sided tenderness and left flank tenderness topalpation. extremities showed no edema and good distal pulses.neurologic examination showed cranial nerves intact , motorexamination showed some decreased power on the left , but this wasthought secondary to pain. sensory examination was normal , and hisplantar reflexes were downgoing.laboratory examination: on admission , potassium was 4.6 ,creatinine 1.3 , alt 155 , ast 80 , ldh 228 ,creatinine kinase 79 , cholesterol 212 , triglyceride 316 , whiteblood count 6.1 , hematocrit 39 , prothrombin time 13.5 , partialthromboplastin time 89.4. admission chest x-ray showed noabnormalities. admission electrocardiogram revealed normal sinusrhythm at 56 beats per minute with some inverted t-waves in leadsii , iii , f , and v2 through v4. the inverted t-wave in lead iiappeared to be new from a transfer electrocardiogram.hospital course: the patient was admitted on 22 of november , and was seenby the dental service for his atypical painradiating to the neck. his cardiac risk factors included apositive family history and a smoking history of less than 1 packper day. he had no history of diabetes or previous hypertension.the

leftanterior descending artery with a 70% stenosis. the patienttolerated the cardiac catheterization well without hematoma orbruit in the right groin. the patient continued to have episodesof chest pain with 5/10 left-sided sternal chest pain without clearelectrocardiogram changes from the admission electrocardiogram. heunderwent an exercise tolerance test which showed he had 4/10 chestpain prior to beginning the exercise tolerance test , but then gotworsening chest pain during the test after 8 minutes and 15seconds , peak heart rate 160 , blood pressure 166/40. he diddevelop 1 millimeter of downsloping st depressions in the lateralleads , and a pseudonormalization of the t-waves. the results werediscussed with the patient and the options were discussed , that ismedical management versus a repeat angioplasty or possible surgery.the patient preferred medical management and wanted to be at hometo see if increased medical management would stabilize his chestpain. the patient was discharged on 9 of septemberdisposition: the patient was discharged to home. he was to haveclose follow-up and management of his cardiac diseasewith the cardiology group. medications on
