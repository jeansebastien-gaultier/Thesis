[known lastname ] is a [age over 90 ] yo lady with a history of copd, chf,alzheimer's and expressive aphasia, who presented from hernursing home to the ed in respiratory distress on [2152-7-26] about1.5 hours after eating her lunch. she has had an episode ofaspiration about one year ago as well as urosepsis a few monthsago. in the ed, her vitals were t 98.9f, hr 130, bp 158/66, rr40 and o2 sat of 91% on rl. a chest xray taken showed widespreadcoarse reticular opacities but no signs of consolidation. shewas given solumedrol given her history of copd. she was alsostarted on iv vancomycine and aztreonam (due to a pcn allergy)as well as metronidazole. she was also given 1l normal salinefor alactate of 4.7.  ekg showed sinus tachycardia. she was thenadmitted to the micu for further care.in the micu, her aztreonam was dc'ed, and she was started oncefepime instead. she was also started on an insulin slidingscale. her lactate returned to 1.3, and her cre and wbc trendeddown as well (wbc 26). her iv fluids were tricky since any flow>75cc/hr led to hypertension with sbp int he 170's. however, shewas able to tolerate small boluses of fluids. a straight cathperformed also showed purulent liquid, though her urine culturesfrom [2152-7-25] were negative. after a few hours in the micu, shewas transferred to the floor.review of systems:limited by patient's mental statuspast

admission ekg read yesterday by cardiology, whowas concerned about possible acute event. however, ekg comparedwith one in [2142], which also showed similar changes. troponinselevated at 0.06 x 2 but did not trend up, likely from transientischemia due to increased cardiac demand [12-30] infection. no signsof acute cardiac event. medical management with beta blocker,asa discussed with family, who declined due to allergy to asaand desire for minimal medication.  patient did toleratebeta-blocker (metoprolol 6.25mg) for one dose and seemed to perkup afterwards, but given difficulty in administration here inthe hospital (took patient an hour to swallow pill) did notcontinue.  can be considered as outpatient.# sepsis: resolved. likely secondary to a uti. grossly positiveua though urine culture was negative, pmh of recurrent utis,recent admission to [hospital3 ] with urosepsis frommulti-drug resistant e.coli, necessitating treatment withprimaxin. straight cath in micu drained purulent material. urineculture showed no growth, but per pt's son, pt had alreadyreceived iv abx at that time. plan to complete 7 day course ofceftriaxone on [2152-8-3].# volume status: tenuous. per micu and patient's son, patientbecome hypotensive with no fluids but rapidly becomeshypertensive (up to sbp of 170's)if fluids given too fast. atpresent appears to respond well to slow small fluid boluses, ata rate of 75-100cc/hr. was continued on ivf at 40cc/hr per ptsson as an amount that she has tolerated well in the past.# diabetes mellitus type ii: started on iss on [2152-7-26], but npo,became hypoglycemic and iss was downtitrated in the micu.changed to regular insulin sliding. glucose stable. januvia heldwhile inpatient and continued to use reduced dose insulinslididng scale.  can restart januvia on d/c.# sacral pressure ulcer: wound care recs -
