record date: 2102-08-28gibson internal medicine intern admission notepatient:  grace marvin yandellmrn:  8099832admit date:  8/27/02pcp:  unknowncc:  tx from mount san rafael hospitalhpi:  80f with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p r. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to san rafael mount hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.  at that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.   as per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ed but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to rafael mount ed.five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in anchorage and treated for dehydration.  upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.  during the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her lfts secondary to lft elevation on laboratory exams.at present, pt. c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal cp (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.  she reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.  hospital course: mrsa bacteremia:  blood cultures at san rafael hospital grew s. aureus and pt. was started on iv vancomycin.  the bacteremic source remains unclear.  tte on 8/01/02 showed an ef of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.  a tee on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.  her r. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.  a bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on mri in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f r. knee.back pain: pt. c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at msrh.  thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.  an mri of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the l. t10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the l. inferior aspect of t11.  the lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.  no epidural extension was noted.  there was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.  pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.  as per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.  a ct guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.  a neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at gch.    a repeat mri was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of t4, persitent abnl marrow signal in l. pedicle of t11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.  immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.  right breast mass:  a firm r. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of r. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at osh.  a mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  the r. breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  an u/s of r. breast showed no discrete mass.  a biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  renal failure:  pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.  her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.  repeat blood cultures were negative for s. aureus.  anemia: on admission to rafael hospital, hb/hct: 11.6/35.5.  she was started on procrit by hematology.  she was transfused on unit of prbcs in the hospital.tia:  pt. has a hx of tias with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and r. hand tingling.  an mri that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.  this finding was likely due to prior iv contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.  a brain mri on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior iv gadolinium.  no findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the l. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.  htn: pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.medical historyrecurrent syncope: 2086-2100, 3-4 events per year, last event prior to hospitalizationseizure disorder:
