apparent extension over the past six hours .there was also elevation of the ptt suggesting possible inborn coagulopathy .there is also critical anemia secondary to the subgaleal hemorrhage .he was admitted to the cmed ccu for further management .summary of hospital course by systems :1. respiratory :patient has been on room air maintaining sats above 95% .no apnea or bradycardia .2. cardiovascular :there was an initial murmur on admission likely secondary to severe anemia which has since resolved .he remained hemodynamically stable throughout this admission .3. fen :patient was restarted on po feeds as of day of life three after the bleeding had stabilized .he has been taking breast milk or enfamil 20 po adlib .his admission weight was 3850 grams .his weight on discharge was 4055 .4. gi :given the significant amount of bleeding , baby was started prophylactically on phototherapy .his bilirubin peaked on day of life three at 5.4 with a subsequent bilirubin of 4.6 at which time phototherapy was discontinued .5. hematology :given the rapid extension of the subgaleal bleed , coagulopathy workup was initiated revealing an elevated ptt level of 77 as well as factor 8 level that was below detection in the presence of normal factors 5 , 9 , 10 , and 11 .he was started on a 50 units / kg bolus of factor 8 followed by continuous factor 8 infusions at 50 units / kg / day divided until hourly infusion rates at 05-10 .subsequent factor 8 levels varied with an initial factor 8 level of 18 after the bolus with which he received another bolus of factor 8 of 50 units / kg

of 75 units / kg of factor 8 was 131 .a trough level at 20 hours after the bolus on day of discharge was 29 .he will continue to receive factor 8 bolus q day for a total of 2-3 weeks in light of the intracranial hemorrhage , and will be followed by hematology visiting nurse michael edwards level checks at home .currently , the infusion of factor 8 are going through a jugular broviac which was
