hypertensive urgency---hpi: 77 year old female with cad s/p three stents , dm , htn and ckdwas sent to ed by pcp after she presented to office with malaise ,nausea and lightheadedness. her symptoms first developed onthursday. she had checked her bs and bp at that time and they were300 and 150 systolic. her symptoms resolved but returned on sundaypta and persisted throughout the day so monday she went tosee her pcp. at the pcps office her bp was noted to be 212 systolicand she was sent to the ed for evaluation. of note , on route to thepcp office she had a fleeting episode of chest "cramping" whichwas unlike her previous angina or mi pain. ---in the ed: the patient received labetolol 10mg iv x2 , labetolol 400mgpo x1 , nitropaste 3". her bp remained above 200 despite thesemedications and then she received hydralazine 10mg iv x1 whichresulted in dropping her bp to 150 systolic.---pmh: see list.---meds at home: asa 81 , lasix 40 , plavix 75 , nexium 20 , valsartan160 , labetolol 400 bid

bp is not clear. there is no indication ofmed non-compliance. her pcp reports labile bps are a problem for her.her bp was controlled after she arrived to the floor. shewas resumed on her home dose of labetolol. there was discussion ofincreasing her labetolol dose but this ended up not being necessary.in fact she was symptomatic with a bp of 120 in terms offeeling lightheaded. therefore her hold parameters were increased to130 systolic. in addition she had occasional ectopic apical heartbeats which resulted in early qrs complex and occasionalslight pauses <2sec. no major events on telemetry. her heart rate wasrelatively slow around 50-55 much of the time. her ekg did showslight ( 1mm ) st segment depressions in antero-lateral leads and herckmb was elevated on admission. she ruled out for mi with three setsof neg troponins. she may have had slight demand ischemia in settingof hypertension. her ckmb was normal on day of discharge. her troponinswere always negative. she had no s/s of chf. she was monitored ontelemetry with no major events.---renal: the patient is a diabetic and in addition reports a recenthistory of contrast induced nephropathy. she had proteinuria onadmission which is slighly higher than usual ( 3+ compared to 2+ ) buther creatinine was improved from baseline to 1.6 ( 1.8-2.2 ). a renalultrasound showed normal kidneys with no hydronephrosis. upep , spepand spot urine/protein were ordered. her spot urine protein was 222. herproteinuria in a chronic problem. upep/spep need to be followed up asoutpt but suspicion for malignancy is very low.---endo: the pt has history of dm and takes lantus and humolog at home.she missed her lantus dose the night of admission and subsequent ambs was high. she received nph to cover her for the hd#1 and thenshe resumed lantus that evening. she also received her home humulogand a sliding scale. she received a carb controlled diet. her tsh was1.2 on home levoxyl.---fen: her lytes were repleted as needed.---gi: her renal ultrasound showed sludge in the gallbladder and aslightly distended cbd. bili t and d were added and are normal. she hadno abd pain or tenderness so her gallbladder sludge is not likely torepresent a pathology.---additional comments: 1. monitor your bp at home and call your pcp if >180.2. monitor fingersticks at home three times a day ( before each meal ) andrecord in a note book to bring to pcp appointment3. return to ed if you experience chest pain , shortness of breath ,worsening nausea , extreme sweating , fainting , falling or other concernsdischarge condition: stableto
