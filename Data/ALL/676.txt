(he tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  the tone is only mildly increased.  sensation is intact.  reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (rue 2+/4, lue 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  the right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  he wears a right afo.  he can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.his examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  this was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  he has major stroke risk factors, including dm, htn, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.to review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in august, i will request the record of that hospitalization from dogc.  i will also request his records from his physician at the flagler hospital.  he will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  he tells me that he is planning to see his pcp for this purpose.  i asked him to return here in a month to review this.sincerely,patrick winn, m.d.
