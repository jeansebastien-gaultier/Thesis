patient was admitted and found to be pancytopenic butasymptomatic except a chronic non-productive cough that wasattributed to seasonal allergies. he underwent tte which showednormal lvef. he underwent bone marrow biopsy on [7-14] whichconfirmed diagnosis of aml. a triple lumen subclavian cvl wasplaced on [7-14]. he was started on 7+3 induction therapy on [7-14].he tolerated the infusion well and his anc fell to 0 on [7-22]. hewas thrombocytopenic and developed gingival bleeding with plt inthe 30s and was transfused as needed. he was also anemic andtransfused as needed. repeat bone marrow showedhypercellularity. patient was started on mec therapy andtolerated it well. his anc remained 0. repeat bone marrow on d14of mec showed hypocellularity. his counts gradually increasedand antibiotics were discontinued, he had been on broad coveragewith vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome (spent a lot of time in[state 15946]) and remained on these antibiotics until he was nolonger neutropenic or febrile.  counts continued to increase andat the time of discharge pt was no longer neutropenic and wbcwas 4.1.  bone marrow biopsy on [2158-8-28] showed no clonalcytogenetic aberrations and <5% blasts.  however, skin biopsyfor a purple-pink papular rash on both forearms with biopsy wasconsistent with leukemia cutis.  considering his bone marrowresponse and the resolution of this rash, it was thought to berseolved.  he will followup with dr.

levofloxacin which had beenprescribed for cough was discontinued. given the concern forhemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear, see below,flagyl was added. micafungin was added on day 4 after firstspike given continued fevers. pt. felt well and was ambulatory,taking po during this time. patient clinically improved, butthen developed high fevers, rigors, and whole-body rash,respiratory distress (see icu course below). he was pan-scannedagain, and ct sinus showed sinusitis. coccidio, beta-glucan,galactmannan, histoplasmosis, legionella, blood fungal cultureswere sent and were all eventually negative. id was consulted andsuggested removing cefepime and micafungin as they might causerash. he was placed on vancomycin, meropenem, and ambisome (foraspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage). patient had risenlfts which eventually trended down. he improved clinically andantibiotic coverage was stopped on [8-26] when patient had beenafebrile for several days and anc >1000.  beta glucan from [8-26]was >500.  id was consulted again and advised to recheck betaglucan, as it may have been an erroneous result, since he wasasymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest ct from [8-26], andalso requested a mycof/lytic culture.  these results are to befollowed up as an outpatient and no antifungal coverage orliver/spleen imaging were advised unlses the he spiked a fever,which he did not do..# guaiac positive stool: patient reported hard and painful bmduring induction therapy. bloody streaks were seen on stool,minimal blood in toilet. platelets transfused, hct stable. bowelregimen increased and further bms were guaiac neg and soft forthe rest of his hospital course.#hematuria: noted to have hematuria [8-15] in the setting ofthrombocytopenia.  ct abd/pelvis showed mild r hydronephrosisand proximal-mid hydroureter on [8-15].  hematuria resolved asthrombocytopenia resolved, platelets were transfused for <10.f/u ultrasound showed bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting ofincreasing creatinine, urology was consulted concerning thehydronephrosis and advised that he follow up as an outpatientfor a hematuria workup..#thrombocytopenia: pt had low platelets as expected and wastransfused prn for platelets <10.  on [8-20], had urticarialreaction to crossmatched platelets that improved with tylenol,pra assay positive.  thrombocytopenia improved withoutintervention as the rest of counts went up as well.#acute kidney injury: patient's creatinine was elevated starting[8-24] from baseilne of 0.9 to 1.8 on [8-29] despite removal ofnephrotoxic vancomycin and ambisome on [8-26].  renal wasconsulted and considering fena of 2.1, was thought to be due toain, although it is unclear which medication caused this.  hedid have a drug rash earlier in his hospital course, thought tobe related to micafungin or meropenem, but it is unclear whatcaused the ain.  he will followup with renal service as anoutpatient.#l 4th and 5th finger numbness: patient had noted thisconsistently for a week and mentioned it on [2158-8-24].  mri t andc spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for cns spreadof disease, in addition lp was done.  no lesions on mri and noevidence of cns disease.  numbness may be [12-27] ulnar neuropathy,he will follow up in neurology clinic and may get an emg..icu course ([date range (1) 29638])hypoxia: pt with increased o2 demand and some respiratorydistress which lead to his brief transfer from the onc serviceto the [hospital unit name 153]. pt was initially given nebs, changed from nc tofacemask, and given iv lasix. he was redosed with lasix withgood urine output. cxr showed no change and echo was obtained.pt o2 requirement stabilized and he was titrated down to lowerdose nasal cannula..febrile neutropenia: temp of 101.4 at time of icu transfer.broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated lftsraised concern over the administration of fluconazole. becauseof the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemicregions it was determined to treat emperically with ambisome sothis was started and fluconazole d/ced. near the end of thefirst ambisome infusion pt spiked a fever above 104 and hadchills/rigors. this calmed down with demerol and tylenol and wasthought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause..pancytopenia: this was thought [12-27] to aml and chemo with hgb lowon icu presentation. over brief icu course 1 unit of prbc wasinitially given followed by 2 units prbc the next day. pt hadmild temp at time of beginning of the 2nd transfusion but it wasadministered in spite
