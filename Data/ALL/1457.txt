initially ,high suspicion of pe , given h/o pe , evolution of pleuritic chest pain ,and svt. leni's were negative. she was empirically started on hepariniv. yet on hd2 , she had a v/q scan with no perfusion defect and heparinwas discontinued. the precipitating event leading to svt was notdetermined. no pe or evidence of ischemic event. however , she hadmultiple metabolic derangements , especially hyocalcemia ( ca 6.0 , ica0.79 , mg. 1.6 ) as well as evidence worsening structural heart disease andevolving cardiomyopathy. her svt resolved after adenosine 12 mg iv x 1and she remained in sr during the rest of hospital stay. echo showed ef40% , diastolic dysfunction and lvh likely 2/2 longstanding htn. thiswas a change from echo in 2002 when she had nl ef 60% , no e/o diastolicdysfunction and no ventricular enlargement. the cause of her newcardiomyopathy is possibly htn and concern raised for high-output statedue increase flow thru av fistula. we discussed the case briefly withthe vascular surg service. there is no definitive test to determine ifflow throught the avf is too great. this may need to be discussed betweenher primary renal doctors and vascular..hypocalcemia: vitd level pending , pth dramatically elevated at 914. notedto have elevated qtc of qtc 504 msec in setting hypocalcemia. calcitriolwas increased and calcium citrate was initiated. calcium was alsorepleted with calcium gluconate boluses and magnesium supplementation.ionized calcium was followed. she is being discharged home on calciumcitrate bid , calcitriol 2mcg qd , and prior dose of ergocalciferol..code: fulladditional comments: you were admitted after experiencing a rapid heart rhythm that normalizedafter treatment with medicine. there is no clear explanation for why youwent into this abnormal rhythm , there are a few possibilities. theseinclude disturbances in your electrolytes , such as very low calcium , aslow as changes in your heart from high blood pressure and fluidretention. you did not have a clot to your lungs or in your legs. youwere started on calcium supplements ( calcium citrate ) , calcitriol dosewas increased. metoprolol dose was increased to treat your high bloodpressure..key medicine changes:1. increase metoprolol dose2. increase calcitriol dose3. start calcium citrate: takes this medicine between meals , as it willbe less effective if taken with meals.4. it is important that you take all prescribed medicines to keep yourheart healthy and to make sure your electrolytes and calcium stay inacceptable limits. if you have problems filling your medicines , pleasenotifiy your primary or renal doctors..contact a physician or return to the emergency room if you developrecurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , sensation of rapid heartrhythm that does not go away after a few minutes or comes on withbreathing problems or chest pain.discharge condition: stableto do/plan:1. check metabolic panel , including calcium.2.
