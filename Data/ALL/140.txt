womanwith a history of myocardialinfarction , atrial fibrillation , hypertension and congestive heartfailure who presents with shortness of breath.the patient is status post inferior posterior myocardial infarctionon march , 1998. thrombolysis was deferred secondary to severehypertension ( systolic blood pressure was greater than 200 ).catheterization revealed 80% rca stenosis with thrombus. sheunderwent ptca and stenting and reopro under the lakeni ralton rooson hospital study.an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 45% , inferiorposterior lateral hypokinesis , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation , 2+mitral regurgitation , moderate aortic insufficiency. she wastreated with ticlid for 30 days , aspirin , lopressor , verapamil andcaptopril. that hospital course was complicated by asymptomaticparoxysmal atrial fibrillation in the setting of pneumonia and newdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism ( tsh less than assay , t4 16.1 , t3 133 ,thbr 1.24 ). she was started on procainamide and subsequently as anoutpatient on ptu without recurrence of atrial fibrillation. shehas been treated with coumadin. on april , 1998 , she was admittedfor left upper extremity weakness with a question of transientischemic attack in the setting of subtherapeutic inr. head ct scanwas negative and brain mri/mra was also negative. on september ,1998 , she was admitted to hillh hospital for flash pulmonaryedema requiring intubation. she was in normal sinus rhythm , buthypertensive. she ruled out for myocardial infarction and repeatcatheterization showed patent stent , otherwise unchanged. she wassubsequently started on lasix and was well until the night prior toadmission when she developed gradually worsening shortness ofbreath , wheezing and chest pain. also , she had an

admission ,no fever or chills. in the emergency room , her blood pressure wasfound to be 230/100 with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room airincreasing to 95% on two liters. she had crackles one-third of theway up her lung fields bilaterally. ekg was in normal sinusrhythm. chest x-ray showed edema and effusion. she improvedquickly with oxygen , nitrates and lasix.past medical history: significant

daughter and has a twopack per day smoking history times 40 years. she has no alcoholuse.physical examination: on physical examination , she was breathingcomfortably , supine at 30 degrees. vitalsigns: temperature 98.4 degrees , heart rate 61 and regular , bloodpressure 153/75 , respiratory rate 18 , with an oxygen saturation 93%on three liters. heent examination revealed that the sclerae wereanicteric. pupils were equal , round and reactive to light.extraocular movements were intact. oropharynx was benign. neckrevealed that the jugular venous pressure was elevated to her ear.carotids were 1+ on the right , 2+ on the left. there was aquestion of a right carotid bruit. there was no thyromegaly.lungs revealed crackles half way up bilaterally , no wheezing.cardiac examination was regular rate and rhythm with an s4 ,intermittent s3 , no murmurs. abdomen revealed normal active bowelsounds , soft and non-tender , mildly distended with a pulsatileliver. extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema. therewere 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally. there was no calftenderness. skin was warm and dry. neurological examinationrevealed that cranial nerves

,hematocrit 38.8 , platelet count was normal. ck was 44. troponinwas 0.03. inr was 1.8. ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 90 withold inferior qs , left ventricular hypertrophy with strain in i andl which were old , t-wave inversion in iii and v6 as well aspseudonormalized t-waves in v1 through v4 which are new comparedwith october , 1998. chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , pulmonaryvascular redistribution , kerley b lines , but no infiltrate.hospital course: 1 ) congestive heart failure: the assessment wasthat the patient presented in acute congestiveheart failure , most likely due to diastolic dysfunction in thesetting of hypertension. other contributing factors possiblyplaying a role in the patient's heart failure could have includedmedication non-compliance and dietary indiscretion. anotherpossibility entertained was that the patient could have hadtransient atrial fibrillation triggering heart failure , however allof her ekgs showed her to be normal sinus rhythm , questioning thispossibility. the patient was diuresed with intravenous lasix andstabilized on p.o. lasix during her hospital course.she ruled out for myocardial infarction by cks , troponin and ekg.2 ) hyperthyroidism: the patient's tsa was measured to be at lessthan assay on may , 1998 raising the possibility that uncontrolledhyperthyroidism could also be contributing to her cardiacdysfunction. an endocrine consult was obtained with therecommendation that her ptu be increased to 100 mg t.i.d. her t4and thbr were measured and found to be 8.1 and 0.91 which werewithin normal limits after the increased dose of ptu. the patientis to receive follow-up in the thyroid clinic for definitivetherapy , possibly iodine ablation of known thyroid nodules in herleft lobe.3 ) elevated white blood cell
