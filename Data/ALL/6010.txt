diarrhea, admitted withshortness of breath, tachycardia, and persistent nausea..#) cardiomyopathy: pt was initially admitted to the hospitalistservice but transferred for cath and endocardial biopsy in thesetting of worsening ef.  her cardiomyopathy was thought to bedue to lupus.  peripartum cardiomyopathy was also consideredhowever given the timing of onset and biopsy showing immunecomplexes seen on endocardial biopsy, lupus cardiomyopathy wasthought to be more likely.  she was treated with steroids,cytoxan, plasmaphoresis, ivig and supportive care, and improvedfrom an ef of 15 to 33%.  it is unclear which therapy led toimprovement.  she did require temporary ccu transfer formilrinone given worsening ef, however was weaned after a fewdays and transferred back to the floor in stable condition.  hermitral regurgitation and hypertension also contributed to herpoor forward flow, and htn improved with diuresis, hydralazine,lisinopril and amlodipine..#) schf, volume overload: on

symptomaticmanagement and she was discharged on oral torsemide.  she wasalso treated with bp control and bblocker therapy.  given hersob and le edema r>l, a le us was performed and showed no leclot,
