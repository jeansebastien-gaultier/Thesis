discharge diagnosis: unstable angina.identification: the patient is a 71 year old gentleman with ahistory of severe coronary artery disease whopresented with unstable angina with probable mesenteric ischemia.history of present illness: cardiac risk factors include a historyof hypertension , hypercholesterolemia ,remote history of smoking , questionable positive family history ,and no diabetes mellitus. the patient has had a history ofcoronary artery disease , is status post multiple myocardialinfarctions. in the 1970s the patient had a myocardial infarctionnumber 1 and in 1992 he had his second myocardial infarction , non qwave mi , refused catheterization. ett was done and he was treatedwith atenolol and isordil. in 2/25/93 the patient had an anteriormyocardial infarction and subsequently had a v-tach , v-fib arrest ,converted with 200 joules at mid-ma hospital and received tpa ,heparin , lidocaine , and his peak cpk value was 7975. echo revealedan ejection fraction of 20% with anterior apical akinesis , leftatrial enlargement. the course was complicated by post mi chestpain. on 4/17/93 the patient was transferred to rahfletchgreenesouth rehabilitation hospital of cardiac catheterization at that point revealed 90% ladlesion and 100% pda lesion , 90% d1 lesion , and the patient had ptcaof lad to a remaining 40% lesion and d1 ptca with 40% residual.post ptca course was complicated by flash pulmonary edema andanterior st elevation which led to emergent cath which revealed a70% lad , 100% d1 lesion , and this re-occlusion was treated withrepeat ptca of lad and intra-aortic balloon pump. the patient wasgiven captopril and lasix for ischemic cardiomyopathy. since then ,the patient was medically managed and in his usual state of healthwithout any chest pain for the two years until about three daysprior to admission when patient had vague abdominal pain ,epigastric ache , and cramp occurring intermittently , lasting for4-6 hour episodes. occasionally the patient was awaken from sleep.he denied orthopnea , pnd , edema. the patient's pain was similarto but not identical to peptic ulcer disease pain. the patientdenied chest pain. on 9/17/96 , the patient was seen by dr. mcgrayof pvh . the patient continued to have abdominal pain. patienthad chf on examination. an ekg revealed new lateral t wavechanges. the patient was sent to tanjuan tialan vition hospital and there thepatient became diaphoretic , was short of breath , improved withnitroglycerin and therefore was transferred to bert stern medical centerin the emergency room , the patient had shortness of breath , bloodpressure elevated to 210/110 , heart rate of 118 , continued to haveabdominal pain and development of chest pain typical of angina. hereceived lopressor , iv tng , aspirin , no heparin secondary toincreased inr to 2.8 , and his shortness of breath subsequentlyimproved. chest pain resolved. his ekg had t wave inversions inv5 through v6.past medical history: 1. significant for coronary artery diseaseas above. status post multiple myocardialinfarctions. ptca of lad. 2. peptic ulcer disease. 3.hypertension. 4. hypercholesterolemia. 5. status postamputation of right third distal phalanx. 6. history ofnephrolithiasis.admission medications: coumadin 3 mg q.h.s. , atenolol 25 mg p.o.q.day , captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , mevacor20 mg p.o. q.day , axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitro patch , andsublingual nitroglycerin.allergies: no known drug allergies.social history: the patient lives with brother. retired heavyequipment operator. he smoked 15 pack years andquit twenty years ago. alcohol occasionally.family history: positive coronary artery disease in two sisterswith myocardial infarctions.physical examination: temperature of 98 , heart rate of 72 , bloodpressure of 104/68 , respiratory rate of 16.oxygen saturation of 97%. heent examination revealed no jvd.cardiac examination showed regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6systolic ejection murmur at left lower sternal border. chest wassoft bibasilar crackles. abdomen was soft , non-tender ,nondistended. no hepatosplenomegaly. a ventral hernia was presentwhich was easily reducible. extremities showed no cyanosis ,clubbing , or edema. neuro examination was nonfocal. rectal wasguaiac negative per the emergency ward.laboratory examination: sodium of 144 , potassium of 3.5. he had ahematocrit of 43.6 and white blood countof 9.8. lfts were within normal range. pt of 20.2 , ptt of 38.2 ,inr of 2.8. abg on 100% face mask revealed 7.33 , 45 , 193 , 99.6% inthe emergency room. abdominal ultrasound in the emergency roomrevealed right renal stones , but no hydronephrosis , no gallbladderstones , no evidence of triple a. chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly ,low volume lungs without clear evidence of chf. ekg upon arrivalin the emergency ward revealed sinus tachycardia , t wave flatteningin avl , t wave inversion v4 through v6 which were new , poor r waveprogression which was old. pain free ekg revealed resolution of twave inversion in v4 through v6.hospital course: the patient was admitted for the rule out miprotocol. he actually ruled out for a myocardialinfarction with a cpk of 168 , cpk2 of 138 , and cpk3 of 147.however on 0/9/96 his t wave inversion in v1 and v2 were noted tobe deeper on c set compared to a set. subsequently that day thepatient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. as his iv heparinand tng were being turned down he became acutely short of breathwith bilateral crackles half way up the lung fields. he was foundto be in flash pulmonary edema which was treated with heparin , ivtng , and also lasix. the patient did very well after that and histroponin level at that point was 0. the patient's cpks wererecycled and the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction again.his abg at that point and during his acute episode of shortness ofbreath was 7.37 , 43 , po2 of 111 on 6 liters , and after diuresis hewas able to be on room air without any difficulty. it wastherefore decided for the patient to have cardiac catheterization.cardiac catheterization was performed on 7/21/96 which revealedproximally occluded lad , 60-70% lesion of om1 , and 99% lesion ofproximal pda , and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction withextensive anterior apical akinesis and also inferior apicalakinesis. based on this it was decided that the patient had threevessel disease. in anticipation of surgical conservation thepatient had a ett mibi on 11/27/96 and he was able to go on modifiedbruce protocol 6 minutes. he stopped secondary to fatigue. he didnot achieve target heart rate. his maximum heart rate was 104 and85% of the predicted value. subsequently the mibi results revealedanterior wall and septum and apex to be nonfunctional , however thepatient had known transmural myocardial infarction in inferior wallwhich revealed viable myocardium there and also lateral wallnonfunctioning wall. these are the preliminary results. it wasdecided for the patient to have maximal medical management prior toconsideration for surgery. the patient's isordil dose wasincreased while in hospital and his coumadin was restarted.discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , isordil 40 mgp.o. t.i.d , mevacor 20 mg p.o. q.day , lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.8h. ,nitroglycerin 1/150 p.r.n. chest pain. coumadin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s ,and axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.condition on discharge: the patient is being discharged in goodcondition.follow-up: with dr. ayoub the patient is to be seen within oneweek with dr. warmack of gardmond hospital forcardiology , and dr. bartolomeo of thoracic surgery per dr. ondrusekrecommendations. the patient has been chest pain free since0/9/96 , since he had the episode of flash pulmonary edema. hisheparin was discontinued on 7/24/96. the patient remained chestpain free with good oxygen saturation and was not short of breath.dictated by: landon gabrel , m.d.
