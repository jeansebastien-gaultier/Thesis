complaint:shortness of breathmajor surgical or invasive procedure:intubation, arterial line placementhistory of present illness:this is an 80 year old female with history of bronchiectasis andcopd as well as cardiomyopathy secondary to cardiac contusionand atrial fibrillation who was transferred for persistenthypoxic respiratory failure after an admission to [hospital ]hospital.the patient's history this year has been marked for startingamioadarone in [month (only) 958] for persistent atrial fibrilllation (alsohad tee and cardioversion) and had stayed in sinus rhythm.unfortunately, in [month (only) ] the patient developed worseningcough and dyspnea and her amiodarone was stopped due to concernfor early pulmonary toxicity.  on [9-23] the patient was admittedto [location (un) ] hospial with worsening respiratory symptoms,including dyspnea, cough, and hypoxia.  she had a chest ct on[9-25] that revealed diffuse ggo on a background ofbronchiectasis and emphysema.  she started empiric treatmentwith abx and steroids for concern of aip.  given progressiverespiratory failure she was intubated.  at the time ofbronchoscopy she had bloody secretions and there was concern forpulmonary hemorrhage.  therefore she was taken offanticoagulation.  she was continued on antibiotics(amp-sublactam and azithromycin) and steroids, heranticoagulation was stopped, and she was also diuresed gently tokeep steadily negative fluid balances.  she had mildimprovements and was extubated on [10-2].  unfortunately, sinceextubation she had progressive supplementary o2 requirements andspent the last few days prior to transfer bouncing between 100%nrb mask and cpap. she has had no positive cultures andbronchoscopy revealed no organisms and no pathognomonic findingsfor a particular diagnosis.  osh course was also notable forpersistent and difficult to control afib with rvr so that ontransfer she was on high doses of diltiazem, metoprolol, anddigoxin.  given her ? pulmonary hemorrhage the patient's primarypulmonologist strongly felt she should not be anticoagulatedagain and wanted transfer partially to pursue av nodal ablationor other more advanced rvr management by our ep service.on arrival, vital signs were 96.1 (axillary), hr 88 (afib),131/65, and satting 95% on non-rebreather. the patient wasawake, alert, responding appropriately to questioning.

differentialdiagnosisincludes drug-related pneumonitis (by report, the patient is onamiodarone), interstitial edema, and interstitial infection.edema is considered less likely given the absence of effusions.bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds [2183-10-11]:impression: bilateral lower extremity dvts, more extensive onthe rightinvolving the common femoral vein, proximal and distalsuperficial femoralveins and posterior tibial and peroneal veins. partiallyocclusive thrombuswithin the distal left superficial femoral vein.brief hospital course: 80 y/o f with likely emphysema and bronchiectasis as well asafib w/ rvr and history of cardiomyopathy presenting withworsening respiratory symptoms and hypoxia in the context ofbilateral ground glass infiltrates of uncertain etiology.hypoxic respiratory failure: the patient presented with veryhigh oxygen requirements and desatting with minimal exertion orvery short periods off the high flow oxygen masks. unclearultimate etiology though diffuse findings on ct were thought tobe concerning for aip on baseline lung disease with pulmonaryhemorrhage thought much less likely given reports of bleeding.patient had already received a fairly high pulse of steroidsleaving the benefit of another course questionable but giventenuous respiratory status limiting ability to perform furtherdiagnostic work-up (particular any attempts to pursue tissuediagnosis) a dose of 1 gram methylprednisolone daily wasinitiated for three days followed by 1 mg/kg daily. she was alsostarted on vancomycin and cefepime given neither vancomycin norpsuedomonas had been covered by here previous antibiotics andthose could be established in her altered airways as a notuncommon cause of pneumonia.  also patient was found to havedvt's as described elsewhere, which were treated in hopes ofhelping hypoxia.  patient received levalbuterol and ipratropriumnebulizers.  eventually a bronchoscopy was done and did not showevidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.  however, the patient'soxygenation became more and more problem[name (ni) 115] and she wasintubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  her ventilatorrequirements continued to escalate.intracranial hemorrage:  while on a heparin drip for dvt, thepatient was noted to have anisocoria.  head ct revealed largeparenchymal hemorrhage apparently centered in the right coronaradiata or that caudate nucleus, with transependymal dissectioninto both lateral ventricles, and the third and fourthventricles.  the patient's  poor prognosis was explained to herfamily.  the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.deep vein thromboses: on presentation given patient's refractoryhypoxia an lack of good options decision was made to pursue somework up for vte given she was thought to be too unstable for ctscan but this could contribute to hypoxia.  lower extremityultrasounds revealed dvt and she was started on heparin gtt.presumably, dvt's were developed during osh course afterwarfarin was stopped.atrial fibrillation: patient was well rate controlled at arrivalon dilt 90 qid, metoprolol tartrate 50 tid and dig, given somepauses (2-2.5 seconds) on the night after
