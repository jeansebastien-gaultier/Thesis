disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .the patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .on 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .the patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on lasix .the patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .a few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .he also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .on 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .the patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .on right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .after 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .past medical history :1. coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 .left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery , saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending artery to diagonal , saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal .2. type 1 diabetes mellitus for 50 years .3. hypercholesterolemia .4. hypertension .5. chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.1 to 1.4 .social history :the patient has a positive tobacco history , but he quit smoking over 20 years ago .he is married and lives in burbank hospital .he has retired .allergies :no known drug allergies .medications on admission :atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. , lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d. , baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , iron sulfate 81 mg p.o. q.d. , lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. , accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. , nph insulin 18 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m. , humalog sliding-scale q.a.m. and q.p.m.physical examination on presentation :the patient had a temperature of 100.9 .he had a blood pressure of 148 to 162/45 to 54 .he had a heart rate of 85 to 87 , breathing at 17 to 23 , satting 100% on room air .in general , he was alert and in no acute distress .his neck was supple without any jugular venous distention .heent examination revealed his pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .his extraocular movements were intact .his sclerae were anicteric .his mucous membranes were moist .his oropharynx was benign .cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm , heart sounds muffled , no murmurs .respiratory revealed bibasilar rales .abdomen was soft , nontender , and nondistended , positive bowel sounds .extremities revealed trace lower extremity edema , right greater than left , 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses .he had 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally .no hematomas were noted , but a soft right femoral bruit was heard .laboratory data on presentation :the patient had a white blood cell count of 9.5 , a hematocrit of 34.5 , a platelet count of 194 .his chem-7 revealed sodium of 132 , potassium of 43 , chloride of 97 , bicarbonate of 28 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 1.3 , glucose of 220 .he had an inr of 1.1 .a calcium of 8.4 , phosphate of 2.5 , magnesium of 1.9 .pericardial fluid analysis was consistent with an exudative etiology .radiology / imaging :the patient had an electrocardiogram with normal sinus rhythm at 70 , normal axis , normal intervals , low voltage in the limb leads .chest x-ray on admission revealed a large left pleural effusion .the patient had an echocardiogram on 11-10 which revealed the following :global left ventricular systolic function appeared grossly preserved .due to technical quality a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded .the aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened .the mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened .there was a large pericardial effusion ( up to greater than 6 cm wide anterior to the right ventricle ).the right ventricle was compressed .hospital course :the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .he was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .he was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .by the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .the patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .the pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .the pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .the patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .we decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .a chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .no evidence of pneumothorax .on the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .he denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .he had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .the patient was without any complaints and remained stable .condition at discharge :condition on discharge was stable .discharge status :the patient was to be discharged to home .discharge diagnoses :1. post pericardiotomy syndrome .2. status post pericardiocentesis .3. status post thoracentesis .4. type 1 diabetes mellitus for 50 years .5. coronary artery disease .6. hypercholesterolemia .7. hypertension .8. chronic renal insufficiency .medications on discharge : ( discharge medications include )1. indomethacin 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. for seven days.2. atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.3. lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.4. baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.5. iron sulfate 81 mg p.o. q.d.6. accupril 40 mg p.o. q.d.7. hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.8. nph insulin 18 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m.9. humalog sliding-scale q.a.m. and q.p.m.discharge followup :the patient was to follow up with his primary cardiologist , dr. thomas , within one week .david archibald , m.d. 11-989dictated by : dorothy y. madore , m.d.medquist36d : 2009-11-12 12:02t
