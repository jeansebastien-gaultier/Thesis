c set was 105; d set was 100. ekgs were withoutchange. as well , the patient had remained symptom-free during thehospital course and was scheduled for a dobutamine mibi for8/10/95 .  the patient on dobutamine mibi study showed heart rategoing up from 70 to 101 , blood pressure 170/80 went up to 230/90.there were no ekg changes and no chest pressure. mibi images werenotable for a fixed mild reduced uptake in the inferior wallconsistent with but not diagnostic for myocardial injury. therewere no reversible perfusion abnormalities detected. as such thepatient was discharged home with a change in her medicationregimen.disposition: discharge medications: atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d. ,ecasa 325 mg q.d. , glucotrol 20 mg b.i.d. ,hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. , trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,axid 150 mg p.o. q.d. , provastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d. follow-up: thepatient is to follow-up with dr. jonker as an outpatient forfurther workup and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease ,as well as following her for her cardiac disease via the riskfactor modification.dictated by: mac mckamie , m.d. pd90attending: ray b. dunwoody , m.d. br50  ao808/6489batch: 61330 index no. leudjz88u9 d: 3/7/96t: 2/18/96[report_end]
