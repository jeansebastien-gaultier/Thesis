breath at rest. on april , 1995 ,she had an echo which showed an ef of 59% , a mildly dilated leftventricle , abnormal septal motion secondary to left bundle branchblock , and minimal mitral regurgitation , and mild mitralcalcification above the normal right ventricular size and function.a bovie study was also performed and was negative. she alsopresented with some biventricular failure and diuresis wasattempted , as well as alkaloid reduction. over the past twomonths , she had increased lower extremity edema , and she gainedapproximately 21 lb since february , 1995. she has been quiteactive and not limited. however , the edema has been her mostlimiting factor. three nights prior to admission , she had dyspneaon exertion and some proximal maximal dyspnea , but she had no

inapril 1995. her cks were flat an troponin i level later documented0.4 , which was negative. echo report also showed some inferiorposterior hypokinesis , as well as significant tricuspidinsufficiency at 3.2 meters per second , which suggested papressures of about 41 mmhg. the patient was subsequently admittedfor management of her congestive heart failure.past medical history: coronary artery

was a rather obese woman ,totally edematous , who was slightly short ofbreath while talking. her vitals were 97.3 , 64 , blood pressure211/100 , respiration rate 20 , and oxygen saturation of 96% on roomair. her neck examination was significant for a jugular venouspulse that went up to the angle of her jaw at 30 degrees. hercarotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally showing no bruits , but there wasa right cea scar. her chest examination was significant for fewcrackles at bilateral bases. cardiac examination showed a normals1 , s2 , but with a faint s3. abdominal examination had a positivefluid wave , positive bowel signs , and she was tender in right upperquadrant. extremities showed 3+ pitting edema to kneesbilaterally. dp pulse was 1+ bilaterally and femoral pulses wereunable to be palpated. her weight , at the time of admission , was233 lb.laboratory data: laboratory values were unremarkable at the timeof admission. ekg showed normal sinus rhythm of64 , left bundle branch block , and there was no change essentiallysince september 1995. chest x-ray , on admission , showed increasedinterstitial markings bilaterally with perhaps a slight pleuraleffusion. there was also some left lower lobe scarring and therewas an elevated left hemidiaphragm , which was consistent withincreased initial pulmonary edema.hospital course: the patient was diuresed with iv lasix for thefirst three hospital days , during which she lostapproximately 17 lb. she was then switched to p.o. lasix onhospital day four , and continued to diurese. she was placed onstrict fluid and diet restrictions
