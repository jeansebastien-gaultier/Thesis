all of which are believed tobe secondary to sepsis.medications on admission: included avapro , lipitor , decadron ,ranitidine , humalog , allopurinol , alimta , flonase , vitamin d ,b12 , and colace.allergies: bactrim , resulting in acute renal failure andhyperkalemic , and penicillin resulting in anaphylaxis.social history: pertinent for the fact that she lives at home.she has a remote history of smoking , quit 15 years ago , anddenies alcohol.family history: pertinent for hypertension , stroke , thyroidcancer , and cervical cancer.findings on admission physical examination: shows a temperatureof 98.9. pulse of 116 , and blood pressure 84/47 , and 96% onventilation. general exam: she is an obese female , intubatedand awake , motioning to take her tube out. skin exam showedscattered group petechial areas over the torso , abdomen , andunder the right breast. heent exam shows pupils equal , round ,and reactive and anicteric , with a normal jvp. pulmonary examshows decreased mildly decreased breath sounds at the right base.no crackles , increase in expiratory phase , few scattered rales.cardiac exam shows tachycardia otherwise regular rhythm. a 2/6systolic murmur across precordium. abdomen is soft , obese ,positive bowel sounds , nontender , and nondistended with chronicskin changes below the pannus. extremities show trace to 1+edema to the shins , with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.neurologic , the patient is awake; however , the exam is otherwisedifficult to perform secondary to the patient being intubated.pertinent labs on admission: show a white count of 0.74 with 46%polys and 6% bands , resulting in an absolute neutrophil count of340 , a hematocrit of 26.2 , and platelets of 37. creatinine of3.1 , a ptt of 83.5 and inr of 1.4 , and lactic acid of 1.4.chest x-ray on admission shows right infrahilar mass , bibasilaropacities , with chronic alveolar disease versus new fusions , icannot rule out infiltrate. abdominal ct shows small bowel wallthickening and left-sided atelectasis versus pneumonia.procedures: status post intubation and extubation.hospital course by problems:1. infectious disease: ms. dozois was admitted with fever andhypertension , and i was concerned for sepsis , i initially thoughtnosocomial pneumonia versus gi as the primary source. sherequired intubation and pressors , and was started on vancomycin ,levaquin , and aztreonam along with flagyl empirically. her urinegrew enterococcus and she was changed to levaquin only on10/25/2005 to treat an enterococcal uti and possible nosocomialpneumonia. an abdominal ct was obtained , which shows small bowelwall thickening and injection of the sma territory concerning fora neutropenic enteritis. surgery was consulted and she wasmanaged conservatively with antibiotics initially and then withbowel rest. she is no longer neutropenic and was off neupogenover a week prior to discharge. she was afebrile over the lastweek and will stay and finish the 14-day course of levaquin foruti.2. gi: ms. lorts was treated with bowel rest for her neutropenicenteritis and once she was no longer neutropenic withoutabdominal pain , she was started on clear liquid diet. however ,she developed intermittent gi bleed , secondary to likelysloughing of her mucosa status post neutropenic enteritis. giwas consulted and she was again placed on bowel rest. though ,she has a history of colonic polyps , gi also felt that theculprit of her gi bleed is mucosal sloughing as well. shecontinued to have intermittent episodes of bloody diarrheawhenever she was re challenged with p.o. intake. her c-diff isnegative. colonoscopy was deferred secondary tothrombocytopenia. she required multiple red blood transfusionsto maintain her hematocrit greater than 26 , though she was neverhemodynamically unstable. finally , after given sustained bowelrest , her blood stools resolved , and she was able to tolerateoral contrast and an abdominal ct on 6/30/2005 showed no smallbowel wall thickening or any other intraabdominal process causingher symptoms. her diet was advanced , and she was toleratingregular diet at the time of discharge without problems.3. copd: on home o2 , typically requiring 2 liters with baselinesat over 90s. ms. shubrick was intubated on admission for increasedshortness of breath and hypoxia. she was extubated the followingday on 4/16/2005 .  she requires bipap nightly , now stable on 2to 4 liters nasal cannula during the day.4. heme: on chemotherapy induced anemia with hematocrit drop onadmission to 21 from the baseline of around 26. she respondedwell initially to three units of packed red blood cells over7/28/2005 and 09 .  however , in the setting of her gibleed from a sloughing mucosa secondary to resolving neutropenicenteritis and recent chemo , she required multiple further rbctransfusions to keep her hematocrit greater than 30. she wasalso thrombocytopenic , status post chemo and required multipleplatelet transfusions to keep her platelets greater than 30 , 000.hematology was consulted secondary to suboptimal busted plateletlevels status post transfusions , which was felt to be secondaryto poor marrow response in the setting of recent chemo ( workupwas negative for other possible causes refractorythrombocytopenia , nystatin , allopurinol , were held given possibleworsening of her thrombocytopenia ). on discharge her hematocritand platelets were stable respectively at 29.8 and 46 , 000 and shehad not required a transfusion in greater than 24 hours prior todischarge.5. acute on chronic renal failure: the patient's baselinecreatine is 1.7; however , on admission it was noted to be 3 ,likely secondary to hypovolemia from vomiting and diarrhea ( fenawas 0.22% ). her creatinine is now back to baseline withhydration. her creatinine was 1.1 prior to discharge.6. nonsmall cell lung cancer: the patient is on alimta startedfor her neutropenia , which has since resolved. she will followwith her oncologist dr. ervin tonrey for further therapy.7. endocrine: because of her insulin-dependent diabetes , thepatient was placed on portland protocol while on the stress dose.steroids were discontinued on 10/25/2005 and she passed acortisol stimulation test on 10/25/2005 as well. she was changedto standing insulin on 10/25/2005 and her lantus was up titratedalong with sliding scale insulin to maintain blood sugars in the80s to 120s. she will return home on her home regimen.8. fen: tpn was started on 4/21/2005 , given her bowel rest forpossible neutropenic enteritis. she restarted p.o. intake on9/2/2005 and tolerated advancement to diabetic diet , and shewas weaned off her tpn prior to discharge.consultants: general surgery , hematology , and gastroenterology.physical examination at discharge: vital signs: t max 98 , bloodpressure 120/60 , pulse 88 , and respirations 20 sating at 95% on3.5 liters of oxygen. general exam shows an obese female restingand in no acute distress. nasal cannula in place. heent examwas normocephalic , atraumatic. pulmonary exam showed decreasedair entry , decreased breath sounds , but otherwise no obviouswheezes or rhonchi. cardiovascular exam shows regular rate andrhythm , no murmurs , rubs , or gallops , but decreased heart sounds.abdominal exam shows an obese abdomen , nontender , nondistended ,positive bowel sounds. extremities show 1 to 2+ edemabilaterally to the knee. skin exam shows a area where leftinternal jugular line was removed and the site is intact anddressed. improved erythema in her intertriginous areas.neurologic exam shows the patient is alert and oriented x3without any focal neurologic deficits.the patient was discharged in stable condition and she willfollow up with dr. marco derosset in one week.the patient is full code.discharge medications: tylenol 650 to 1000 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n.pain , headache , if fever is greater than 101 , peridex mouth wash10 ml twice a day , nystatin mouth wash 10 ml swish and swallow 4x day as needed , oxycodone 5 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n. pain ,simethicone 80 mg p.o. q.i.d. p.r.n. gaseousness , trazodone 25 mgp.o. at bedtime , miconazole nitrate 2% powder topical b.i.d. toareas between skin folds including under the right breast , nexium20 mg p.o. daily , lantus 30 mg subcutaneous daily , duoneb 3/0.5mg nebs q. 3 h. p.r.n. shortness of breath , aspart 4 units beforeeach meal subcutaneously , folate 3 mg p.o. daily , avapro 150 mgp.o. daily , meclizine 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , combivent 2 puffsinhaled q.i.d. , vitamin d 125 0.25 mcg p.o. daily.escription document: 5-0185679 affocusdictated by: spahn , lelandattending: scheuring , willy lymandictation id 2453716d: 6/13/05t: 10/30/05[report_end]
