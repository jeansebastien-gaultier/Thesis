[known lastname 77651] is a 47 y/o female with a h/o schizophrenia,bipolar, dm, and hypothyroidism who presented to [hospital1 18] withaltered mental status and tremulous and was found to havelithium toxicity, [last name (un) ], and streptococcus viridans in bacteremia.acute issues:# lithium toxicity: the patient was found to ahve a lithiumlevel of 3.0 on arrival. it is unlikely that this represents anoverdose as patient has been an inpatient at a psychiatrichospital. she has only been on lithium for approximately 1 week.it is likely that patient sustained an acute kidney injury overthe course of the past few weeks, causing decreased renallithium clearance, resulting in toxicicty. toxicology and renalwere consulted. temporary femoral hd line was placed, and shewas dialyzed x 1 session. lithium level was checked 6 hoursafter dialysis and was 1.0, re-check was 1.2, then came down to0.9 as uop picked up. her lithium level decreased again to 0.7and then to < 0.2.# acute renal failure: the patient was found to have a cr of 3.3on presentation (baseline was 0.8 on [2138-7-18]). this was likelypre-renal [12-26] poor po intake over past few weeks. she received2l boluses of ns and had maintenance fluids of ns at 200-250cc.her uop increased significantly with aggressive hydration andher creatinine returned to her baseline of 0.8.# streptococcus viridans bacteremia: the patient was found tohave strep viridans present in [11-25] bottles. the patient wasinitially started on vancomycin and it was thought that the grampositive cocci represented a contamination. upon speciation ofstrep viridans, infectious disease was consulted. theyconsidered this a low risk bacteremia and recommended 14 days ofceftriaxone 2 g iv daily from negative cultures. repeat cultureson [2138-7-30] were with no growth. the temporary hemodialysiscatheter tip was sent for culture on [7-31] and was with no growth.a midline was placed on [2138-8-2] for antibiotic administration andantibiotics will be completed on [2138-8-14].# ams/psychosis: improved somewhat after dialysis andnormalization of lithium level. agitation was generally wellcontrolled with prn ativan. continued to be agitated andresponding to internal stimuli. her antipsychotics wereinitially held in setting of acute lithium toxicity due toincreased risk of nms. psych was consulted and followed patient.they recommended re-starting her aripiprazole and it was slowlytitrated back to home dose of 30 mg daily. she was discharged toinpatient psych bed on [hospital1 ] 4.chronic:# schizophrenia/bioplar: psych was consulted and followedpatient. initially all psych meds were held in the setting ofacute lithium toxicity. her aripriprazole was started back andslowly titrated back to home dose. the remainder of psych medswere held. she was discharged to inpatient psych bed on [hospital1 ] 4.#dm2: the patient's home metformin was held duringhospitalization and she was maintained on insulin sliding scale.#hypothyroidism: the patient's tsh was within normal limits. herhome synthroid was continued during hospitalization and cytomelwill be restarted upon discharge.transitional issues:-will need to complete 14 day course of ceftriaxone with 9/6conuted as day 1 (to be completed on [8-14]).-psychiatry to continue titrating and adjust psychiatricmedicaitons.-patient will need to restart metformin when not refusing toeat.- patient will need panorex and/or dental eval for multiplecaries when acute psychosis improves as possible source for herbacteremiamedications on admission:preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.information was obtained from  [hospital1 1680]-hri.1. aripiprazole 30 mg po daily2. bupropion (sustained release) 200 mg po bid3. benztropine mesylate 1 mg po bid4. bisacodyl 5 mg po daily5. cytomel 10 mcg po daily6. chloral hydrate 500 mg po qhs7. clonazepam 1 mg po q4h:prn anxiety8. clonazepam 0.5 mg po bid9. haloperidol 10 mg po bid10. lithium carbonate 300 mg po qhs11. metformin (glucophage) 500 mg po daily12. ibuprofen 400 mg po q6h:prn pain13. omeprazole 20 mg po q 12h14. prazosin 1 mg po hs15. levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po daily16. vitamin d 1000 unit po dailydischarge medications:1. aripiprazole 30 mg po daily2. ibuprofen 400 mg po q6h:prn pain3. levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg po daily4. ceftriaxone 2 gm iv q24h5. bisacodyl 5 mg po daily6. cytomel 10 mcg po daily7. omeprazole 20 mg po q 12h8. vitamin d 1000 unit po dailydischarge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital1 ] 4discharge diagnosis:primary diagnosis:lithium toxicitystreptococcs viridans bacteremiasecondary diagnosis:schizophreniabipolardischarge condition:mental status: confused - always.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: currently refusing to get out of bed,previously ambulatory.discharge instructions:ms.
