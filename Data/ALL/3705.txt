plan: 66 yo m w/ likely new onset chf.  given his exam, i would favor systolic heart failure &gt; diastolic heart failure, although he has features going for both.  features going for systolic are his widely displaced pmi and the fact that he had a mildly dilated lv on an echo in 2092.i think he most likely has dilated cardiomyopathy 2/2 mitral regurgitation, which was moderate to severe in 2092.  his murmur is quite impressive.  another possibility is alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  ischemia is not out of the question given his age and risk factors. he is also a smoker.  another possibility is diastolic failure given his hypertension and likely diabetes.1.        chf &#8211; still quite volume overloaded on exam.  will give another dose of lasix 40 iv tonight.  start captopril 6.25 q8 to also control bp.  repeat echo in the am.  strict i/os, fluid restriction, low fat, low salt diet.  if ef is depressed, will start beta blocker, consider aldactone.2.        substance abuse &#8211;
