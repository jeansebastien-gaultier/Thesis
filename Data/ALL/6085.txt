induced from narcotics(received vicodin for pain control) but urine toxicology screenalso positive for methadone, and abg showed an acute respiratoryacidosis concerning for respiratory depression. toxicologyscreen negative at osh for etoh, apap, and asa. no evidence ofnew ich or stroke on head ct. no evidence of uti on urineanalysis. cardiac etiology was ruled out with cardiac enzymesnegative x 2. patient was extubated with good mental status butsubsequently became increasingly altered, thought to beassociated with morphine use for pain control. this deliriumresolved upon avoiding opioid
