which has been held since [2112-6-14] in setting ofmultiple admission to osh for melanotic stools, pvd s/p multiplelower extremity revascularization, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,presenting with upper gib confirmed on egd during this admission# upper gi bleed, gastric ulcerspatient presented reporting signs and symptoms of upper gib withmelanotic stool and hematemsis and was supported by significantbun/cr dissociation. the patient underwent egd which showedmultiple ulcers in the stomach with evidence of recent bleed.she was transfused 3 u prbcs during the admission- two in the edand one in the micu, and put on iv ppi and sucralfate.  patientwas hemodynamically stable throughout with and hematocrits heldaround 30.#vap/hypoxiashe developed a fever in the micu,  and given that it was 24 hrsafter intubtation with question of an infiltrate on cxr, she wasstarted on cefepime and vancomycin which she received for 24hrs.  these meds were d/ced on the floor as repeat cxr did notshow good evidence of pneumonia and she did not look clinicallyinfected. she was treated empirically with vancomycin 75 mg q 12and cefepime 1 g q 12 hr.  a repeat cxr pa and lateral wasobtained which was not impressive for an infiltrate- the patientremained asymptomatic and afebrile so the abx were discontinuedat 24 hrs.  however, on exam the patient was noted to havecrackles about halfway up on both lung fields.  she was given aone time iv dose of lasix and restarted on her home regimen.her oxygen requirements were optimized by the time of dischargeand she was on her home lasix regimen.#drug-induced pancytopeniapatient has had thrombocytopenia on past labs of uncertainetiology.  she was noted to have downtrending wbcs to 1.6 by [10-15]and was technically still anemic.  a smear noted some occasionalschistocytes but hemolysis labs were negative.  hematology wasconsulted and thought the vancomycin or cefepime was causingmarrow toxicity.  she was monitored for the next few days untilher counts began to increase.  they went up to wbc 2.6 21%neutrophils (anc still below 1000).  per heme recs she was given1 dose of neupogen.  her cbc then increased to wbc 7.1 withalmost 70% neutrophils.  she was discharged with close follow upwith her hematologist.her cbc was closely monitored during herhospital stay.# hypertensionthe patient's home blood pressure medications were held whenadmitted to the icu for concern of gib.  she actually becamehypertensive during this time.  upon arrival to the floor herhome bp meds were restarted as below.  she remained stable,although with an episode of overnight hypertension 2 days priorto discharge.- diovan 320 mg po qd- labetalol 100 mg po tid- nidefipine er 60 mg po qd#pvd: patient was originally scheduled to have a revision of aprevious vascular surgery during the time frame of heradmission.  this was obviously postponed, but the issue of heranticoagulation remained.  she had a prior dvt which she takeswarfarin for but this has been held since [month (only) 116] due to recurrentgi bleeds.  the vascular surgery team expressed they would likeher anticoagulated for her pvd.  after consulting with both giand vascular it was decided that she could go out on plavix, andhold aspirin given her risk of rethrombosis in her vascularstents combined with the stability of the bleed.# acute renal insufficiencypatient has baseline cr ~ 0.7 with admission cr 1, which camedown to 0.9- no issues since admissionchronic issues# chronic back pain- continued tramadol prn# hyperlipidemia- continued

given 2 units of blood in theemergency department and then transferred to the icu and given 1unit of blood.  the gastroenterologists took you down for anendoscopy which showed a recently bleeding ulcer- they tookbiopsies of it which showed inflammation- there was no otherintervention performed.  you were briefly given antibiotics forpneumonia but were taken off after 24 hrs treatment.  your wbcswere noted to be abnormally low and a hematology consult wasobtained.  it was thought that either the vancomycin or cefepimecaused your low blood counts.  we watched them for a few daysand they struggled to increase.  you received one dose ofneupogen, which helps stimulate the bone marrow, and werecleared for discharge as your wbc increased to 7.1 with almost60% neutrophils.the following
