a lithium level of 2.0.  glucose was 215 (she has hadepisodes of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic episodes in the past).toxicology was consulted, recommending dialysis due to hersymptoms.  nephrology recommended aggressive hydration first,and regardless, the patient refused to have dialysis or foleycatheters placed.  she received 3 l ns in the ed with markedimprovements in her symptoms, although she did not return tobaseline.  she was admitted to the micu for monitoring andaggressive diuresis.upon arrival, her vitals were t 36.4, hr 66, bp 154/69, rr 19,sat 99% ra.  she was comfortable and in

year-old woman with a history ofinsulin-dependent dmii, bipolar disorder, and psoriaticarthritis who presents with altered mental status, acute kidneyinjury, and elevated lithium levels.# altered mental status: altered mental status most likely causeby lithium toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury. noevidence of infection on ua, no fever or leukocytosis. she has ahistory of ams with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states, but herhyperglycemia was relatively mild and her serum osmolarity wasnormal.  toxicology initially recommended dialysis, butnephrology recommended trying aggressive diuresis beforedialyzing the patient, who said that she would refuse a dialysiscatheter. lithium was held, [known lastname ] was held and she washydrated agressively with lr, since patient has received 6 l nsand developed a hyperchloremic acidosis. lithium levels werechecked q6hours and she was discharged when lithium levelsreturned to [location 213]# acute kidney injury: her creatinine was elevated to 1.3 from abaseline of 0.7 on admission.  this was thought to be mostlikely intrinsic from tmp/smx usage, but there she may have hadprerenal physiology as well due to decreased po intake.  therewas no evidence of obstruction or infection. [location ] and[location ] were held, she was hydrated and electrolytes werefollowed.# diabetes mellitus: chronic issue which was stable duringadmission. she was kept on her sliding scale insulin, metforminwas held. she refused to take her long acting insulin# psoriatic arthritis: symptoms were stable.  she can continuetaking her methotrexate and enbrel as an outpatient# hypothyroidism: chronic, stable. continued home levothyroxine.# bipolar and anxiety disorders: chronic, stable.  she has nomood symptoms and her altered mental status is not at allconsistent with mania or depression.  we continued her homebenzodiazepines and held lithium in the setting of acutetoxicity.# anemia: initial hematocrit was normal, but that may be in thesetting of hemoconcentration.  no evidence of acute bleeding.stool guiac was negative and serial crits were stable.transitional issues:- she was told to hold her [location ]. restarting should bedecided by outpatient physician[name initial (pre) ] [name10 (nameis) ] may have increased her lithium level in setting of[last name (un) ].
