:signeddischarge date :            12/08/1997discharge diagnosis :perforated appendicitis and appendiceal abscess .secondary diagnosis was none .history of present illness :the patient is a 31 year old white female who presented to the emergency department at the ver medical center with a chief complaint of diffuse abdominal pain which was periumbilical in origin .patient had experienced periumbilical pain which was nonradiating , mild , and stable for approximately three days .in addition , she had had three days of nausea and vomiting .she complained of no dysuria and no vaginal or urinary discharge .her last meal was on the day of admission .her last bowel movement was two days prior to admission and her last menstrual period was on november 6 , 1997 .patient did note some slight anorexia .past medical / surgical history :unremarkable .current medications :she took no medications .allergies :she had no known drug allergies .physical examination :she had a temperature of 100.1 degrees fahrenheit , heart rate 115 , and blood pressure 139/89 .heent :oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , and pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .chest :lungs were clear to auscultation .heart :regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .abdomen :positive bowel sounds , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , no costovertebral angle tenderness , no hernia , and no rebound or guarding .there was mild right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant tenderness and no masses palpable .rectal :nontender and hemoccult negative .pelvic :examination showed no masses and mild cervical motion tenderness .extremities :no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .neurological :no focal deficits .laboratory examination :studies revealed that chemistries were within normal limits , white blood cell count was 20.8000 , hematocrit was 38 , and platelets were 272,000 .kub was performed in the emergency room which showed dilated loops of small bowel with no air fluid levels .in addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .the pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .chest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta hcg was negative .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .she was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic ct scan .on the day of admission , an abdominopelvic cat scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .the colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .this was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .there were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .the primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .a delayed ct scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed ct scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .at this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .the patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , gentamicin , and flagyl , kept npo , and serial examinations were obtained .over the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .patient 's physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .after the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .repeat cat scan was obtained on hospital day five .this cat scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .the appendix was not well visualized .the repeat ct scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .these were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .given the progression of the patient 's cat scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .patient 's bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of golytely .she experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .on december 3 , 1997 , the patient was taken to the operating room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by dr. zamorryn he .no ileocecectomy was performed .cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .these peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew e. coli and coagulase negative staphylococcus .the patient 's perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , gentamicin , and flagyl ) were continued .the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room then subsequently to the floor .pain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .patient 's nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .on postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .her abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .she had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .two jackson-pratts were placed intraoperatively .at the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the jackson-pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .the patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on december 8 , 1997 .her jackson-pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which includes an additional nine days of antibiotics with the patient 's operative date being considered day one of antibiotics .disposition :disposition is home without services .discharge medications :ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. , flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.3-4h. p.r.n. pain .condition on discharge :stable .follow-up :patient should follow-up with the an general medical center with dr. zamorryn hanty he , he should call for an appointment within one week of discharge
