chest painhpi: mr bickford is a 65 year old with a past medical history ofhypertension , cocaine/etoh abuse , rheumatic heart disease with ai/mr , whopresents with chest pain from rehab 12 hours after discharge from 9 dayadmission. his chest pain is identical to prior episodes occurring duringhis previous admission. he originally presented with 2-3 weeks ofgeneralized weakness with intermittent chest pain and was diagnosed withsevere polymyositis ( ck up to 33 , 000 ) during last admission. he was givenivf+bicarb for renal protection from myoglobinuria and became volumeoverloaded , with successful diuresis to euvolemia by the time ofdischarge. he had intermittent cp occurring at night , described asnonradiating over left chest associated with sob. he had persistentlyelevated troponin with no ischemic changes on ekg , and his cp was felt tobe due to myocarditis. he was treated with asa , labetalol , isordil ,ccb , and ativan with improvement. he was started on iv solumedrolwith immediate significant improvement in ck ( down to 10 , 000 ) andtroponin ( 0.64 ). during his 12 hour stay at rehab , he developed cpwith sob occurring at night. he was then readmitted to th for cardiaccatheterization and further care.pmh: cocaine , etoh abuse ( s/p ativan taper last admission ) , htn ,colonic tubular adenoma , ms , aipre-admission medication list for biancuzzo , wayne

by problem:1. chest pain and shortness of breath. he was re-admitted for nocturnalchest pain while at rehab , and concern for myocardial ischemia. heunderwent cardiac catheterization that showed normal coronary anatomy ,suggesting that the elevated ck-mb and troponin were likely frommyocarditis , as previously suspected. notably , his chest pain was oftenassociated with shortness of breath. it was noted on his prior admissionthat he had pleural effusions from the high volume diuresis intended toprotect his kidneys from myoglobin toxicity , however he had been diuresingwell to lasix. it was thought that his cp and sob might be due to pnd givenhis valvular disease. consequently , his vasoldilatory medications wereswitched to evening dosing , his lasix dose increased , and the head of bedkept elevated at greater than thirty degrees. on the day after admission , hehad one episode of chest pain with shortness of breath , where he indicatedpain in his ruq. a kub was negative , as was a pe protocol ct , and heresponded very well to lasix. he had one further episode of sob at night ,again responsive to lasix and position. he had a repeat echo that showedno progression of his valvular disease from prior admission and equivalentef of 70-75%. he was maintained on aspirin , labetalol , diltiazem , imdur , andativan prn.2. arrhythmias. he was on rate control with calcium channel blockers.he had several noctural few beat runs of nsvt , but no other significantevents.3. rhabdo: he has severe polymyositis causing muscle weakness and elevatedck , with possible contribution from cocaine. so far , the remaining work uphas been negative. preliminary biopx sy shows muscle necrosis andchronic inflammation along with features reminiscent of dermatomyositis. hewas changed back to iv solumedrol on admission , and switched to po solumedrolon discharge. his ck dropped from 15 , 000 on this admission to 10 , 000 , andthen hovered around that dose. rheumatology consult fellow gavin nordman feltthis was a normal pattern under treatment , and that the true extent ofrecovery/impairment will only be known in several weeks to months.diagnosis.4. renal. his cr was maintained at 1.3-1.5 over the course of his admission ,likely related to both renal damage from myoglobinuria and possibly fromover-diureses and pre-renal phsyiology , especially in the context of bun of42. his lasix dose , initially increased on admission due to excellentsymptomatic response with diuresis , was in the process of slow tapering atthe time of discharge in attempt to identify the appropriate outpatientdosing , with goal of maximizing symptomatic resopnse and minimizing prerenalphysiology.5. full codeadditional comments: mr water you were admitted for chest pain , and it was determined bylooking at the anatomy of the vessels supplying your heart that you havenot had a heart attack caused by diminished blood flow to the heart. youdo , however , have an inflammatory condition in which your immune systemattacks and breaks down your muscle. as you know , the recovery processwill be long , and you will need to take medication for it for at leastfour to eight weeks. your rheumatologist , dr zoelle , will coordinate yourmedication and care. you have an appointment with her in two weeks.also , you have disease afflicting the valves of your heart , and you willneed to see a cardiologist. you have an appointment with dr kissi for thisissue. in addition , you have an appointment with your new primary carephysician , dr holverson . please attend all of these appointments , and besure to take all your medications as prescribed. lastly , it cannot beemphasized enough that your health depends on the care you take ofyourself , making sure to stop smoking ,

condition: stableto do/plan:1. myositis. please follow ck , may need additional agent in the long term.per rheumatology , response may take weeks.2. chest pain. his pain is not of ischemic origin. he does have rheumaticheart disease , and appears to have pnd with pain and shortness of breaththat is responsive to lasix , position , and oxygen.3. lasix dosing. he will need to be tapered on lasix , with attempt toidentify the proper dose for symptomatic relief while not making himpre-renal.no dictated summaryentered by: wadding , kieth l. , m.d.
