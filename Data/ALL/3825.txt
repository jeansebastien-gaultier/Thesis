contrast materialas above.2. embolization of the left l3 lumbar artery per surgical teamrequest.brief hospital course:1. dyspnea:  she was admitted w/ dyspnea in setting of urisymptoms that was most consistent w/ viral uri, as there was nofever and no infiltrative process on chest ct.  she was testedfor influenza w/ dfa of nasal aspirate.  meanwhile, she wastreated w/ ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible cap.on hd#2, dfa returned as positive for influenza a.  as the pthad been afebrile w/ no signs of infxn, pneumonia was thought tobe unlikely and abx were d/c at that time.  she remained dyspnicw/ upper and lower airway wheezing throughout her early hospitalcourse, which was thought to be [2-6] viral bronchitis.  she wastreated w/ prednisone taper and nebulized albuterol andatrovent, w/ good symptom control.  however, she requiredcontinued o2 by nc to maintain o2 sats >93% throughout the firsthalf of her admission.  by d/c, she was weaned off o2 and wasbreathing comfortably on room air without requirement foralbuterol or atrovent.  at d/c, she is maintaining good o2 saton room air and is not dyspnic.2. gi bleed:  she was observed to have melanic stool in the ed,without any gi symptoms.  she was guaiac positive at that time.this was most likely [2-6] indolent upper gi bleed.  on admission,coumadin was held and heparin was started for anticoagulationgiven her avr.  treatment was started w/ iv protonix.  planswere made for egd/colonoscopy to evaluate for source ofbleeding, but these procedures were delayed due to the pt'sdyspnea and relative risk of sedation.  her hct was observed todrop significantly, which was likely [2-6] retroperitoneal bleedas below, and not related to gi bleed.  after her admission, shehad no further melena or hematochezia.  after stabilization ofretroperitoneal bleed, she underwent egd and colonoscopy, whichdemonstrated evidence of esophagitis w/ no active bleeding.protonix was changed to oral formulation, and sucralfate wasadded for improved treatment of esophagitis.  she had no furtherevidence of active gi bleeding during her admission.  hersucralfate was stopped. she will need to continue protonix twicedaily after d/c.3. retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  on hd#4, her hct was observed tohave dropped overnight from 27 to 21.  this was concerning foractive gi bleed.  she was transfused w/ 2units prbcs, w/appropriate hct increase to 29 after transfusion.  however, herhct again decreased overnight from 29 to 22 with no melena orhematochezia to explain the blood loss.  lab workup showed noevidence of hemolysis.  abd ct demonstrated large leftretroperitoneal hemorrhage, 11x5 cm in size, w/ radiographicevidence of acute on chronic bleeding.  heparin was d/c, she wastransfused w/ an additional 2units prbcs, and was transferred tothe micu for close monitoring.  surgery was consulted, andrecommended holding anticoagulation with close monitoring ofhct.  the pt had appropriate response of hct w/ prbctransfusion, and hct remained stable for 3 days offanticoagulation.  as hct had stabilized, she was transferredback to the medicine floor and surgery recommended resumingheparin for anticoagulation.  heparin was resumed w/ closemonitoring of ptt, and hct was monitored closely.  however,after resuming heparin the pt had another decrease in hctconcerning for active bleeding.  heparin was stoppedimmediately.  repeat ct scan showed enlarging leftretroperitoneal bleed tracking down into pelvis and left thigh.cta was done to localize source of bleed, and showed activecontrast extravasation from the left l3 lumbar artery.  ir wasconsulted, and performed embolization of left l3 lumbar artery,though there was no evidence of active bleeding from the arteryat the time of the procedure.  she tolerated the procedure well. hct was follow closely after embolization, and remained stablefor 3 days.  repeat cta showed no active bleeding from the l3lumbar artery, which indicated a successful embolization.  giventhis confirmation and stable hct, heparin was resumed w/ initialgoal ptt of 40.  hct was stable on this level of heparin, soheparin was increased to goal ptt of 60-70.  the pt received 1dose of coumadin 5mg to begin long-term anticoagulation.  a pttof 60 was achieved and was stable for 12 hours w/ stable hct,but the pt then developed abdominal distention and pain, w/significant llq/luq tenderness on exam.  this was concerning foradditional bleeding.  heparin was once again d/c, and repeat ctshowed markedly enlarged retroperitoneal bleed displacing theleft kidney and bowels to the right abdomen.  surgery, ir, andvascular surgery were all consulted for recommendations on howto stop her bleeding.  the consulting services all agreed thatintervention was ill-advised, as surgical treatment was ofteninneffective and repeated arterial embolization in this settingmight result in embolization of the wrong vessel, w/ possiblebowel infarction or other complication.  thus, the pt was given2units ffp to reverse her inr of 1.3, and was transfused w/2units of prbcs.  her hct did not respond appropriately to prbctransfusion, so she was transferred to the micu for closemonitoring and continued transfusion.  while in micu,anticoagulation continued to be held, and patient remainedstable during micu course.  indeed, it was felt that risks ofbleeding outweighed need to anti-coagulation benefits. thepatient was transferred to the floor with no further episodes ofbleeding and a stable hematocrit for >72 hours by discharge.4. htn:  bp was acceptable on admission.  bp meds were heldinitially given concern for gi bleed and subsequentretroperitoneal hemorrhage.  however, bp was elevated within afew days of admission.  when retroperitoneal bleed had initiallystabilized, her outpt meds were resumed including diovan, hctz,and clonidine, resulting in good bp control.  when herhematocrit began to drop for a second time and the patient wastransferred back to the micu, her antihypertensives were againheld. as her bleed stabilized, her blood pressures trendedupward and she was restarted on diovan at 1/2 her home dose. herblood pressures should be followed at rehab.5. anemia:  she has h/o iron deficiency anemia, w/ prior egdshowing gastritis.  hct on admission was slightly below baselineof 32-33.  hct remained stable for initial hospital days, butdropped w/ retroperitoneal bleed as above.  her hct was labilethroughout her admission [2-6] intermittent bleeding. at d/c,there is no evidence of active bleeding.  she will require f/uof hct after d/c to watch for further bleeding.6. hypothyroidism:  stable on synthroid during her admission.7. avr:  she has st. [male first name (un) 1525] artificial aortic valve; requiresanticoagulation w/ goal inr 2.5-3.5.  inr subtherapeutic onadmission.  given melanic stool, we held coumadin on admissionand started heparin for anticoagulation.  she had intermittentretroperitoneal bleeding during her admission, requiring d/c andresumption of heparin multiple times as above.  given herrepeated spontaneous bleeding after embolization of l3 lumberartery, we do not want to restart anticoagulation in the nearfuture as the risk of ongoing bleeding is too great.8. mediastinal lad:  she has mediastinal lad, w/ largest node 3x 2 cm by ct.  this may represent lung ca given pulm nodule andsmoking history.  however, the pt wishes to defer furtherevaluation until active issues resolved.  will follow w/ repeatct 2 months after d/c.9. cystitis:  she developed cystitis from yeast while usingfoley catheter, likely [2-6] [female first name (un) 564], as supported by pyuria andyeast in ucx.  foley catheter was changed on discovery of yeastin urine, and she was treated w/ 7 day course of fluconazole.at d/c, there is no evidence of active infection.medications on admission:1. coumadin 6mg 6 days per week, 7mg 1 day per week2. diovan 160mg qam3. hctz 12.5mg q day4. prevacid5. synthroid 175mcg q day6. clonidine 0.1mg [hospital1 ]discharge medications:1. levothyroxine sodium 175 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet podaily (daily).2. zolpidem tartrate 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (atbedtime) as needed.3. valsartan 80 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po daily(daily).disp:30 capsule(s) refills:24. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever and pain.5. pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig:one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12 hours).6. simethicone 80 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet,chewable po qid (4 times a day).7. lidocaine hcl 2 % gel sig: one (1) appl urethral q4-6 prn ()as needed for rectal discomfort.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital3 2558] - [location (un) ]discharge diagnosis:primary:1. retroperitoneal bleed.2. influenza a3. mediastinal lymphadenopathy.4. 4 mm nodule within the left upper lobe laterally with hazyspiculated margins.5. bronchiectasis.6. hiatal hernia.7. gi bleed.secondary/pmh:1. ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm s/p valve conduitreplacement with st.
