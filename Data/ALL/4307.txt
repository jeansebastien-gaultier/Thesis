medical history above .review of systems :otherwise negative .physical examination :vital signs :heart rate 62 , respiratory rate 16 , blood pressure right arm 205/84 , oxygen saturation 97% on two liters nasal cannula .general :she was in no apparent distress , tired , easily arousable older female .heent examination demonstrated that the pupils were equal , round and reactive to light .extraocular movements were intact .there was a left cataract on the fundoscopic examination .neck was supple , bilateral bruits , although possibly radiating from cardiac base .there was no jugular venous distension .chest demonstrated bilateral holosystolic bruits over the subclavians , left greater than right with few bibasilar crackles .cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 cresendo / descrecendo murmur heard best at the apex with preservation of the second heart sound , no s3 or s4 .abdominal examination was soft , non-tender , non-distended , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no abdominal tenderness .however , there were bilateral bilateral renal bruits and femoral bruits .the patient was guaiac negative per the emergency room .extremities demonstrated no edema .extremity pulses revealed a right radial of 2+ , left radial of 1+ , 2+ distal pulses in the lower extremities bilaterally .lower extremity blood pressures demonstrated systolics of 205-210 .laboratory :laboratory values on admission included a sodium of 142 , potassium 4.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 27 , bun and creatinine of 39 and 1.6 respectively , glucose 113 .calcium was 9.6 .ck was 62 .troponin was 0.2 .white blood cell count was 11.5 , 85 polys , 5 bands , hematocrit 37.6 , platelet count 328 .coagulation studies were 11.3/25.5/0.9 .urinalysis demonstrated trace leukocyte esterase , 5-10 white blood cells and 1+ squamous epithelial cells .ekg demonstrated normal sinus rhythm , rate of 73 , borderline left atrial enlargement , axis of-28 , t-wave inversions in v4 through v6 , i and avl , borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with strain compared to earlier this am .there appeared to be a new t-wave inversion in v4 .medications on admission :1 ) aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day .2 ) os-cal 1250 mg p.o. three times a day .3 ) lasix 40 mg p.o. q.o.d.4 ) plaquenil 200 mg p.o. q. day .5 ) ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.6 ) levoxyl 100 mg p.o. q. day .7 ) arava 20 mg p.o. q. day .8 ) zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.9 ) isosorbide dinitrate unclear dose .10 ) diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q. day .11 ) epogen q. two weeks .social history :negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .the patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .hospital course :1 ) cardiovascular :the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix .the patient 's diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .at this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .2 ) neurological / vascular :the discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra .mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .the results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .3 ) orthopedic :the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance .a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker .plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .4 ) gastrointestinal :the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .the patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .the etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .an attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued .5 ) infectious disease :the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 .urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .the patient was started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .the urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .6 ) fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :the patient had a mild increase in her bun and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .the patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .dictated by :bone a , m.d. iq35attending :lanay i. iron , m.d. tj93 yb914/4843batch :9056index no. fpof6to0q7d :new years evet :new years day
