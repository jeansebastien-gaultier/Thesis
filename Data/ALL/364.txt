1950s.6. status post umbilical hernia repair in 1945.medications:1. lisinopril 80 mg q d.2. atenolol 25 mg q d.3. aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.allergies: no known drug allergies.social history: the patient quit smoking tobacco approximately 40years ago. occasional alcohol use.family history: his brother had a heart attack in his late 50s.the brother also has diabetes.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 98 , blood pressure190/98 , pulse 48. o2 saturation was 98% ontwo liters by nasal cannula. general: the patient is an elderlyafrican-american gentleman , sitting up in bed in no acute distress ,talking in complete sentences. heent: the left eye has anonreactive pupil. the right eye has a small pupil , approximately2 mm , with a clear cataract. there is no icterus. the oropharynxwas clear with gingival hypertrophy. neck: supple , with fullrange of motion. there was no lymphadenopathy. jvp was difficultto assess because of the large neck. cardiac: regular rate andrhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base. the carotids werewithout bruits. pulmonary: the patient had bibasilar rales withexpiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. abdomen:protuberant , soft , non-tender. normoactive bowel sounds. noorgans appreciated. extremities: edema 2+. femoral pulses were2+. there were bruits. distal pulses were intact. rectal: thepatient was heme-negative.diagnostic studies: sodium 143 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 ,bicarbonate 24 , bun 35 , creatinine 2.0 ,glucose 144. cbc shows wbc 8 , hematocrit 32.9 , platelets 343 , mcvapproximately 80 , rdw approximately 16. admission ck was 175.troponin i was 0.05. chest x-ray showed a questionable bibasilarinfiltrates. ekg showed sinus bradycardia at 56. the axis was 20degrees. the intervals were 0.175/10/96/0.471. there was lvh byvoltage criteria , an isolated q in lead 3 , biphasic t waves in avl ,and a flat t in lead 3.hospital course: by problems:congestive heart failure: the patient underwent a rule outmyocardial infarction protocol and subsequently did rule out.after that he had an exercise echo. the patient exercised forthree minutes on a modified bruce , achieving a maximum heart rateof 97 and a blood pressure of 160. the test was stopped because ofknee pain and shortness of breath. baseline images prior toexercise showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy , with overallnormal function. there were no resting wall motion abnormalities.stress images obtained after peak exercise showed a suggestion of aposterobasilar hypokinesis. no other wall motion abnormalitieswere noted. it was felt that this findings were questionable fornonspecific finding or ischemia. it was felt that the ekg portionof the ett showed no evidence for ischemia. the patient wasdiuresed gently with iv lasix and his shortness of breath improved.hypertension: on admission , the patient's blood pressure wasapproximately 220/110. the patient was started on iv nitroglycerinand iv labetalol in the emergency department. the patient wassubsequently weaned from iv nitroglycerin and switched to p.o.hydralazine and minoxidil , 100 mg t.i.d. and 2.5 mg q d. ,respectively. the patient had excellent blood pressure control onthese medications. the patient was discharged with close follow-upin order to titrate these medications.anemia: the patient's admission hematocrit was 32.2. subsequenthematocrits were very labile , and there was felt to be some laberror involved. follow-up hematocrit was in the mid 20s. this wasrepeated and was again in the mid 20s. he was transfused two unitsof packed red blood cells and underwent upper endoscopy. thefindings were gastritis , with some small erosions in the antrum anda subcutaneous nodules , which was biopsied. h. pylori studies werepending at discharge , as were biopsy results. the patient wasstarted on prilosec 20 mg q d. and will continue with this forseveral weeks. aspirin was held , as the patient's egd findingswere felt to be consistent with nsaid gastritis. iron studiesobtained were not entirely consistent with iron deficient anemia.the serum iron was low. however , the ferritin and tibc were withinthe normal range. further workup of the patient's anemia will takeplace as an outpatient.chronic renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine increasedfrom admission value of 2.0 to 2.5. this was felt to be secondaryto diuresis , and the patient's diuretic dose was decreased. thepatient will need to have outpatient follow-up of his creatinine.discharge medications:1. albuterol inhaler two puffs as needed for shortness of breathand wheezing.2. prilosec 20 mg q d.3. symvastatin 10 mg q d.4. nitroglycerin sublingual as needed for chest pain , pressure ortightness.5. aldomet 750 mg t.i.d.6. minoxidil 2.5 mg q d.7. lisinopril 80 mg q d.8. hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.9. lasix 80 mg q d.10. iron sulfate 300 mg b.i.d.disposition: the patient was discharged to home. he will followup with his primary care
