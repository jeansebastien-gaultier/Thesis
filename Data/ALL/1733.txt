exam.labs on admission: remarkable for a bun of 40 and a creatinineof 1.6 ( this is decreased from 2.7 in october 2005 ). bnp was 95.ck 95 , troponin negative. ekg showed normal sinus rhythm withpacs. normal axis , st depressions in v2 through v6. chest x-rayshowed a left lower lobe infiltrate/opacity. no effusions , noedema.hospital course by systems:1. cardiovascular: ischemia. the patient with shortness ofbreath on admission and st depression in v2 through v6. thepatient had an episode of chest pain at rest on the floor with apositive troponin to 10.8 on 7/26/2005. no progression of theekg changes seen in the emergency room. the patient was startedon iv heparin and cardiology was called to arrange for cardiaccatheterization. however , the patient was noted to have adecrease in her hematocrit from 30 to 23. she was guaiacnegative. cath was initially put on hold for the patient to betransfused. the patient then became chest pain free starting10/7/2005. her enzymes trended down. iv heparin wasdiscontinued on 6/18/2005. the patient had a mibi on5/1/2005 , which showed areas of ischemia in the distal lad andom territories. the patient underwent catheterization on1/23/2005 , which showed chronically occluded rca with collateral50% lad lesion , 95% tubular proximal d1 lesion , 50% tubular om1lesion; no stents were placed. she was continued on aspirin ,beta-blocker , statin , and ace inhibitor. the patient had oneadditional episode of chest pain on 1/21/2005. in this instancechest pain was pleuritic with no associated ischemic symptoms andekg remained unchanged. this was thought unlikely to be ofischemic origin. the patient has no chest pain or shortness ofbreath since this time up until the time of discharge. pump:the patient was felt to be volume overloaded on admission( secondary to lasix noncompliance. the patient was initiallygiven 80 mg of iv lasix with a diuresis of 1.5 liters. diuresiswas then more gentle with an i/o goal of even to negative 500 ccper day. lasix was held prior to cath. the patient was thoughtto be dry status post her large diuresis. the patient willresume her lasix at a lower dose of 40 mg q.d. on discharge. atransthoracic echo on 10/9/2005 showed an ef of 65-70% , mildhypokinesis of the distal anterior and septal walls , trace mr ,mild ai and aortic stenosis ( aortic valve area 0.9 to 1.0 ). thepatient also has a history of hypertension with known unilateralrenal artery stenosis. the patient was initially on lisinopril ,nicardipine , clonidine patch , and imdur. the patient's aceinhibitor was held prior to cath because she was persistentlyhyperkalemic. her systolic blood pressure remained between130-160. the patient will be discharged on a lower dose oflisinopril ( with close followup by her primary care physician ).rhythm: the patient was monitored on telemetry. she showedsinus bradycardia in the 40s to 60s with first-degree block. thepatient was asymptomatic.2. pulmonary: shortness of breath on admission thought to be acombination of copd , recent upper respiratory infection withquestion of a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray as wellas volume overload. the patient was continued on her nebulizers.she was also diuresed. she also completed a course ofazithromycin/cefotaxime for community-acquired pneumonia. hershortness of breath greatly improved since the time of admission.her oxygen saturation was 99-100% on room air ( and withambulation ) at the time of discharge.2. renal: the patient has a history of chronic renalinsufficiency , microalbuminuria , and renal artery stenosis. shehad a recent episode of acute renal failure in the setting ofnonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. her creatinine was 1.8 to2.0 through most of this admission. she underwent renal arteryangiography on 1/23/2005 , which shows moderate stenosis of theright renal artery. no stent was placed. she was givenkayexalate as needed for hyperkalemia. her ace inhibitor washeld temporarily and restarted at a lower dose givenhyperkalemia. her k was 4.6 at the time of discharge. inaddition to the patient's ace inhibitor , lasix , allopurinol , andcolchicine were held prior to cardiac catheterization. she wasgiven mucomyst and intravenous fluids around the time of hercatheterization. her creatinine improved after cath hydration to1.6 on the day of discharge.3. endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes. she wascontinued on lantus with an insulin sliding scale.4. musculoskeletal: the patient complained of right great toepain. this was thought to be a bunion versus the patient's gout.given increased redness , warmth , and swelling the patient wastreated for a gout flare. she was given colchicine ( renallydosed ) and continued on her prophylactic allopurinol. both ofthese medications were held prior to cath. nsaids were avoidedgiven renal insufficiency. the patient was given tylenol forpain with good effect. the patient showed decreased pain andswelling of her right great toe over the course of this admissionand this was resolved on discharge. the patient will becontinued on renally dose prophylactic allopurinol.5. heme: the patient had a drop in hematocrit on 9/30 from 30to 23. she was guaiac negative. she was transfused and thenmaintained to hematocrit of approximately 30 since 10/7/2005.her post cath hematocrit was 27.9 ( repeated at 28.9 ). her groinsite was clean ,
