in the emergency room , a cat scan of the head wasnegative for acute process. troponin was 0.2 , and therefore shewas started on iv heparin.physical examination on admission:temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82 ,respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen 99% on room air. general: thepatient was in no acute distress , alert , and oriented only x1 toperson. heent: nc/at. neck: supple. cardiovascular: normals1 , s2. regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs , rubs , or gallops.lungs were clear bilaterally. abdomen was soft , nontender , andnondistended , positive for bowel sounds.

data:labs on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.3 ,hematocrit was 36.4 , ck of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. her ekgwas normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm st depression in leads ii , iii ,and avf. her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which wasunchanged from her previous x-ray. her head ct was negative.urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white bloodcells , plus

of cardiac enzymes was negative for , thetroponin level was less than assay. the leak was most likely secondary todemand ischemia in the setting of an infection. a c set of her cardiac enzymeswas negative as well. the heparin was therefore discontinued. thepatient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but isnot a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor'snotes. in-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and abeta-blocker , which was changed during her admission fromlopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her bloodpressure remained high
