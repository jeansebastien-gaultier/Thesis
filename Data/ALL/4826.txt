coronary artery disease status post silent mi andcardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction between 15% and 20% , whohas a longstanding history of severe anxiety and presented withfatigue and shortness of breath. on the day of admission , thepatient took an extra dose of lasix because he thought that hemight be fluid overloade. in the emergency room , it was thoughtthat he appeared dry and he was admitted for volumeresuscitation.past medical history: coronary artery disease , silent mi in1998 , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , peptic ulcer disease with gibleed , severe anxiety , cardiomyopathy

oriented. cranial nerves iii through xii intact.strength is 5/5 throughout. the sensation was intact throughout.hospital course by system:1. cardiovascular: upon admission , the patient appeared dry andwas resuscitated with one liter of iv fluids. the patient'slasix was held initially on admission. on hospital day #2 , hewas looking well. his weight was 151 pounds which was suspectedto be close to his dry weight which was reportedly 149 pounds.by 8/18/05 , he was restarted on 20 mg of lasix daily so that he would stayeuvolemic. he received intermittent iv lasix ( 20mg ) throughout the remainderof his hospitalization and his p.o. lasix dose was settled on 40 mg p.o.daily. his captopril was restarted on the 9/19/05 at 6.25 mg t.i.d. hetolerated that dose and was switched to accupril 2.5 mg b.i.d. he underwent anechocardiogram on 11/9/05 which demonstrated possible vegetationon the tricuspid valve verus a flail leaflet. this question of avegetation raised concern for possible endocarditis and bloodculture were sent. the patient's temperature had been low onadmission , since there was some concern that he could bedeveloping sepsis , however nothing grew from the blood culturesthroughout the remainder of his hospitalization. he was seen bycardiology , who did not think that this echo result requiredfurther intervention and suspected that it represented a flailtricuspid valve leaflet. the patient's troponinone troponin level was elevated at 0.11 initially and thenanother troponin was elevated on 10/27/05 in the setting arf andacute hepatitis. he recently had a negative stress echo at thelaketon medical center , so no additional stress testingwas pursued during this admission. he was switched to lopressor25 t.i.d. and then switched back to toprol xl. his statin wasdiscontinued during the admission because of lft abnormalitieswhich will be discussed below. he was monitored on telemetrywhich demonstrated frequent pvcs and some nsvt. thisshould be readdressed in cardiology clinic. cardiology decided to hold off onplacing an aicd and was to see him as an outpt.2. gi/renal: on the morning of 10/27/05 , the patient developed new confusionand delirium. he also developed an oxygenrequirement the night before. his labs on morning were notablefor a transaminitis in the thousands , acute renal failure withhyperkalemia and acidemia with bicarbonate of 13 , and a new leukocytosis ( wbc 9to 25 ). he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage forbartonella as he had many cats. he was empirically started on mucomyst andacyclovir as per gi in case his lft abnormalities were due to tylenoltoxicity or hsv. he was initially going to get a liver biopsy but this wascancelled as his lfts started to normalize. he had a ruq with dopplers whichwas negative. the etiology of his hepatitis , renal failure and leukocytosis wasnever identified throughout the admission. cardiology did not think that anyof this could be explained by endocarditis and his antibiotics were stoppedonce his cultures were negative for multiple days. gi though he could of hadshock liver but he was on telemetry the entire time. his tylenol level wasnormal and his hep seriologies were negative. his labs had all normalized byadmission except for his lfts which were still trending downward.3. infectious disease: due to low temperature and question ofvegetation , there was consideration for endocarditis and sepsisalthough that never panned out. he has a history of feedingstray cats and so bartonella cultures were sent. they take along time to come back and should be followed up as outpatient. he had beenplaced on antibiotics while awaiting cultures but those were discontinued onthe 8/18/05 as the microbiology data remains negative. he had a ct scan of hischest and abdomen which did not reveal any infectious source. he had groundglass opacities on his ct chest which were felt to be due to chf when reviewedwith the radiologist. he remained afebrile during the admission.4. psych: early on during the patient's admission , he did haveseveral episodes of tachypnea at rest. they were not positional in natureand resolved with verbal consolation and redirection anddeep breath. no associated desaturation at that time. thepatient has a history of anxiety and reported that that promptedhim to increase his lasix dose at home. he refused psychiatricconsultation or social work involvement. his valium hadinitially been initiated but it was held in the setting ofabnormal lfts. he had no further anxiety attacks after that. itis likely that he has mild baseline dementia. his deliriumresolved after the acute renal failure and transaminitis resolved.5. musculoskeletal: the patient had a little bit of difficultyambulating and was seen by physical therapy who did think thatfurther physical therapy would be appropriate. the patientrefused to go to rehabilitation facility , so he was planning togo home with services including physical therapy at home.6. hematology: the patient was set to go home and then it wasnoted that his platelets had taken a slow and steady declinethroughout his hospitalization while he was on heparin/lovenox. therewas concern that this could represent heparin inducedthrombocytopenia and so all heparin products were stopped. he was placedlepirudin which was chosen instead of argatroban becauseargatroban was cleared by liver in light of his hepatitis.his initial pf4 was read as bordeline positive , but the laber laterchanged the result to negative. based on this discrepancy another pf4 wassent which was borderline positive. as per the hematology consult , they feltthat despite the borderline positive pf4 he did not need prophylacticanticoagulation and that he should refrain from heparin products in thefuture until a repeat pf4 in checked in a few months.discharge medications: aspirin 325 mg daily , lasix 40 mg daily ,toprol xl 25 mg daily , accupril 5 mg daily , omeprazole 20 mgdaily.diet: low sodium.activity: as tolerated with supervision and advised by thephysical therapist.followup appointments: dr. dougall is the patient's new pcp atthe gham mill ridown medical center clinic at the atl hospital , he has anappointment for 3/23/05 at 9:45 a.m. and an appointment with dr.alquisira was made from cardiology 10/21/05 at 2:45 p.m.additional instructions: do not take valium or lipitor until youare cleared by your doctor to do so due to liver function. weighyourself daily and keep a record and bring that to follow upappointment. if you develop light headedness , shortness ofbreath , chest pain or any other symptoms you are concerned about ,call your doctor or return to the pi hospital emergency room for

previous exam on9/29/05 .  there is hazy opacity in the lower lung soundsparticularly on the right suggesting mild edema. there alsoappears to be small right effusion , mild cardiomegaly is againnoted. on 10/27/05 , cat scan of the abdomen showed no apparentsource of infection , no collection or abscess , limited studysecondary to lack of iv contrast , mild ascites , bilateral

pleural effusion , evidence of pulmonary edema andsmall volume ascites associated with cardiomegaly , nodular groundglass opacities at the right base may be due to atelectasis butsomewhat discrete ,
