s/p r vp shunt, no acute hemorrhagebrief hospital course:26m who was admitted to neurosurgery for a right frontal cysticlesion and a sellar/suprasellar mass with subsequenthydrocephalus. he admitted to the icu for close observationgiven his imaging. a mri was obtained on [5-10] to better evaluatethe lesions.on [5-11] a cta head was obtained for surgical planning. endocrinewas also consulted given the sellar/suprasellar mass. perendocrine request, labs were ordered and a cortisol stimulationtest was done on [5-12] am. hydrocortisone was held in order toperform cortisol stim test.a 1 gram dilantin bolus was given fora serum dilantin level of 0.8. overnight the patient became veryaggitated, pulling out his iv line requiring ativan.  thepatient got out of bed and wanted to leave the hospital "againstmedical advice"on [5-12], patient was seen to have bitemporal hemianopsia, butwas otherwise intact on examination. the cortisol stim teast wasperformed and the cortisol levels at 30 minites, 60 minites and90 minites were.2-30 mins,21-60 mins,22- 90 mins.  neuro-opthowas consulted for formal visual field testing which was done on[2149-5-13] which demonstrated stable bitemporal hemianopsia.endocrine recommended stopping the hydrocortisone and decreasingthe decadron. neuro and rad oncology were also consulted.on [2149-5-14], patient underwent am aspiration of the right frontalcyst and evd placement.  he tolerated the procedure well withoutintraoperative complications.  please review dictated operativereport for details. he was extubated and transferred to the icu.post operative head ct revealed no hemorrhage and significantdecompression.  he was bolused with 500mg of dilantin for asubtherapeuric level of 7.2 and his dose was increased to 200mg[hospital1 ].on [5-15] the evd was clamped after ct head demonstrated stableventricular size however it had to be opened approximately2.5hrs after clamping for severe headache and episode ofconfusion.  it was opened at 10cm above the tragus.  perendocrinology the patient was given cabergoline 0.5mg as aone-time dose and the patient was switched from dexamethasone toprednisone 7.5mg daily according to their recommendations.  hewas given a dilantin bolus of 500mg for a dilantin level of 9.6.on [5-16] the patient's mental status was stable and so an evdwean was started.  the patient tolerated elevation of the drainto 20cm above the tragus.  dilantin level was therapeutic at12.9.  pt was transfered to the stepdown unit.  his ventriculardrain was clamped several times but patient continued to haveelevated icps and severe headaches.  plan for vp shunt waspostponed on [5-20] for fever to 102.7.  fever workup was negativefor dvt with lower extremity dopplers, negative consolidation onchest xray.  blood, urine and csf cultures were sent on [5-20].he devoloped a total body rash that resembled a reaction todilantin and so the patient was transitioned to keppra, dilantinwas stopped and the rash was treated topically withhydrocortisone cream and with oral benadryl prn.  no respiratorydistress, no oral swelling. he was afebrile on [5-21] and wasneurolopgically stable with evd in place while awaiting vp shuntplacement.on [2149-5-23], patient had a right vp shunt place by dr. [first name (stitle) ]. onthe day of surgery he had stress dose steroids withhydrocortisone 50mg q8 and then resumed prednisone 7.5mg daily.now dod, pt is afebrile, vital signs are stable, and toleratinga good oral diet.  his pain is well controlled and incisionappear clean/dry/intact.  he is set for d/c home in stablecondition.medications on admission:nonedischarge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:right frontal cystic masssellar and suprasellar masshydrocephalusincreased intracranial pressurespost operative confusionpost-op feverdischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:general instructions??????	have a friend/family member check your incision daily forsigns of infection.??????	take your pain medicine as prescribed.??????	exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,or excessive bending.??????	you may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples havebeen removed. if your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures,you must keep that area dry for 10 days.??????	you may shower before this time using a shower cap to coveryour head.??????	increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic painmedicine can cause constipation. we generally recommend takingan over the counter stool softener, such as docusate (colace)while taking narcotic pain medication.??????	unless directed by your doctor, do not take anyanti-inflammatory medicines such as motrin, aspirin, advil, andibuprofen etc.??????	if you have been discharged on keppra (levetiracetam), youwill not require blood work monitoring.??????	clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed atyour post-operative office visit.followup instructions:follow-up appointment instructions??????please return to the office in [8-3] days(from your date ofsurgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a woundcheck. this appointment can be made with the nurse practitioner. please make this appointment by calling [telephone/fax (1) 1669].??????please call ([telephone/fax (1) 88] to schedule an appointment with dr.[last name (stitle) ], to be seen in 2 weeks with a head ct- on every other week, you will need visual field testing withdr [last name (stitle) ] call [telephone/fax (1) 253] to follow-up.
