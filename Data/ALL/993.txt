with lasix 40 iv bid increased to 80bid on hd2 as she was not meeting her diuresis goal. with cardiologyservice consulting , she was increase to lasix drip at 15/hr on hd3 , withi/o goal 1-2 l neg. she did well on this and by hd5 was near her dryweight of 49kg and her drip was transitioned back to po lasix. she is noon lasix 80 po bid , which is felt to be adequate to maintain her dryweight. she was continued on hydralazine , lopressol and was restarted onisordil on hd3 , titrated up to 20 tid. she has history of mi withstents and was continued on asa , plavix , zocor. he cardiac enzymes werenegative. her bnp fell from 3500 on admit to 1500 at her dry wt on hd6.she was paced intermittent ( pacer placed in past for sick sinus ,functioning properly at a backup rate of 50 ).2 ) renal: she presented with acute on chronic rf possibly due to poor forforward flow in the setting of chf decompensation. cr up to 3.6 onhd3 , but as she diuresed , her cr stabilized. renal consult was followingand recommended diureses , low k diet , good glucose control , andwithholding ace inhibitor. she is discharge at her dry weight with a crstable at 3.5. she should probably not go on ace inhibitor again.3 ) fen- hyperkalemia w/o ekg change. improved w/ lasix. rec'd kayexylatein ed. now improved. follow k/mg. she should not be on an ace inhibitoror a k-sparing diuretic.4 ) endo-

community hospital at a euvolemic state with a dryweight of 49kg. she should continue on 80 po lasix bid unless her cr risesabove new baseline of 3.5 or if she gains weight or shows signs of newoverload. lovenox should be stopped once her inr is > 2. coumadin doseshould be adjusted according to inr goal 2-3. she should be on a renaldiet with low potassium and low glucose but with diabetic caloricsupplements like glucerna. she should receive a hot pack to her neck 2-3xper day and to her vein before blood draw for comfort.she should receive physical therapy daily with the goal of gait
