[first name (stitle) 4370] [name (stitle) ] was notified of thefindings on [2124-12-22].brief hospital course:this is a 61 yom with hx of htn and copd who initially presentedto the ed c/o sob and noted to be massively fluid overloaded, inarf with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis andsynthetic dysfunction who was then admitted to the micu foraltered mental status and eventually intubated for respiratorydistress and fluid overload.# acute on chronic liver failure:  mr. [known lastname ] presented withtotal body fluid overload.  he had a transaminitis whichimproved and worsened several times throughout his hospitalstay.  he had synthetic dysfunction of the liver manifested bythrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.  all of these findings wereconsistent with cirrhosis.  a ct scan on admission confirmed anodular liver.  he slowly developed worsening liver failureduring his hospitalization.  a liver biopsy was done on [2124-12-21]which confirmed cirrhosis.  hepatitis serologies were sent andwere negative for hep b and hep c.  hep a antibody was positive. hepatology was consulted and cirrhosis was thought to be [3-6]history of etoh abuse.  tranaminitis in the hospital was unclearbut possibly [3-6] shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  inrcontinued to rise and peaked to a level of 27 today.  family wasinvolved and a family meeting was held today given hisworsensing liver failure and shock which was requiring 4pressors.  he was made cmo by his father, [name (ni) ] [name (ni) ], and thepatient passed away peacefully today at 225pm.# hypoxic respiratory failure/pneumonia:  mr. [known lastname ] wasinitially intubated for respiraroty distress in the setting ofhypoxemia [3-6] fluid overload.  he was treated with diureticswith minimal urine output.  renal was consulted and he wasdiagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and required dialysis forfluid removal.  he was placed on hd with good removal of fluidintitially. wbc then began to elevate and cxr was consistentwith pneumonia so he was started on vanco/zosyn/levo fortreament of hospital acquired pneumonia.  he completed a 7 daycourse for his pna.  he self extubated while in the micu and wasthen reintubated for respiratory distress.  he then developedvap while intubated and was treated with vanco/zosyn/cipro.# shock:  patient had acute decompensated liver failure alongwith pneumonia which were likely contributing to his shock.broead infectious workup was done and workup remained negativewhile in the hospital.  he was treated with vanco/zosyn/ciprofor treatment of hap.  flagyl was started out of concern forc.diff although c.diff cultures remained negative.# altered mental status: thought to be secondary to hepaticencephalopathy.  initially improved with lactulose.  patient wastreated with lactulose and rifaximin throughout his stay.# acute renal failure:  thought to be [3-6] hepatorenal syndrome.he developed anuria while in the hospital.  given his fluidoverload and pulmonary edema requiring intubation, renal wasconsulted and a dialysis line was placed.  he was placed on hdfor removal of fluid.  this was changed to cvvh when he becamehypotensive to allow for gentle fluid removal.# hyponatremia: thought to be [3-6] fluid overload in the settingof cirrhosis# coagulopathy: likley [3-6] cirrhosis and liver failuremedications on admission:1. combivent inhaler2. cyclobenzaprine 10 mg tablet3. doxazosin mesylate 8 mg tab4. finasteride 5 mg tablet5. fluconazole 200 mg tablet6. gabapentin 100 mg capsule7. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tab8. ketoconazole 2% cream9. laclotion 12% lotion10. nystatin 100,000 unit/gm powd11. urea 40% creamdischarge medications:expireddischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:expireddischarge condition:expireddischarge instructions:expiredfollowup instructions:expired
