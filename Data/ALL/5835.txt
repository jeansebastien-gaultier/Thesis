yeast.    ~7000/ml.brief hospital course:76 y.o woman with pmh of ipf,copd,anemia, mechanical mitralvalve,and pacemaker presents with worsening dyspnea, acute renalfailure, and fluid overload.#. anemia: on admission hemoglobin of 4.6 and hematocrit of 14.2from ahgb 10 and hct 33.1 within the last several weeks. hemolysislabs negative, and rectal exam showed guiac positive brownstool. her anemia was believed to be secondary to a gi bleed.she was transfused 4 units total with appropriate hct response,and her hct/hgb ramined stable. she underwent egd/colonoscopywhich showed esophageal and fundal varices and a large polyp inthe colon, concerning for malignancy which was believed to bethe source of bleeding.  on biopsy, this lesion was found to bean adenoma with high grade dysplasia. gastroenterology believedthat it would be possible to perform a transluminal resectionbut that the procedure would have high risk of perforation anddeath. after a goals of care discussion with the [hospital 228]health care proxy, [name (ni) ] [name (ni) 15155], and the gastroenterology teamit was decided that though the adenoma is high risk formalignancy, she will likely succumb to her severe pulmonarydisease in the next 1-5 years and removal of the mass is not inline with her goals of care. she was started on nadolol foresophageal varaces.outpatient issues:-- obtain 2x weekly hcts and transfuse for hct <21-- continue fe supplementation and epo administration.#. hypoxemic respiratory failure: the patient presented on 5ltrans-trach from a baseline of 4l at home in the setting ofknown ipf, copd, and chronic heart failure.  her dyspnea wasattributed to anemia vs fluid overload from chf, and remainedstable in-house and gradually improved upon discharge from theicu.  there was low suspicion for a copd or ipf exacerbation.she was given iv torsemide for diuresis with her packed red celltransfusions, and her home bumex was held in-house.  her homeprednisone and nebulizers were continued in-house.  related toher shortness of breath, she occassionally coughed up "bloodballs", which she attributed to bloodly mucous originating ather catheter site.  these were inconsistent, and associated withepistaxis, and we believed that there was a component of bloodypost-nasal drip contributing, exacerbated by the fact that shewas on a heparin gtt for her heart valve.  the total blood lossfrom these episodes was essentially non-contributory.  on thefloor, she continued to be dyspneic at times.  she was found tohave evidence of a rul hap, so she was started empirically onvancomycin and cefepime. she developed progressive respiratorydistress and returned the micu where she was intubated. sheunderwent broncheoalveolar lavage which was culture negative andher antibiotics were discontinued on [10-23]. she continued to beintermittently diuresed but it was stopped when her creatininebumped from 1.8 to 2.7. she was extubated and returned to themedical floor with o2 sats 95% on 2lnc the thought is that herrespiratory distress was likely due to a mucus plug andpulmonary edema. after two days on the medical floor, she pulledout a nasogastric tube which had been used for tubefeeds,aspirated and developed respiratory distress with hypoxia andacidemia. she was transferred to the micu for a third time whereshe was again intubated. out of concern for hcap the pt wasstarted on vanc/[last name (un) 2830]. due to increasing wbc and decreased stooloutput there was also concern for c.diff, which ultimately waspositive, and the pt was started on flagyl/po vanc. the pt'srespiratory status improved and she was successfully extubated.vancomycin was discontinued on [10-30] with plan to complete atotal of 8d of meropenem.outpatient issues:-- continue meropenem thru [11-3].-- ongoing discussion regarding replacement of transtrachealcatheter..#clostridium difficile: the pt was found to have a rising wbc,episodes of hypotension and decreased stool output. she wasempirically started on iv flagyl and po vanco which werecontinued when stool culture was positive for c.diff. pt hadsubsequent decreased in wbc to normal with improvement in loosestools.outpatient issues:-- plan to complete po vancomycin 125mg po q6hrs as well asflagyl 500mg q8hrs; end date [11-9]..#anticoagulation: patient anticoagulated due to presence ofmechanical valve. patient presented with an inr of 10 forunclear reasons.  she received 5mg po vit k, and her inrdown-trended to the sub-therapeutic range and she was started ona heparin gtt for her mechanical mitral valve.  she experiencedepistaxis and coughed up bloody mucus in the setting of aslightly supratherapeutic ptt which resolved with decreasing herheparin gtt.  she was kept on a heparin drip for bridging on themedicine floor.  when the decision was made to pursueendomucosal resection of her adenoma, her warfarin wasdiscontinued, however given this was put on hold, the pt wasrestarted on coumadin [10-29]. at time of discharge patientremained on hep gtt as well as coumadin 3mg daily; inr on day ofdischarge 1.9outpatient issues:-- continue hep gtt and coumadin until inr therapeutic (2.5 -3.5)..#volume
