a history of hypertension and gout who isbeing treated on the biologics service with il-2 for metastaticmelanoma.  he began the protocol on monday and had beentollerating the tid il-2 infusions, but had a decline in hisplts from 200 to 56 as well as a 11# weight gain attributed tocapillary leak.  he also had significant electrolyte imbalances,tachycardia, and tachypnea expected from this protocol.   on the day of [hospital unit name 153] transfer, patient had some mild epigastricdiscomfort and complained to his daughter of heartburn.  ofnote, he was on daily indocin while on il-2 therapy.  at 10pm,he developed some diarrhea and then had an episode of nausea andvomiting.  the covering md noted 2 very large blood clotts inthe emesis.  noted increased rr of 40s, was 84% on ra and

his left abdomen.  he underwent wide localexcision and sentinel lymph node biopsy at that time whichrevealed no residual melanoma and the 3 sentinel nodes werenegative.  two years later in [4-18], he developed a red raisednodule under the scar of the local excision.  this was reexcisedand he subsequently did well until [8-/2169] when he had anothersatellite recurrence and reexcision.  he then had

continued for 19days.  he has been on vanco for 8 days. the pt's lft elevationwas attributed to il-2 therapy, a known side effect..also, he was noted to have renal insufficiency, with cr to 1.6,and
