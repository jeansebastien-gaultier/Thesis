after having a vfib arrest at the mall on 02/04/33, with defibrillation x 5 in the field (3x by bystanders, and 2x by ems). pt converted to nsr in the field. he was stabilized at blakely house, then transferred to namc. at namc, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and dr. albright   s team was consulted. as pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to fremont medical center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. at fmc, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy. he is transferred back to namc today in preparation for cabg, planned 3/07/33.pmh: v-fib arrest on 02/04/33 due to severe cadsevere coronary artery disease,
