[known lastname ] is a [age over 90 ] year old male with a history of atrialfibrillation, systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease whopresents from nh with altered mental status.  per report, pt wasnoted by staff at nh yesterday to be difficult to arouse andhaving labored breathing.  his vitals at the time included bp112/57, and o2 sats and temperature were not obtainable duelikely to hypothermia.  he was sent to the [hospital1 18] ed for furtherrevaluation.  of note, per his daughter, he was recentlyhospitalized ([2015-7-16]) from [hospital3 ] hospital with congestiveheart failure.  during this hospitalization he was noted to havedeteriorating mental status and delirium, which is why he hadbeen discharged to nh.in the ed, vs t 92.1 axillary, bp 100/50, hr 50, rr 21 88%

acute intracranial process.  also received 1 livf total in ed.on arrival to micu, he was noteedd to be bradycardic to hrs to30s and hypotensive to sbp 80s with maps 50s.  he was given 1 mgatropine

year old male with a history of systolic congestive heartfailure, atrial fibrillation, who presented with hypoxia,hypotension, and hypothermia.upon admission to the micu, agressive therapy was initiatedkeeping a broad differential diagnosis. patient howevercontinued to deteriorate and abruptly became profoundlybradycardic, unresponsive to atropine or increasing doses ofpressors, culminating in asystole; patient was pronounced deadat 1:05am on [2105-7-28]. below are the details leading to theseevents, arranged by problem:1)hypotension / hypothermia: on initial presentation on thefloor sbp 80s, given 500cc fluid bolus x 2 with sbp to 90s.meets sirs criteria with hypothermia and tachpnea andhypotension concerning for sepsis, with pneumonia as the mostlikely source.  also on differential was hypovolemic hypotensionfor occult blood loss, cardiogenic shock, adrenal insuffiencyand myxedema coma. cooling blanket placed on patient uponarrival.patient was given fluid boluses and central access was obtained.echocardiogram was obtained and revealed mildly depressedejection fraction (40%) with inferolateral wall hypokinesis andmoderate tricuspid regurgitation. central venous pressure wasmeasured and found to be elvated to 24mmhg, which even in thesetting of tr was felt to rule out hypovolemia. patient wasinitiated on dopamine in hopes of supporting both blood pressureand heart rate. arterial line was placed for accurate assessmentof arterial pressure. hematocrit remained stable and pressureresponded to pressor support.patient started on stress dose steroids for possible adrenalinsufficiency.2)hypoxia: with bilateral infiltrates and likely superimposedfluid overlaod.  given recent hospitalization and extent of o2requirement, high suspicion for hospital acquired pneumonia(hap) with vancomycin and zosyn. this was later changed tovancomycin and cefepime. patients blood gas was concerning forhypercarbia, and after re-discussing goals of care with familyand confirming patient did not want to be intubated, noninvasive ventillation was initiated. patient tolerated nippvwell and hypoxia / hypercarbia / respiratory acidosis improveduntil his sudden decompensation.3)bradycardia: with baseline bradycardia per history, unclearetiology.  on arrival to micu, bradycardic to hr in 30s, gave 1mg atropine with hr to 50s.  all nodal agents were stopped andheart rate improved with dopamine administration.4)meningitis: given patients poor baseline mental status andfindings of significant nuchal rigidity, concern for meningitiswas raised. given patients decompensated status, lumbar puncturewas not pursued and empiric coverage with ampicillin forlisteria, vancomycin/cefepime for staph/strep were initiated.5)hypothyroidism: tsh of 20, difficult to interpret in thissetting as sick euthyroid may have impacted laboratory results.given decompensated state, endocrine consult was placed andthyroid hormone was supplemented intravenously at higher dosesthan per outpatient regimen. free t3, t4 and thyroid bindingprotein were ordered but were not available before patientdecompensated. per endocrine team recommendations, t3 was notgiven due to concerns for arrythmia and cardiac side effects,and given very poor level of evidence for its efficacy.6)coagulopathy: inr 7.2 on admission in setting ofanticoagulation.  given vitamin k and ffp. dic labs negative.7)chronic kidney disease: with known baseline ckd stage iii,likely exacerbated in the setting of hypotension.medications on admission:acetaminophen 325 mg prn[doctor last name ]
