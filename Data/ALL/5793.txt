[2172-8-25]after found to have large mediastinal mass, today found to bepoorly-differentiated carcinoma, suspected small cell. oninitial evaluation, patient was found to have 3mm opening ofdistal trachea secondary to external compression frommediastinal mass, rul mass, rul collapse, and clinical findingsconsistent with svc sydrome. y-stent was placed that evening, inaddition to pigtail catheter for right-sided effusion. patientremained intubated following surgery, on paralytics due tolow-lying et tube and small volume bleeding after endobronchialbiopsy. on [2172-8-26], extubated was attempted. patient wasreintubated within 10 minutes due to neurologicalunresponsiveness, hypoxia (o2 saturation 80s), and hemodynamicinstability. she was found to have a right pneumothorax, whichimproved with subsequent placement of chest tube. patient wasalso noted to have pericardial effusion; given absence ofphysiologic tamponade, cardiology decided againstpericardiocentesis..hospital course also complicated by hyponatremia on admission(na 118) attributed to siadh and improved with fluid restriction(na 126). also with hypotension (sbp 90s) following reintubationon [2172-8-26]. given hyperkalemia, hyponatremia adrenalinsufficiency was suspected; evaluated by endocrine team whorecommended stress dose steroids pending further evaluation ofetiology of hypotension. also with non-anion gap metabolicacidosis, transient hypothermia (t 95 [2172-8-26]) of unknownetiology..per report, patient has done well today. she remains intubated,on pressure support. given the above

concerning for a primary lung carcinoma.2. right upper lobe collapse with nonenhancing lung parenchyma.tumor involvement cannot be excluded. atelectasis of the rightlower and middle lobe.3. large right pleural effusion..[8-25] tracheal mass tissue pathology:immunohistochemical studies show that tumor cells are positivelystained by ttf-1 and ck7; they are negative for ck20,chromogranin, and synaptophysin.  the tumor shows areas ofnecrosis, extensive apoptosis and focal lymphatic vascularinvasion; some areas  the tumor cell size approaching that of asmall cell carcinoma, but much of the tumor has larger nuclei.overall, the tumor probably fits into the spectrum of a smallcell carcinoma of lung..[8-26] pleural fluid cytology:rare groups of epithelioid cells, too few to characterizefurther. by immunohistochemistry: mesothelial cells stain forcalretinin and wt-1. epithelial markers [last name (un) ]-31, cea, and b72.3are negative. rare cells are highlighted by ttf-1; however,these cells are not cytologically atypical and may representnon-specific reactivity..[8-26] ekg: sinus tachycardia. low qrs voltage in limb leads. noprevious tracing available for comparison..[8-26] echo:the left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normalcavity size and regional/global systolic function (lvef>55%).right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal withgood leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. the mitralvalve appears structurally normal with trivial mitralregurgitation. there is a small to moderate sized, primarilyanterior pericardial effusion without right ventriculardiastolic collapse. impression: suboptimal image quality.mild-moderate, primarily anterior pericardial effusion. mildsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global andregional biventricular systolic function.if clinically indicated, a follow-up study is suggested..[8-27] ct chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast:1. vascular findings unchanged from [2172-8-25]. narrowing of svcand leftbrachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass. the svc isnarrowed toapproximately 5 mm over a region extending 3 cm in craniocaudaldimension.indirect evidence of right brachiocephalic vein

chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p xrt andchemo for future xrt sessions):1. right anterior pneumothorax has resolved.2. mixed response of the tumor to radiotherapy with a decreaseof the central component of the tumor and a mixed response ofthe peripheral tumor components:3. the peripheral consolidations in the right upper lobe haveoveralldecreased in size, however, a new cavitary lesion has formedmeasuring 11 x 19 mm.4. the peripheral consolidations in the right lower lobe andleft lower lobe have increased in size, number and density andmay be part of post-obstructive, post-radiotherapy, post-infectious, or acuteinflammatorychanges.5. lymphangio-carcinomatosis in the right upper lobe.6. there is new small right pleural effusion and increasedmoderate leftpleural effusion.7. left adrenal gland mass is only partially visualized in thisstudy..[2172-9-3] eeg: markedly abnormal portable eeg due to the verydisorganized and slow background rhythms. this suggests awidespread and moderately severe encephalopathy in both corticaland subcortical structures. medications, metabolic disturbances,and infection are among the most common causes. although therewere fleeting asymmetries, there was no reliable area of focalslowing. encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. there aresome sharp features, but no clearly epileptiform abnormalitiesand no electrographic

course:[hospital unit name 153] course [date range (3) 84902]58f with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by svcsyndrome, airway compromise requiring y-stent, pericardialeffusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, andelectrolytes disturbances admitted to [hospital unit name 153] for radiationdecompression therapy and chemotherapy. pt developed respiratoryfailure and renal failure..#. hypoxic respiratory failure: pt was initially transferredfrom sicu to [hospital unit name 153] on cpap/ps. she developed increasingrespiratory failure and was changed to ac mode.  in the [hospital unit name 153],she underwent xrt x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days. increasedhypoxia may have been due to pneumothorax, which resolved,pleural effusions, atelectasis, possible vap, tumor compression.during hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, bothtimes of which demonstrated the ett lodged between tracheal walland stent. pt's saturation improved with repositioning.respiratory status also complicated by possible underlying copdgiven smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping. ptwas started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started[2172-8-31] for 8 day course) for vap. vanco was later held as thelevel was elevated in the setting of renal failure.  patient'sfamily decided to persue comfort only care on [2172-9-6], and shewas terminally extubated.  patient expired 15 minutes later fromrespiratory failure and asystole secondary to lung cancer..# altered mental status: pt had decline in mental status overtime. she initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later wasless responsive. ams continued despite sedation being off. amsmost likely due to toxic metabolic syndrome in setting of uremiaand multi-system organ failure. differential also includedseizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, onanti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although eeg didnot demonstrate focal abnormalities. lp did not demonstrateinfection or spread of malignancy. ct head [2172-9-2] negative foracute process..#. small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probablyfits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. givenassociated svc syndrome, prognosis poor. ct head/[last name (un) 103]/pelvisnegative for metastases.  pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapyand 2 sessions of xrt.  initially, xrt was clinical emergency -normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissuenoted on bronchoscopy [2172-9-4]. pt was to undergo formal tissueplanning session on [2172-9-8] to better delineate area of radiationhowever family decided to persue comfort only care on [2172-9-6]..# acute renal failure: in setting of chemo with carboplatin.urine casts consistent with atn. uric acid and electrolyteselevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysissyndrome.  the next therapeutic step was dialysis as patientbecame oliguric despite volume overload but the family wishedfor comfort only care given dismal prognosis of her lung cancer..#. metabolic acidosis: originally thought to be non-gapmetabolic acidosis due to hypoaldosteronism and type iv rta.with low albumin, however, this is a gap metabolic acidosis,most likely due to uremia. unable to increase rr to compensatedue to concern for auto-peeping in setting of possible copd.goal ph is 7.3-7.35. on [2172-9-5], pt's acidosis worsened with ph7.16-7.18. despite adjusting ett placement and decreasing rr toreduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened. bicarbonate was given..# tachycardia/hypotension ?????? pt with tachycardia to 140s andepisodes of hypotension to sbp low 80s. pt with new a-fib ontelemetry and ekg. ddx includes possible enlarging pericardialeffusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and echo[2172-9-5] was unchanged from prior. no pneumothorax seen on cxr.unable to assess for pe by cta as pt in renal failure and vqwould not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology. leni'snegative for dvt. pe likely given malignancy and prolonged bedrest but unable to do cta given renal failure and vq scan nothelpful in setting of lung changes. even if it had beenpositive, heme/onc recommended against anti-coagulation insetting of possible tumor necrosis/hemorrhage. pt remainedtachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses..#. electrolyte disturbances: pt developed hypernatremia on[2172-9-4] most likley due to dehydration with free water deficitof 1.4l, started on d5w. pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia onadmission, both resolved. unclear etiology of electrolytedisturbances on admission- hyponatremia thought to be secondaryto possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or possiblysiadh.  low una does not exclude siadh; renal recommendedrechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done insetting of pt??????s other medical issues. hyperkalemia originallyattributed to hypoaldosteronism and type iv rta, but unlikelyper endocrine because of low urine sodium..#. svc syndrome:  incomplete occlusion of svc; near completeocclusion of brachiocephalic veins. clinically identified byupper extremity and facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin.also with scleral edema. unable to assess jugular venousdistension given considerable swelling. seen in appoximately 10%cases of sslc. improved edema on exam compared to admission. svcsyndrome occurred after y-stent placed. possible that tumorpushing into trachea shifted to compress svc after stentplacement. she underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy fordecompression..#. pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement[2172-8-25], removed [2172-8-31]. ldh effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate bylight??????s criteria). greatest concern for malignant effusionhowever cytology was nonspecific.  cultures of fluid allpreliminary negative..#. pneumothorax: developed pneumothorax in setting ofre-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement..#. pericardial effusion:  suspected by cardiology to bemalignant effusion. felt not to be large enough for percutaneousdrainage. ekg without signs of electrical alternans but doeshave low voltages. repeat echo done [2172-9-5] in setting ofhypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion..# sinus pause on telemetry: pt had episodes of sinus pauses ontele night of [8-30] with turning to right side. occurred again[2172-9-4] again with re-positioning. metoprolol was held andglucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity,but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their ownwithout intervention. cardiology consulted who felt it wasvagally mediated. [month (only) 116] have been due to ett tube displacementpressing on carotid when pt was turned..# leukopenia/thrombocytopenia ?????? most likely due to chemotherapyand no improvement in counts on neupogen. she was repeatedlypan-cultured with negative results..#. anemia:  normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronicdisease given malignancy.  hemolysis labs were negative..# s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  history of cerebral aneurysmrepair with a number of chronic changes on head ct.  herantiepileptic medications were continued.medications on admission:home medications:metoprololomeprazolelevetiracetamcarbatrolmedications on transfer to [hospital unit name 153] [2172-8-27]:furosemide 10 mg iv once duration: 1 dosescarbamazepine 900 mg po qpmcarbamazepine 400 mg po qamartificial tears preserv. free 1-2 drop both eyes prn dry eyespotassium phosphate iv sliding scaleinsulin sc sliding scaleinsulin regular 10 unit iv once, dextrose 50% 25 gm iv onceduration: 1 doses 08/20 @ 0608propofol 20-50 mcg/kg/min iv drip titrate to moderate/heavysedationchlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse 15 ml oral [hospital1 ]hydrocortisone na succ. 100 mg iv q8hnicotine patch 14 mg td dailylevetiracetam 500 mg iv bidmagnesium sulfate iv sliding scalecalcium gluconate iv sliding scalepotassium chloride iv sliding scalealbuterol-ipratropium [1-10] puff ih q6hpantoprazole 40 mg iv q24hheparin 5000 unit sc tidfentanyl citrate 25-100 mcg iv q6h:prn sedationdischarge medications:expireddischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:expireddischarge condition:expireddischarge instructions:expiredfollowup instructions:expired                             [first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (namepattern1) 2437] md [md number(1) 2438]
