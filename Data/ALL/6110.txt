nice brisk upstoke, minimal diastolic flow, diminuitiveica and potential dissection versus intracranial carotiddisease- cta and clinical correlation is suggested.brief hospital course:71 m with as (0.8) and one vessel cad p/w resp. distress thatprompted intubation. he is presently hypotensive, tachycardicand profoundly hypoxic..acute issues:# hypoxia - patient arrived intubated after presenting to oshwith sob. bilateral pulm infiltrates were severe and mostradiologically c/w pulm edema. however, the patient had fluidresponsive tachycardia and a low cvp (through the picc). hisresp distress progressed despite lasix diuresis at nvmc.accordingly, initial differential included ards from sepsis (seebelow), dad, multifocal pna, flash pulmonary edema anddaptomycin pneumonitis. he was ventilated with ardsnet settings. pt was able to be weaned to minimal ventilator settings by day8 of intubation.  however, extubation was delayed due to pt'smental status.  despite holding sedation for several days, ptremained non-responsive.  he was successfully extubated on day11 of intubation.  he successfully transitioned from nasalcanula to room air and has an oxygen saturation of 97-100% onroom air at time of discharge..# hypotension - inital presentation with low cvp implies poorpreload implicating aortic stenosis as a cause. tachycardiaimproved with fluid boluses supporting poor preload.differential also included cardiac event, sepsis, peep effectand propofol. fluids and pressors were administered with goalmap > 60. palliative valvuloplasty was attempted. tte showedpost-valvuloplasty aortic valve area of 0.8cm2. he waspan-cultured and initially continuted on vancomycin (gentomycinwas held given [last name (un) ]).  he was successfully weaned off pressorsand maintained map >65..# e. faecalis infection:  pt diagnosed with e.faecalis onprevious admission and was discharged on dapto/gentamycin.  ininterim, pt developed [last name (un) ] that was attributed to gentamycintoxicity.  dapto/gent was discontinued and he was started onvancomycin (vanc sensitivity mic of 2). infectious disease teamwas consulted and per their recommendations, vancomycin wasdiscontinued due to risk of increasing kidney injury.  pt wasresumed again on daptomycin.  blood cultures remained negativeduring this hospitalization.  he is to complete a 6 week courseof daptomycin for bacteremia (should be discontinued around[2120-8-28] - however exact date of discontinuation should decidedat follow-up id appointment on [2120-8-20])..# uti: pt developed fever and leukocytosis during his icu stay.a ua demonstrated pyuria, and he grew proteus resistant to ciprobut sensitive to ceftriaxone. he was started on ceftriaxone 1gmdaily for a 14 day course which should be completed on [2120-8-29]..# atrial fibrillation:  pt developed new onset paroxysmal atrialfibrillation during hospitalization with heart rates up to 150s. he was rate controlled with iv and po metoprolol.  he wasloaded with amiodarone and was started on anticoagulation withheparin and coumadin.  he spontaneously converted back to sinusrhythm and has remained in sinus for several days without anyrecurrence of afib.  he was taken off heparin drip once inr wastheraputic at 2.0-3.0. he should be continued on amio 400 mg podaily for 1 week, and then decreased to maintenance dose of amio200 mg po daily.  his inr has been theraputic on coumadin 5mg podaily..# renal failure - pt presented with acute renal failure, thoughtto be secondary to gentamicin use with a creatinine that peakedat 3.7. pt' severe respiratory distress was thought to be due tovolume overload so cvvh was initiated.  there were issues ofkinking with the cvvh catheter and the line had to be replacedtwo times in order to achieve adequate flow. pt tolerated cvvhwell with only one episode of hypotension thought to be relatedto excessive fluid shifts during the cvvh. cvvh was discontinuedon [8-5] when pt began putting out good urine to iv lasix. by theend of his stay, pt was euvolemic, his creatinine was trendingdown and he no longer required lasix..# altered mental status/stroke - there was difficulty extubatingpatient due to persistent mental status alteration. he wasinconsistently responsive to painful stimuli and failed torespond to simple commands even though he had been quite alertand interactive prior to his hospitalization. this alteredmental status was initially attributed to oversedation duringintubation so sedation was withheld for several days without anyimprovement in mental status. concern was then raised forischemic stroke given his recent episodes of atrial fibrillation(see below). on exam, it was noticed that he seemed to hadclonus on his right side and appeared to have gaze preference tothe left. neurology was consulted who recommended a ct head andmri/mra of the head. ct head showed left parietal hypodensityextending to the cortex with an appearance of subacute infarctof few days' duration. follow-up mri/mra confirmed thesefindings but also showed diminished flow in the right ica. f/uultrasound of the carotids demonstrated intracranial dissectionon the right but per vascular surgery, no intervention is neededand he can follow-up with vascular surgery in six months forinterval evaluation of any changes. however, he should befurther evaluated with cta once his renal function improves.most likely etiology of the stroke is thrombus dislodged duringvalvuloplasty or during pt's episodic episodes of atrialfibrillation. after patient was successfully extubated, hismental status improved significantly. he was alert and able tofollow commands consistently. he had a tremor in his face andextremities (though this was present at baseline) and pt has anexpressive aphasia, able to answer questions only in shortsentences. per neurology, pt is now exhibiting symptoms ofparkinsonism but would defer treatment at this point..# diabetes: pt continue to have elevated bg to 300s during icustay.  he required insulin drip to manage his sugars.  [hospital ]clinic was consulted and pt was started on lantus 45 units alongwith sliding scale insulin as attached..chronic issues:# aortic stenosis: prior to admission pt was being evaluated forcorevalve procedure, however evalution was complicated byenterococcus infection.  because of hypotension on presention,palliative valvuloplasty was attempted but was not successfulbecause of technical difficulties.  post-valvuloplasty aorticarea was 0.8cm2.  volume status was monitored closely duringadmission because pt is very preload depended.  even if deemedan appropriate candidate, he will not be eligable for corevalvefor at least 6 months now given acute cva..# cad: pt continued on aspirin, metoprolol, and rosuvastatinduring hospitalization..# hypertension: pt resumed on metoprolol once hypotensionresolved..# hyperlipidemia: continue rosuvastatin.transitional issues:he remained full code this admission.  acute parietal infarcthas left pt with many residual deficits and will require intenserehab and close follow-up with many specialties.medications on admission:1. furosemide 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. oxazepam 10 mg tid3. klor-con 10 10 meq qd4. gabapentin 800 mg tid5. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg [hospital1 ]6. rosuvastatin 5 mg daily7. glimepiride 4 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily ().8. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).9. docusate sodium 100 mg [hospital1 ]10. insulin aspart sliding scale(gent and dapto)discharge medications:1. senna 8.8 mg/5 ml syrup sig: 1-2 tablets po bid (2 times aday) as needed for constipation.2. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 ml liquid sig: [2-11]  po bid (2 times aday).3. rosuvastatin 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).4. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid(2 times a day).5. aspirin 81 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet, chewablepo daily (daily).6. warfarin 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po days([doctor first name ],mo,tu,we,th,fr,sa).7. amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).8. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q6h (every6 hours) as needed for pain.9. ceftriaxone in dextrose,iso-os 1 gram/50 ml piggyback sig:one (1)  intravenous q24h (every 24 hours).10. daptomycin 500 mg recon soln sig: six hundred (600) mgintravenous q24h (every 24 hours).11. pantoprazole 40 mg recon soln sig: one (1) recon solnintravenous q24h (every 24 hours).12. dextrose 50% in water (d50w)     syringe sig: one (1)intravenous prn (as needed) as needed for hypoglycemia protocol.13. insulin glargine 100 unit/ml solution sig: forty five (45)units subcutaneous once a day: at lunch.14. oxazepam 10 mg capsule sig: ten (10) mg po three times a dayas needed for anxiety.15. gabapentin 800 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital6 1293] -
