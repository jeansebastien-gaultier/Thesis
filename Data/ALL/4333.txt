record date: 2098-06-13betty has been doing "okay" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability.  she had a video swallow at sjmh; she and fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.  her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.she is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.she recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.echocardiogram:date: 9/02/95: borderline lvh, preserved ef.  posterobasal hk.  not done for pfo.brain & vessel studies:mri/a:cta:3/20/98: "severe proximal lica stenosis", just distal to bifurcation...no comment on comparison.9/29/95:  >90% rcca, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.  >90% lcca proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.  70-75% lica.  the estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.  compared to the study of 9/04/95, the lica lesion is modestly worse. >50% in b ecas.9/26/95: lbif stenosis >= 50%.  rbif without significant stenosis.  rva dominant.  	  	  	  	  	  	ultrasound:8/24/95: low rcca 50-75%, mid lcca 75-90%, calcified lica possibly >50%  	  	  	  	  	  	angiography:8/27/95: proximal rcca stenosis >80%, aca cross-filling from l-->r.  right vertebral irregular/stenotic.  lcca, bifurcation, lica with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-lcca, >80%.  	  	functional cerebrovascular studies:diamox spect 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.  	  	vascular procedures:right cea (years ago)8/31/95: (1) right vertebral origin balloon angioplasty, successful.
