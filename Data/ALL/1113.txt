mbaprincipal diagnosis:the diagnosis responsible for causing the admission is pleuraleffusions.discharge diagnosis:pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure.chief complaint:shortness of breath.history of present illness:the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of congestiveheart failure , coronary artery disease , atrial fibrillation ,chronic renal insufficiency , and non-small cell carcinoma of theleft lung , status post resection in 1997. he presents withshortness of breath. he lives in a nursing home and wasdiagnosed with pneumonia more than three weeks prior toadmission. the pneumonia , per report , was bilateral , leftgreater than right. he was started on a 10-day course oflevofloxacin , which he completed. he subsequently developed c.diff colitis and was treated with flagyl. three days prior tothe present admission , he noticing increased shortness of breath ,worsened with any movement in bed. a chest x-ray at the nursinghome reportedly showed an increased opacity in the right lowerbase , concerning for recurrent pneumonia. for this , he wasrestarted on levofloxacin. on the day of admission , his oxygensaturation dropped to 77% on room air , with improvement to themid 90's on 3 liters of oxygen. he noted a mild dry cough. herdenied headache , dizziness , chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominaldiscomfort , or dysuria. his son reported that he has mildorthopnea at baseline , unchanged in recent days. notably , he wasadmitted to the sho hospital in 5/23 for subacute shortness ofbreath , thought to be due to a chf exacerbation , treated withlasix diuresis. an echocardiogram at that time showed anejection fraction of 55% , with mild left atrial enlargement , andmild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , along withinferobasal wall

for many years , currently anonsmoker. her denies any alcohol or illicit drug use.family history:notable for a father with diabetes and a brother with heartdisease.summary of the hospital course:1. shortness of breath: the patient initially presented withshortness of breath , saturating 77% on room air. he was noted onchest x-ray to have moderate bilateral effusions. the effusionswere likely secondary to congestive heart failure , althoughpneumonia with parapneumonic effusions could not be excluded.given that he was afebrile with a decreasing white count and notincreasingly hypoxic , parapneumonic effusions were consideredless likely compared to worsening chf. given the concern forchf , he was given lasix 40 mg iv approximately one to two doses aday for large volume diuresis , with a goal of total body balanceof 2 liters negative per day. over the course of hishospitalization , his bilateral effusions improved , although therewere small effusions noted on the chest x-ray at the time ofdischarge. his oxygen requirement decreased , and on the day ofdischarge , he was saturating 97-98% on 1 liter. of note , thepatient was brought to ultrasound for a planned guidedthoracocentesis , but the effusion sites were small such that inthe context of this clinical improvement , thoracocentesis wasdeferred. he was maintained initially as well with vancomycinand levofloxacin , although the vancomycin was discontinued afterfour days , and the levofloxacin was discontinued on discharge ( ofnote , he received 10 days total of levofloxacin starting from3/27/2006 at his nursing home ). echocardiogram noted anejection fraction of 55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy ,consistent with diastolic dysfunction. the etiology of hiscongestive heart failure and pleural effusions was thereforethought to be atrial fibrillation with rvr. in terms of followup , he needs daily weights; if he gains greater than 2 poundsover 24 hours , it is recommended that his lasix dose be doubledfor that day. as a discharge , he is being sent out on lasix 40mg p.o. daily.2. cardiovascular:a. ischemia: the patient initially had a small troponin leak0.32 , which was thought secondary to demand ischemia from atrialfibrillation with rvr. for this , he was briefly started on aheparin drip. subsequently , cardiac enzymes trended down. thepatient was maintained on coumadin and aspirin 81 mg , along withzocor and questran for hyperlipidemia. on hospital day #3 to #4 ,telemetry noted pauses. ekg showed in addition to pausing , newt-wave inversions in anterior precordial leads , associated withst depression. this is thought to be either due to ischemia ordigitalis toxicity. his digoxin levels measured 1.3 to 1.4 , sodigoxin was held , with improving in pausing , but no change int-wave inversions. in discussions with his outpatientcardiologist , it was thought that his t-wave inversions couldpossible be ischemic , although the appropriate course of actionwas not to pursue further anticoagulation or evaluation forcatheterization , given the patient's other medical issues. hewas maintained on coumadin , aspirin , zocor , questran , andlopressor.b. rhythm: the patient continued to be in atrial fibrillationthroughout his hospitalization and was rate controlled withlopressor 37.5 mg t.i.d. ( increased from a home dose of 25 mgt.i.d. ). he was also maintained on coumadin 2 mg daily foranticoagulation. on admission , there was a report that he hadruns of ventricular tachycardia and he was placed on a lidocainedrip for several hours in the emergency department. nodocumentation regarding telemetry strips or qrs morphologiescould be obtained to verify this rhythm , however. in addition ,throughout his hospitalization , he had occasional runsnonsustained vt and svt. as discussed above , he was thought tohave mild digoxin toxicity given pausing with a digoxin level of1.3 to 1.4. his digoxin was therefore held and subsequentimprovement in pausing was noted. of note , on discharge , hisdigoxin has been discontinued. his primary care physician andcardiologist should consider whether or not to restart digoxin asan outpatient.c. pump: the patient was aggressively diuresed with 40 mg iv oflasix approximately one to two times per day , for a totaldiuresis of roughly negative 9 liters over the course of hishospitalization. echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of55-60% with left ventricular hypertrophy , consistent withdiastolic dysfunction. as discussed above , he will be dischargedon lasix 40 mg p.o. daily. note , as mentioned above , if he gainsgreater than 2 pounds over a 24-hour period , his lasix doseshould be doubled for that day.3. c. diff: the patient had a positive c. diff as an inpatient.he had been on flagyl , which was started at the nursing home fora prior diagnosis of c. diff. because of persistent bowelmovements , he was switched to p.o. vancomycin 250 mg q.i.d. , andupon discharge , he was started on a probiotic ( saccharomycesboulardii 250 mg q.i.d. ) to replenish his gut flora. we willrecommend that he continue p.o. vancomycin and the probiotic for10 days after his diarrheal symptoms have resolved. if thesesymptoms do not improve on the regimen within the few daysfollowing discharge from wood rehab , we will recommend consideradding metronidazole iv and getting an infectious diseaseconsult.4. diabetes: the patient had several bouts of hypoglycemiaduring the course of his hospitalization. these were appeared tobe related to poor p.o. intake. his lantus was changed to 15daily , and he was covered with a novolog sliding scale. afterthe changes , his fingersticks ranged in mid 100's.5. hypothyroidism: the patient's tsh was low with a normal freet4 suggestive of sick euthyroid. he was continued on synthroid25 mcg daily.6. musculoskeletal: given the patient's creatinine clearance ofless than 50 , his colchicine dose for gout was switched from 0.6mg b.i.d. to 0.6 mg daily. we continued his neurontin forneuropathic pain , and tylenol for right knee osteoarthritis. hewas seen by plastic surgery registered nurse who recommendedpanafil with dressing for his right heel ulcer. he also has asmall ulcer developing on his left big toe , which will need closeobservation as follow up.discharge medications:tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n. for headache , aspirin 81 mgdaily , questran 4 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily , nexium 20 mgdaily , lasix 40 mg daily , neurontin 100 mg q.a.m. and 200 mgq.p.m. , lantus 15 units subq at bedtime , synthroid 25 mcg p.o.daily , maalox one to two tablets p.o. q.6 h. , metoprolol 37.5 mgp.o. t.i.d. , panafil ointment topical twice b.i.d. , saccharomycesboulardii 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. , zoloft 50 mg q.a.m. , zocor 40 mg atbedtime , flomax 0.4 mg daily , vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.6 h. ,coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.p.m. , and iron sulfate 325 mg daily.escription document: 2-8888178 emssten teldictated by: filipovic , chanceattending: bliler , santiagodictation id 5669244d: 5/26/06t: 5/26/06
