[known lastname ] was admitted to the hospital, kept npo and hydratedwith iv fluids. based on his symptoms and anatomy, repair of hislarge paraesophageal hernia was recommended.  unfortunately hebecame delirious after having low dose ativan which was givenpreoperatively to reduce his anxiety.  he was taken to theoperating room for surgery on [2130-3-15] but immediately refusedthe surgery when he arrived in the operating room. he appearedconfused and delirious, the surgery was cancelled and hereturned to the floor.the psychiatry service evaluated him and felt that the confusionand delirium was prompted by ativan in combination with poornutritional status and his age. at that point the patient wantedsurgery again.  a decision was made to place a picc line andgive tpn for 4-5 days prior to operating with the attempt tohelp improve his nutritional status.  a picc line was placed on[2130-3-16] and tpn began.in the mean time he worked with physical therapy and had no moreepisodes of confusion or delirium.on [2130-3-20] he was taken to the operating room and underwent alaparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with peg tubeplacement. he tolerated the procedure well and returned to thepacu in stable condition.  he maintained stable hemodynamics andhis pain was well controlled.  following transfer to thesurgical floor he continued to make good progress.  his pain wascontrolled with tylenol alone and his mental status was intact.his tpn continued and eventually tube feedings were started andwell tolerated.  he was maintained on 2 cal hn 1 can tid.  histpn was weaned off [2130-3-23] and his picc line was removed.his chest xray on admission to the hospital was notable forbilateral pleural effusions but his respiratory status was notcompromised.  his effusions did increase in size and on [2130-3-23]he has a left thoracentesis for 1 liter of serosanguinous fluid. he tolerated it well and his subsequent chest xray demonstratedno pneumothorax and a clear diaphram.  he was breathingcomfortably off of oxygen and had room air saturations of 95%.he continued to work with physical therapy who recommended thathe go to a short term rehab prior to returning home to increasehis mobility and endurance.  from a surgical standpoint hecontinued to do well.  his post sites were healing well and hispeg site was dry.  after a long hospital stay he was dischargedto rehab on [2130-3-24].medications on admission:diltiazem er 360', ramipril 5', lovastatin 40', lasix 40', asa81', ? celebrex (unknown dose) -discharge medications:1. hydrocortisone 2.5 % cream sig: one (1) appl rectal [hospital1 ] prn() as needed for hemorrhoid pain.2. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: 5000 (5000)units injection [hospital1 ] (2 times a day).3. lasix 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.4. ramipril 5 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po once a day.5. diltiazem hcl 30 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qid (4times a day): hold for sbp < 100.6. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po tid (3times a day).7. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twice a day.8. milk of magnesia 400 mg/5 ml suspension sig: two (2) tbsp poat bedtime as needed for constipation.9. aspirin 81 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet, chewablepo once a day.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[location (un) 34004] nursing & rehabilitation center - [location (un) 14663]discharge diagnosis:giant paraesophageal hernia.delirium secondary to medicationssevere protein-calorie malnutritiondischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walkeror cane).discharge instructions:call dr.[name (ni) 5067] office [telephone/fax (1) 2348] if you experience:-fevers > 101 or chills-difficult or painful swallowing-nausea, vomiting-increased shortness of breathpain-take stool softners with narcotics-no driving while taking narcoticsactivity-shower daily. wash incision with mild soap and water, rinse,pat dry-no tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed-no lotions or creams to incision-walk 4-5 times a day for 10-15 minutes increase to a goal of 30minutes dailyfollowup instructions:department: hematology/oncologywhen: tuesday [2130-4-4] at 9:00 amwith: [first name11 (name pattern1) ] [last name (namepattern4) 3000], md [0-0-]building: sc [hospital ward name 23] clinical ctr [location (un) 24]campus: east     best parking: [hospital ward name 23] garageplease report 30 minutes prior to your appointment to theradiology department  on the [location (un) ] of the [hospital ward name 23] clinicalcenter for a chest xray.completed by:[2130-3-24]
