record date: 2065-02-04tribal internal medicine associates          hart, matthew                                              46103196                                              2-4-65   hpi:  the patient is a 41 year old man with a history of non-insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, obesity and substance abuse who i learned today was recently admitted for deep venous thrombosis and is presenting for follow up of his dvt.  the patient's current medical problems include:1.   recent dvt.  the patient was admitted between the days of 1-24 and      1-30 secondary to the development of a right lower extremity dvt.       the patient told me that he had been doing well and denied any      previous trauma to his leg or other predisposing factors such as long      car or airplane trips and he stated he had been as active as      previously over the recent few weeks.  the patient stated he awoke      in the morning of the 24th and noted tightness in his right      quadriceps and right calf.  he later developed progressive swelling      of the leg and therefore presented to the thd emergency      department.  he had lower extremity non-invasives performed which      confirmed the presence of a right lower extremity dvt.  he was      admitted and heparinized and then coumadinized prior to discharge.       the patient disclosed a history that his daughter had a dvt at the      time of her pregnancy and therefore a hypercoagulability work-up was      sent off which was negative.  the patient currently returns to me      complaining of further right calf pain and swelling.  he states that      he was interested in physical therapy but states that that did not      occur during his hospital course.  the patient was also angry and      upset that i had not visited him during his hospital stay.  i      explained to him that i had not been notified of his admission or of      his emergency department visit.  i called all of the parties      responsible for his admission to clear the confusion that had      occurred. 2.   hypertension.  the patient's previously been on anti-hypertensives      including lisinopril, unfortunately the patient has not tolerated ace      inhibitors secondary to a severe cough and therefore these were      discontinued recently.  with a discontinuation of his drinking, the      patient's blood pressures have been under much better control. 3.   adult onset diabetes mellitus.  i recently started the patient on      insulin.  he was scheduled for a follow up visit but unfortunately      did not make his visit.  his insulin dose was adjusted during his      recent hospitalization and his current dosage is 35 units of nph in      the morning and 15 units of regular.  in the evening he takes 10      units of nph and 10 units of regular.  the patient does not yet have      a home glucometer.  we will arrange for this. thd internal medicine associates          hart, matthewpage 2                                        46103196                                              2-4-65   physical examination:  vital signs showed a heart rate of 90.  blood pressure: 135/92. respiratory rate: 14 and unlabored.  heent: pupils equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear. mucous membranes moist. cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, normal s1, s2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  lungs: clear to ausculation. abdomen soft, nontender with active bowel sounds.  extremities:  there was notable edema of his right lower extremity with significant pain and a positive homan's sign.   impression:1)   dvt.  given his current physical examination, and lack of recent pt      check since time of discharge on the 30th, i am sending a stat pt.  i      encouraged the patient to elevate the leg. my feeling is that the dvt      has not successfully been treated and that likely his pt is not      therapeutic at the present time.  i have arranged for the patient to      follow up with aguilar, the internal medicine nurse, on wednesday for a repeat      check of his pt.  i left instructions that i should be called      immediately upon receiving the pt value, i also arranged for the      patient to meet with the physical therapist for the provision of a      cane to help with ambulation.  2)   adult onset diabetes.  i will recheck a hemoglobin a1c value at his      next office visit.  a finger stick in the office approximately three      hours after eating is 253.  i feel this is still too elevated.  i      will therefore adjust his insulin dose when i see him next week.  i      will follow up with the patient next week and make any necessary      adjustments in his medications at that time.   _________________________michael uecker, m.d.  pd:ud:1698dd:2-19-65dt:2-22-65dv:2-4-65
