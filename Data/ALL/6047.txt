the patient presented with hypotension with systolicsin the 70s-80s compared to his baseline of 120s-130s in theoutpatient setting.  his pressures did not respond adequately tofluid boluses.  a picc line was placed and he was started ondopamine initially.  dopamine was switched to vasopressin givenconcern for his recurrent ascites.  his shock was thought to bedue to a combination of sepsis and intravascular volumedepletion [3-3] recurrent malignant ascites. a definitiveinfectious source was never identified, though sbp was excludedwith 2 large volume paracenteses. the patient was placed onvancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. he was also given stress dosesteroids. fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid andcolloid without success. the patient continued to rapidlyreaccumulate fluid in his abdomen. the patient remained oliguricto anuric during his admission. norepinephrine was added on theday of intubation added without improvement in urine output.after a family meeting, the patient was made cmo and vasoactivemedications were discontinued. the patient expired shortlythereafter.# respiratory failure: the patient developed tachypnea andincreased work of breathing on the morning of his expirationwhile undergoing a ct head. he was intubated for respiratorydistress, self-extubated, and was reintubated for continuingrespiratory distress. versed, fentanyl, and propofol were usedfor sedation. a cxr did not show any acute intrapulmonaryprocess. bilateral lenis were negative for dvts.  an echo didnot show any rv strain.  most likely etiology was worsening lungfunction in the setting of extensive rcc lung metastases andworsening metabolic acidoses due to renal failure.  a familymeeting was held in the afternoon and the decision was made tomake him cmo given his poor prognosis.  the patient wasterminally extubated on the afternoon of [9-12] and expiredshortly thereafter.# acute renal failure: the patient was oliguric on presentation.a renal ultrasound did not show impaired renal flow. bladderpressures were consistently below 20.  etiology was likelysecondary to intraarterial volume depletion due to massive 3rdspacing of fluids secondary to ascites. urine output did notimprove after large volume paracentesis or after fluidresuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.  patient becameincreasingly acidemic.  dialysis was discussed and notconsidered appropriate given his poor prognosis.# metastatic renal cell carcinoma: the patient required 2 largevolume paracenteses to manage his malignant ascites. his painwas managed with a dilaudid pca.  patient's outpatientoncologist was contact[name (ni) ] and informed of worsening status andthe decision was made to not be aggressive with interventionsgiven his worsening prognosis and lack of tumor response tomultiple biologic therapies.# comfort care: patient's oncologist was contact[name (ni) ] regardingtransitioning to comfort care.  as noted above, his prognosiswas poor given his lack of response to biologic therapies.palliative care service was consulted.  patient's family wascalled on the day of intubation and arrived in the afternoon.discussion was had with the family as well as oncologist np andpalliative care and decision was made to terminally extubate.patient expired peacefully in the evening.medications on admission:preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.information
