diagnosis: atrial flutter.problems: coronary artery disease. new atrial fibrillation..history of present illness: mr. tarboro is a 50 year oldgentleman with a history of coronaryartery disease status post two vessel coronary artery bypass graft( cabg ) performed at hilltans spizee memorial medical center two weeks prior tohis admission. he presents with three days of palpitations. on26 of may , mr. almgren underwent cardiac catheterization which showed100% occlusion of the proximal lad and 70% occlusion of thecircumflex. he subsequently had a two vessel cabg at healtsa men'sas health center with attachment of the lima to the lad and the leftradial artery to the circumflex. postoperatively he went intoatrial fibrillation which later converted to normal sinus rhythm ,and he was discharged in stable condition on 0 of march on a medicalregimen of aspirin 325 mg q day , diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. to preventvasospasm of radial artery , atenolol 25 b.i.d. three days prior tothis admission , the patient noted palpitations of his heart withfluttering of the neck associated with clamminess and diaphoresis.he felt no chest pain , no nausea , vomiting , or shortness of breath ,but vna noted that his 150 beats per minute. the patient presentedto the navail hospital emergency room on 27 of february where ekg showedhim to be in atrial fibrillation alternating with atrial flutterwith a two-to-one block. an echocardiogram performed in theemergency room showed an ejection fraction of 54% with a mildpericardial effusion. by report from ties hospital , thepatient converted to normal sinus rhythm. he was sent home on hisprevious medical regimen of atenolol and aspirin with an increaseddose of diltiazem to 60 t.i.d. the patient felt well on dischargewith no chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , and nosyncope. laboratory studies in the lukes loton health services emergency room showedlow ck of 31 with troponin of 0.3 , magnesium 2.4. on the morningof admission , 10 of november , the patient noted palpitations again with arapid heart rate to 140 to 150. he presented to the pack general hospital emergency room. as previously , the patient deniedassociated symptoms of

showed a right pleural effusion but no evidence ofcongestive heart failure or infiltrate.ekg showed atrial fibrillation at 130 beats per minute. normalaxis with q waves in 3 , avf , v1 through v4. unchanged fromprevious ekg.calcium 8.7 with an albumin of 3.4.hospital course: the patient was treated with a medical regimen onadmission of increased atenolol to 50 b.i.d. ,continued diltiazem at 30 mg t.i.d. , continued aspirin. was loadedwith heparin bolus of 5000 , and loaded with procainamide at a rateof 750 mg q 6 hours. despite loading with procainamide for a totalof 5.25 grams over 36 hours , the patient maintained rhythm ofatrial flutter with two to one block throughout his hospital coursewith occasional variable conduction of three to one blockalternating with two to one block , occasional breaks to atrialfibrillation. an echocardiogram was performed in hospital on3 of october which showed an ejection fraction of 30% decreased from 45%on his last contisifoundt.warne kett hospital echocardiogram dated march , 1999.the echocardiogram from 3 of october also showed left ventricle normalin size with moderate concentric lvh , reduced lv function , leftatrium enlargement , with no evidence of thrombus. normal valveswith a small pericardial effusion. other causes for atrialfibrillation were considered. tsh came back normal at 3.1. newonset atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter was felt to beconsistent with pericardial inflammation post surgery. the patientwas maintained on procainamide throughout duration of stay. dosewas increased on 21 of october to procainamide sr 1000 mg q.i.d.however , this attempt at pharmacological cardioversion did notsucceed in attaining normal sinus rhythm. the patient waspresented with option of two to three weeks anticoagulation as anout patient with rate control on atenolol and diltiazem to befollowed by elective dc cardioversion at the end of three weeks.also discussed was the option of performing a transesophageal echofollowed by in house dc cardioversion. the patient and dr.pulkrabek chose the first option. the patient was started oncoumadin and attained inr of 1.7 by the day of discharge , 21 of aprilalthough patient had maintained atrial flutter rhythm throughouthospital stay , hemodynamically had been stable with pulse rangingbetween 76 to 110 with occasional tachycardia during activity andduring the morning hours ranging from 120 to 130. blood pressureranged between 90 to 110 systolic pressure. there was asignificant concern regarding the patient's decreased ejectionfraction to 30% from preoperative 45% , felt to be possiblysecondary to negative inotropic medications as well as atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response. however , could notrule out possibility of new infarct or ischemia causing decreasedlv function. in addition to his previous medications , the patientwas discharged on digoxin .25 mg q day and with instructions tofollow up with dr. riherd regarding his dose of procainamideas well as the possibility of adding a low dose ace inhibitor.patient will be followed by vna services and by anticoagulationservice managed by keith foy for inr monitoring and will returnto ertri brown memorial hospital in two to three weeks for elective dccardioversion.medications on discharge: aspirin 325 mg q day. atenolol 50 mgb.i.d. diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d.procainamide

patient will follow up with dr. scroggy onmonday , 4 of october , by phone regarding medication changesand will return to inhunt memorial medical in two to three weeksfor dc cardioversion.the patient and his wife will continue to monitor heart rate andblood pressure with home blood pressure cuff to follow vital signsand have been instructed to call dr. wainkrantz if heart rateexceeds 140 beats per minute or if patient experiences symptoms ofchest pain , shortness of breath , or increased palpitations , as wellas sign of blood in stools or excessive bruising.the patient was discharged to home with vna services in stablecondition.dictated by: rey vallarta , h.m.s.3attending: marcelo o. unterburger , m.d. my89ot096/2638batch: 55599 index no. burmb33p3m d: 7/14/99t: 10/13/99cc: 1. cleveland
