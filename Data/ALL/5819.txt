[known lastname ] to the or where the subduralbleed was drained; subsequent pathology demonstrated clottedblood.  he was kept in the neurosurgical icu for two days wherehe did well with no post-operative complications and was thensent back to the bone marrow unit for further care.  by hisreturn to bmt, his speech and confusion had greatly improved,and his family members agreed that he was back to his baseline.throughout the remainder of the admission, he continued toexperience a slight headache, much improved from admission, thatwas well relieved by 5mg of oxycodone.  his word-findingsymptoms did not recur.the main challenge was maintaining his platelets at a anappropriate level due to his underlying myelodysplasticsyndrome.  per the neurosurgery team, his goal for platelets wasaround 50 for three weeks; at the time of discharge, he willrequire an additional week of platelets at this level, usuallyachievable by giving two bags of platelets each morning,checking a post transfusion count 30-60 minutes thereafter.after this week has finished, he will be maintained at his priorlevel, getting transfusion two to three times per week at[hospital1 1388] hematology clinic under the care of dr. [first name (stitle) 1557].  he willfollow-up with his hematologist, dr. [first name (stitle) 1557], for his aml in oneweek and with dr. [last name (stitle) 739], a neurosurgeon, in two weeks(he will get a repeat ct scan at that time).2.)aml -- mr. [known lastname ] is being treated with hydroxyurea andtransfusions as needed.  his wbc at [hospital1 18] ranged between 12 and28, generally around 14.  his goal hematocrit was over 25, andhe generally required one unit of packed rbc's every three tofour days.  platelet requirements have been described above.3.)type two diabetes -- the prednisone mr. [known lastname ] takes makeshis blood sugars somewhat difficult to control, however, aregimen of humalog 75/25 with 45 units every morning and 25units at night seemed to work the best.  he was also coveredwith a routine regular insulin sliding scale for excessivelyhigh values (usually starting at 2 units of regular insulin fora glucose of 150-200, and going up by two units of insulin forevery 50mg/dl of blood glucose increase).4.)copd -- mr. [known lastname ] was maintained on advair 250/50, onepuff twice a day.  he was also given an albuterol inhaler forshortness of breath/wheezing that he rarely needed.  he becamewheezier in the middle of the admission, and was given twicedaily scheduled albuterol nebs to which he responded well.  wewould recommend continuing these for two more days, thenstopping them, leaving him on only advair and as neededalbuterol inhalers.5.)fever -- one week prior to discharge, mr. [known lastname ] had atemperature to 101.  his blood and urine cultures were negative. clinically and radiographically, his most likely source waspulmonary, although the chest x-ray did not demonstrate anobvious pneumonia.  he was treated with levofloxacin, and willfinish his course with seven more days of antibiotics.medications on admission:humalog 75/25 40 units sc every am and pmfurosemide 20mg po dailyadvair 250/50 one puff twice dailyhydroxyurea 1000mg po once dailypantoprazole 40mg po dailyprednisone 15mg po dailydischarge medications:1. humalog mix 75-25 75-25 unit/ml suspension sig: forty five(45) units subcutaneous qam.2. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) nebinhalation twice a day.disp:qs qs refills:23. fexofenadine hcl 60 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day).4. levofloxacin 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q24h (every24 hours) for 7 days.5. furosemide 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).6. fluticasone-salmeterol 250-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:one (1) puff inhalation [hospital1 ] (2 times a day).7. hydroxyurea 500 mg capsule sig: two (2) capsule po daily(daily).8. pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig:one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q24h (every 24 hours).9. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day).10. oxycodone hcl 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q4-6h(every 4 to 6 hours) as needed.11. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).12. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).13. heparin lock flush (porcine) 100 unit/ml syringe sig: two(2) ml intravenous  daily (daily) as needed. ml14. humalog mix 75-25 75-25 unit/ml suspension sig: twenty (20)units subcutaneous qpm.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital1 700] - [location (un) 701]discharge diagnosis:primary:subdural hematomoasecondary:acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromediabetes -- type twocopddischarge condition:fair, with improved sx, stable hematoma, requiring frequentplatelet transfusions.discharge instructions:please return to the emergency department for fevers/chills,shortness of breath, chest pain, severe headaches, confusion,speech difficulties.follow up as below.take medications as prescribed.followup instructions:you have an appointment with dr.
