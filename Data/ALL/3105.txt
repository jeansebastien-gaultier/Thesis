withimprovement of her hct from 13.6 on admission to 23.2. shedeveloped respitratory distress likely secondary to combinedinsult of her pneumonia and volume overload for which shetriggered. she was found to be in flash pulmonary edema. shereceived supportive therapy. her respiratory status improved andshe was transferred to the floor. she was started on albuterolnebulizer treatement for possible bronchospasm, but this may notneed to be continued at the rehabilitation facility..pna/recurrent fevers: she had presented to clinic where she wasfound to be febrile to 102 and neutropenic. a cxr showed a leftlower lobe pneumonia. she was started on vancomycin andcefepime. a dfa was negative. blood cultures were negative. inthe interim, the patient was managed with meropenem,voriconazole, azithromycin, and vancomcyin in the setting ofrecurrent fevers and night sweats. she was discharged afterbeing afebrile for 1-2 days, with a short course of meropenem tobe completed..mds/anemia: she has a history of sideroblastic anemia for whichshe is on azacitidine. she received 5 units of prbc over thefirst 2 days of her hospitalization. there was a consideration,given the recurrent fevers and night sweats, that the patienthad a hematologic etiology, perhaps transformation to aml.  asmear was obtained and was unremarkable, so bone marrow biopsywas deferred. she received a unit of prbc on

alsodeveloped attention/cognitive deficits. an mr head was obtainedwhich showed a likely watershed infarct in the left frontalcortex, with multiple focal lesions in both hemispheres. lp wasnegative for meningitis. tte bubble study was negative for pfoor asd. eeg was performed with results pending at time ofdischarge. her mental status improved considerably and she had aclear thought process, and

ofdischarge..neutropenic fever: her neutropenia was likely secondary to herchemotherapy. she was placed on neutropenic precautions and heranc was trended.  her neutropenia resolved with periodic dosingof neupogen. she had had no fevers for 1-2 days prior todischarge. per id recommendations, she was discharged onmeropenem, to be continued for six days following discharge..prophylaxis: she did not receive heparin sq prophylacticallygiven the contraindication posed by her azacitidine therapy.  asher platelet count remained normal, and there was no evidence ofintracranial hemorrhage on
