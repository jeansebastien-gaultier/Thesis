bowel sounds are present throughout.  extremities reveal no     edema.  there were chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally and ecchymosis     on the left side of her foot.  pulses were 2+ and symmetric.          neurological exam: the patient has significant weakness of the bilateral     lower and upper extremities with -4/5 strength of the hands and 2+ strength     in the hip flexors, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, calf, and anterior     tibialis.          laboratory data: on admission, white count 7700, hematocrit 30.3, platelets     443,000.  inr 1.4, potassium 4.0, creatinine 0.8, cpk and troponin were     negative x3.  ekg showed normal sinus rhythm without changes of ischemia.     chest x-ray revealed no congestive heart failure or pneumonia.  her     adenosine sestamibi stress test revealed no evidence of ekg or reversible     perfusion defects.  she did have evidence of a fixed defect in the inferior     heart with hypokinesis, with an lvef of 75%.  ct of chest with a pe     protocol did not reveal any thrombus.          hospital course: the patient was seen in consultation by dr. yonathan orth     of general surgery.  the patient had expressed an interest in considering     colectomy after initially refusing colectomy since january 2095.     initially, this was due to concerns about possible transfusion needs during     surgery.  after extensive     conversations with dr. orth and with her family, and with the patient,     i believe that the comorbidities associated with the surgery and     perioperative healing, far outweigh any potential benefits that she may     have from this potential surgery and therefore we collectively decided not     to pursue this.          chest pain: the patient had no evidence of ischemia by cardiac biomarkers.     adenosine sestamibi did not reveal any reversible defects.  she will     continue to be treated with antihypertensives.  her chest wall pain is     likely due to esophageal spasm.          gastrointestinal: her esophageal spasms and gerd will be treated with ppi.          chronic pain syndrome: she has chronic pain from osteoarthritis and     fibromyalgia.  this has led to debilitating weakness in upper or lower     extremities and reliance upon chronic pain medications. at the time, we     will continue pain medications for her comfort.  continue aggressive bowel     regimen.          feeding: the patient needs a soft mechanical diet in order to allow her to     eat and masticate as she has no dentures at present.  the family currently     working to try to obtain dentures for her.          resuscitation status: per the patient's wishes, after extensive     conversation with family and patient, she does not desire heroic     intervention and is do not resuscitate and do not intubate.          discharge medications: prilosec 20 mg p.o. daily, tylenol 650 mg p.o.     p.r.n., vitamin c 500 mg p.o. daily, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, colace 100     mg b.i.d., epogen 4000 units 3 times a week, ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.     daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily,     milk of magnesia daily p.r.n. constipation, megestrol acetate suspension     200 mg p.o. daily to terminate on 07/15/2095, metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,     mirtazapine 15 mg p.o. at bedtime, multivitamins 1 p.o. daily, oxycodone     p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, zocor 20 mg p.o. daily, zinc sulfate 220 mg p.o.     daily, methadone 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.          disposition: the patient will be transferred back to the mcdonough county rehabilitation center.                              yonathan oliver turk, m.d.     dictating for:          electronically signed     yonathan oliver turk, m.d. 08/14/2095 10:33
