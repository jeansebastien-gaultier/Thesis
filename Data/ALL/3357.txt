comminuted right tibial and fibularfracture.brief hospital course:pt was seen and resuscitated in the trauma bay. his primarysurvey was unremarkable and secondary survey revealed a nearlyamputated rle at the level of the ankle/mid tibia, as well astwo lacerations on the lue, each approx 5-6cm. orthopedics andplastic surgery were consulted to the trauma bay for managementof these two injuries respectively. he required one unit prbcsduring his resuscitation. the patient did still have adopplerable pulse in the rle, and was taken immediately to theor for preliminary stabilization of the associated fractures inan attempt to salvage this extremity. his forearm lacerationswere repaired concurrently.  the patient was followed for theseinjuries and admitted to the trauma service for management. hewas progressing well with an open right tib fib injury that hadalready been stabilized, but continued to have unstablehematocrits, requiring multiple additional transfusions. nosource outside of the rle could be identified, so the bleedingwas assumed to be from his lower extremity injuries.during the patients recovery on the floor he developed acutemental status changes . a head ct was obtained with no acutechanges. he was given haldol for agitation and acutely developedfever to 103f. a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome waspresumed and he was transferred to the sicu for management. hewas also noted with high urine output and hypernatremia; of notehe has a history of bipolar disorder and has been on lithium.psychiatry became involved and his lithium and other psychiatricmeds were withheld. his na did normalize and was 141 at time ofdischarge. his psychiatric meds were recommended to be slowedrestarted. all of his other potentially offending medicationswere held and he was followed in the icu until his feversresolved and his mental status improved.following this, the patient was transferred to the floor forfurther management. he was evaluated by psychiatry forrecommendations regarding his home psych meds and they wereresumed at lower doses in order to assess his response. at timeof this dictation he is tolerating these initial doses andshould be increased to his home dose once continued stabilizedwhile at rehab.he did have significant pain control issues requiring initiallyhigher doses of his narcotics. he was started on methadone 10 mg[hospital1 ] to manage his acute pain issues and is also receivingdilaudid po prn for breakthrough pain.he was evaluated by physical therapy and is being recommendedfor rehab after his acute hospital stay.medications on admission:lithiumpercocetdischarge medications:1. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) adhesive patch, medicated sig:one (1) adhesive patch, medicated topical daily (daily)
