2 635 , and cpk # 3 461 .mb fractionations of the cpks were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .4. gastroenterology :gi was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .upper endoscopy x 2 were done .the first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .the stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .it was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible mallory-weiss tear .a second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .a gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .this report needs to be followed up , and will be available at bri health in the pathology department some time within the next three to seven days .the patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a gi follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .i have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , dr. fordwoodall stick , in ranegei pkwy , verertliet , south carolina 62156 .the patient is to arrange follow up with a gi doctor in jotar boulevard , cunahtampfordama , south dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .the patient was initially on cimetidine and carafate here at bri health , and then switched to prilosec 20 mg bid .5. pulmonary :the patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .incentive spirometry was started .albuterol and atrovent nebulizers were done .the patient received chest physical therapy bid .6. endocrine :the patient needs still better diabetes control .he has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating pringle &apos;s in the room ) .his nph was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with czi sliding-scale coverage .7. infectious disease :the patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , ph 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .however , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .a repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .8. renal :after the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .he was given lasix 40 mg iv x 1 and also had nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .the patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.his bun/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .9. hematology :the patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .the patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .the patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .fen :repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .the patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
