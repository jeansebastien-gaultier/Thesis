hedeveloped stomach upset , diarrhea , dry heaves , and a dry cough. hedenied recent travels , and had remote abx use. at stodun hospital ,he had 5.5 liters removed and afterwards his bp was 66/30. 1

hypoxia is likely from mild pulm edema.although chronically elevated cardiac enzymes , there is concern aboutnew ishemia , and concern for pe given hypoxia in ed.hospital course1. cvs: ischemia: nstemi: contined medical management with asa , betablocker , imdur , zocor , ntg prn. the ckmb peaked at 12 and tni to 4. hiscardiologist ( dr benisek ) recommended pet scan to assess for viablemyocardium and ischemia. his last stress test 1 year ago showed onlyscarring with no ischemia. in the past , pt's wife refused for him to gofor cabg. they are reconsidering this option currently.the results of the pet scan are as follows:- a small region of myocardial scar/hibernation along with mildresidual stress induced peri-infarct ischemia in the distal laddistribution.- moderate global lv systolic dysfunction.- the results are essentially unchanged from his prior study of february ,2003.the family was called to stress the importance of follow up withcardiology ( they have missed appointments in the past )pump: ( ef 20-25% ) , increased enalapril to 10mg bid , bnp was sent andpending and echo revealed ef 30% , mod ai.rhythm: no events occurred on telemetry2. pulm: monitored sats with fluid restriction. ra sats improved to97%3. renal: hd mwf , home renal meds. he was dialyzed to a weight belowhis previous baseline per cardiology recommendations. in the past hehas had elevated rh filling pressures after hd. the ryi wascalled by the attendting renal physician ( dr. slemp ) about his goalweight.4. id: blood cx were no growth5. gi: he was continued on his

medications listed above and do not take enalapril onmornings of dialysisplease adhere to your dietary restrictions. if you gain more than 3 kgbetween dialysis sessions please restrict your fluid
