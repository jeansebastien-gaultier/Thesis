first in june when she was diagnosed with hocm and then in july when she was started on empiric steroids for sarcoidosis.  she says her appetite has never returned to normal since her surgery (although her july admission note also documented malaise and poor appetite) and that she has had some mild nausea on a daily basis since her surgery.  the nausea and her fatigue became worse four or five days prior to admission and since then she has been vomiting many times a day.  the nausea is not related to meals and she has not noted any blood in the emesis.  she has had poor intake as a result of the nausea and has only had broth over the last few days.  she denies fevers, chills, headaches, cough, abdominal pain, or change in the character of her colostomy output.  ed course:  on arrival to the ed, vitals were as follows: 98, 164/84, 84, 24, 98%/ra.  her abdomen was non-tender and minimally distended.  ct of the abdomen was concerning for a distal small bowel obstruction although no focal transition point was identified.  she was seen by surgery and an ngt was placed.  she was given 2l of ivf and morphine 2mg iv x2.   rosas above, otherwise reports baseline blurry vision (has been told of cataracts in the past). denies sob, cough, cp, chest pressure, orthopnea, palpitations.foley catheter in place but denies suprapubic tenderness.  medical history-          pe: saddle embolus 11/17, s/p ivc filter, on coumadin-          lupus anticoagulant positive-          htn-          hocm: diagnosed 6/97-          sarcoidosis: empirically started on prednisone 7/97 in the setting of hypercalcemia-          pbc: +ama, not confirmed on biopsy-          urge incontinence, rectocele, bladder prolapse -          h/o paf -          dmsurgical history-                 10/18/97: perforated diverticulitis, s/p ex lap, hartmanns procedure, small bowel resection and mobilization of left colon -                 multiple ln biopsiesfamily history three children with dm.social historyoriginally from .  widowed 42 years, 4 children, 4 grandchildren.  works in tlc as a nurse.  no tobacco/alcohol/drugs.  allergies:  nkdamedications on admission:  1. acetaminophen (tylenol  )  650 mg po q4h prn    2. albuterol inhaler (albuterol mdi )  4 puff inh q2h prn bronchospasm  3. albuterol nebulizer  2.5 mg qid  4. aluminum/magnesium hydroxide +  simethicone (maalox susp)  15-30 ml po q6h prn gi upset/heartburn  5. amiodarone  200 mg qd  6. ascorbic acid  500 mg bid  7. bisacodyl (dulcolax )  10 mg po qd prn constipation  8. clopidogrel (plavix )  75 mg qd  9. docusate sodium (colace )  100 mg bid10. ferrous sulfate  325 mg qd11. furosemide (lasix )  20 mg qod12. insulin regular inj  sliding scale sc                 if bs &lt;= 200 give 0 units                 for bs from 201 to 250 give 4 units                 for bs from 251 to 300 give 6 units                 for bs from 301 to 350 give 8 units                 for bs from 351 to 400 give 10 units 13. ipratropium inhaler  4 puff inh q2h prn bronchospasm14. magnesium oxide   400 mg bid15. metoprolol tartrate (lopressor )  100 mg q8h16. mirtazapine  7.5  mg qhs17. omeprazole  20 mg bid18. ondansetron odt (chemo n/v) (zofran odt (chemo n/v))  4 mg po q8h prn nausea19. oxycodone  5-10 mg po q6h prn pain20. pentoxifylline (trental)   400 mg tid21. prednisone  5 mg qd22. quetiapine (seroquel)   25 mg po bid prn agitation23. sennosides (senna tablets)  2 tab po qhs prn constipation24. simethicone  160 mg tid25. spironolactone (aldactone )  25 mg qd26. verapamil hcl  60 mg tid27. warfarin sodium (coumadin )  5 mg qpmphysical examvitals:  99.1, 95, 132/86, 97%/ragen&#8217;l    pleasant african-american woman, tired but nad, heent   dry mucous membranes, ngt in place, op clear, +conjunctival pallor neck     supple, no lad, jvp&lt;5 cm, no carotid bruits heart rrr, normal s1, s2, 3/6 sem louder at base and increases in harshness with valsalvalung     ctab, no rhonchi, rales abd       +bs, soft, non-tender, non-distended, midline incisional wound with dry, sterile dressing, colostomy bag in llq with brown stoolext        r le with dry sterile dressing over shin, 2+ dp pulse, wwp;
