expired.69 yo f with metastatic breast cancer prsents with vomitting,poor po intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure withhyponatremia.  was tachycardic and complaining of mild chesttightness.  admitted to the icu for tachycardia andhyponatremia, then to the oncology floor.  see below fordiscussion of each issue..goals of care: meeting in icu regarding goals of care and poorprognosis, then reiterated on the oncology medicine floor:code: dnr/i (discussed with patient and hcp), and daughter hcp[name (ni) ] [telephone/fax (1) 80568]. focus on comfort with symptom management.avoidance of invasive procedures, per family (son, daughter,sister).[name2 (ni) ] died the morning after being transferred to the icu..# altered mental status: patient does not respond to verbal orvisual stimuli on the floor. likely d/t progressive metastaticdisease, combined with renal failure, hypotension, pain, sbpinfection, delirium. pain controlled with iv morphine prn,treated sbp with ceftriaxone, palliative care following..# chest pain: unclear etiology, seemed to be costrochondritisrelated as the pain was reproducible. ruled out for mi withthree sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  a v/q of her chest wasordered to rule out pe, but the patient was unable to lie flatand complete the exam so it was aborted. held anticoagulationd/t goals of care, no cta given arf, could not tolerate v/qscan. on the floor, patient unable to verbalize whether chestpain still present. pain medications provided..# hypotenion/tachycardia: likely was related to underlyingcancer and hypovolemia.  was volume resuccitated with ns and thelr while in the icu for the first two days.  she was offerred acvl in the ed and declined.  her bp improved to sbps in the 90s,then 100s with ivfs and remained stable.  initially she seemedfluid responsive with a decrease in rate from 130s to 110s(which seemed to be her baseline).  she remained tachycardic onday two of admission without an obvious cause as she seemedmostly fluid repleted.  we continued to bolus her and pursued afurther workup for pe.  initially she had negative lenis and act was deferred because of arf.  a v/q scan was performed on[2179-3-10], but she was unable to lie flat for the test and thetest could not be completed.  she was bolused periodicallyovernight to maintain map of over 65.  her tachycardia improvedwith ivf boluses prn..# hyponatremia/acute renal failure: based on exam and history,likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. most likely gi losses combinedwith third spacing in the setting of ascites. with fluidresuccitation, she corrected and normalized very quickly but didnot have any neurological changes.  she did have a ct head inthe ed that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.  herarf also improved with ivfs and her urine output remained briskthroughout her hospitalization..# thrush: likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting.started swish and swallow for her comfort..# breast cancer: mid-cycle in her avastin and navelbine.  ismetastatic and has recurrent ascites requiring taps.  onpresentation, her abdomen was soft and a therapeuticparacentesis was deferred because of her hypovolemia, moderatehypotension and neutropenia.  oncology was consulted andfollowed along.  patient to oncology floor, outpatient oncologyattending described poor prognosis. family meeting regardingpoor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have furtherchemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures..# leukopenia: likely chemo related, as last dose was [3-1].
