admission date :2016-03-30discharge date :2016-04-03service :ccuhistory of present illness :this is a 64-year-old female with a history of hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , and dilated cardiomyopathy ( with a transthoracic echocardiogram in 2016-01-13 showing an ejection fraction of 40% , posterior and inferior apical akinesis , and large left ventricular thrombus ).the patient was admitted from 2016-01-21 to 2016-02-03 ; at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .she had a cardiac catheterization which revealed 3-vessel disease with normal left main , mid left anterior descending artery 60% , diffuse 90% mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal , serial 70% and 90% left circumflex lesions , and 90% first obtuse marginal , and mid right coronary artery 60% .during initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the right coronary artery stenosis was found ; for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent .she was discharged on coumadin for a goal inr of 2.5 to 3 .she was then admitted again on 2016-03-30 for an elective coronary artery bypass graft .at surgery , the descending aorta was noted to be calcified , and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intra-aortic pedunculated lesion .given the elevated stroke risk of aortic cross-clamping in the setting of this finding , the plan for a bypass graft was aborted .the patient was then transferred to the coronary care unit service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission .hospital course :the patient is a 64-year-old female with 3-vessel disease who was admitted to the coronary care unit service for western mass . hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted .the patient was continued on aspirin , plavix , and statin .once the patient was titrated off dopamine , the beta blocker and ace inhibitor were restarted .with regard to the left ventricular thrombus , her goal inr remained 2.5 to 3 ; and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tubestandpoint .the patient remained comfortable .by 04-01 , on postoperative day two , the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued .the patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place .likewise , on 04-01 , the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty .thus , the beta blocker and ace inhibitor were started to be titrated up .in addition , the patient was started on wellbutrin for smoking cessation .at this point , it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup .the patient did well and was transferred to the floor on 04-02 .after evaluation and a discussion with dr. gunter , it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque , and there was no anterior/apical akinesis noted .at this point , the left ventricular thrombus ( for which she was initially started therapy for ) was no longer present .the patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for a goal hematocrit of greater than 30 .by 04-03 , captopril and atenolol were started , and the patient 's leg bandage from the vein harvest was removed .the patient continued to do well on the medical regimen and was without chest pain , shortness of breath , or any other symptoms .
