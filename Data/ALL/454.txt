lipitor ; cardura ; plavix ; lasix ; cozaar ; procardia .physical examination :he was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .jvp was not raised .his cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal s1 , s2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .his abdominal examination was benign .lungs were clear .his ekg at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged pr interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of wenckebach .his ekg also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow av nodal re-entrant tachycardia .impression :patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an avnrt .he was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .it was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .hospital course :the patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .his baseline tracings showed evidence of a high av block with av wenckebach at 550 ms.he had evidence of avnrt , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .the patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .the procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .on the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .this was a medtronic sigma sdr 303 type pacemaker .his atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .the atrial measurements were as follows :amplitude 5.6 to 8 mv , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .his ventricular measurements were as follows :rv amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .the patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .a chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a cat scan after discharge to follow up on this .after discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the cat scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial cat scans if there was a need for the same .the patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .he has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .discharge medications :his medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .he is being discharged on :1. lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.2. plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.3. lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.4. cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.5. procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.6. cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.7. isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.8. detrol 5 mg p.o. t.i.d.9. atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.ill kihdaiz , mddictating for :electronically signed lenni e n kanner , m.d. 01/10/2003 22:16 _____________________________ lenni e n kanner , m.d.tr :lhtdd :12/26/2002td :12/27/2002 6:24 a 974151cc :lenni e n kanner , m.d. ill kihdaiz , m.d.
