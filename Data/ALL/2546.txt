exercisetolerance testing that elicited 2 mm diffuse st depression as wellas a drop in systolic blood pressure and chest pain after 5minutes of exercise. he was referred for cardiaccatheterization , which revealed 80% left main , 80% om1 , 80%diagonal 1 , and 70% serial lad lesions as well as an 80% lplv ,and 70% rca. he was referred for surgical revascularization.past medical

cellcount of 6 , hematocrit of 36 , and inr of 1.1.ekg: normal sinus rhythm at 47 with st elevations in v2 and v3and biphasic t waves and avl. chest x-ray is normal.hospital course:the patient was admitted on 8/24/06 and underwent cardiaccatheterization with results as previously described. he alsounderwent echocardiogram on 11/8/06 , which estimates ejectionfraction at 60% and finds trivial mitral insufficiency , trivialtricuspid insufficiency , and mild left atrial enlargement. thepatient was taken to the operating room on 10/13/06 where heunderwent cabg x5 with lima to lad and a sequential graft of svg1connecting the aorta to pda and then lvb1. left radial arteryconnects to d1 and then om1. the patient was taken to theintensive care unit following surgery in stable condition. hewas extubated later on his operative day and was noted to have aslightrise in his mb fraction. he was started on dopamine onpostoperative day #2 for low blood pressure and low urine outputas well as rising creatinine. his ck-mb was noted to have peakedand was trending down. postoperative day #3 , the patient wasweaned off of dopamine and his creatinine began totrend down. on postoperative operative day 4 , the patient wasoff all drips making good urine and given 1 unit of packed redblood cells for a low hematocrit. he was transferred to thestep-down unit later that day. at time of transfer , he washemodynamically stable and had been started on diltiazem forspasm prophylaxis of his radial artery graft. the plan was toavoid hypotension for renal perfusion and up titratebeta-blockade carefully. he was saturating well on room air andhis diet was being advanced and was well tolerated. hiscreatinine had fallen at time of transfer to 1.6 from its peak of2.4 and continued to improve to its baseline levels by time ofdischarge. the patient was followed perioperatively by thediabetes management service for glycemic control. he continuedto progress daily , remained in sinus rhythm and on room air forthe duration of his stay. his creatinine remained at baselinelevel of 1.6. he continued to ambulate without problems andwas discharged home in good condition on postoperative day #7 onthe following medications: diltiazem 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. to becontinued for three months postoperatively for radial arterygraft , colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.
