edcomplaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain. she wasinitially admitted to the micu for hypertensive urgency and thentransfered to the floor after a day.# hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ed,but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her bp wascoming down too fast).  she was started on her home meds andtolerated these fairly well.  transferred to the floor and notedto have spbs in the 90s.  she required 1l ivf bolus since herbaseline sbp is thought to run in the 130-170 range.  she alsohad transient dizziness during this episode.  bp meds were heldand later that night her sbp was in the 220s.  bp medsrestarted.  she remained stable thereafter with sbps in the130-170s.  we opted to discharge her on her home regimen(without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issueswith elevated blood pressures..# right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fractureon plain film. mri and plain films were ordered and showed noacute pathology.  the pain was in the distribution of her righthamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggestinga muscle injury.  ck was normal.  pain was treated with dilaudidinitially.  on

with right leg pain and poorly controlledhypertension.  your blood pressure was controlled initially withiv medications then your home medications.  since your bloodpressure was occasionally low, we

finding a cause.  we suspect a hamstring injurygiven its location.  please take pain medications if needed.  werecommend followup with physical therapy.you also had a fever which is suggestive of infection.  wetreated you with cipro in case you had a uti.  otherwise, yourcultures were unrevealing.we attempted peritoneal dialysis but this was unsuccessful.please followup with your
