after a fascial dehiscencestatus post subtotal colectomy. she was originally admitted tothe outside hospital on 10/28/05 with abdominal pain. the ctscan showed free air. she also had acute renal failure with acreatinine of 1.8. she was taken to the operating room where sheunderwent exploratory laparotomy and where she was found to havea mid descending colonic perforation secondary to diverticulitis.she underwent a partial left colectomy and end colostomy withhartmann's pouch. she was placed on clindamycin and levofloxacinpostoperatively. she was extubated on postoperative day #3. shehad persistent elevated white blood cell count for which theychanged antibiotics to flagyl and fluconazole. a ct scanrevealed questionable dehiscence of her abdominal wound and abinder was placed. she was subsequently found to be c. diffpositive. she was reintubated for respiratory distress onpostoperative day #7 along with decreased blood pressures andincreased white blood cell count. she was started onhydrocortisone and pressors were also started. she was extubatedon postoperative day #13 and was started on p.o. medssubsequently. she was started on her home bipap settings. sheis also started on diltiazem drip for her paroxysmal atrialfibrillation. she was transferred over to the vau haain medical center for surgical intervention of her abdominal wounddehiscence.past medical history:1. morbid obesity.2. copd , on home o2 and bipap sittings 15/10.3. hypercholesterolemia.4. obstructive sleep apnea.5. paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.6. coronary artery disease - echo dated

seroquel.cardiovascular: the patient remained hemodynamically stableafter her initial septic event. she remained in a normal sinusrhythm for the remainder of her icu course. she was maintainedon lopressor 100 per per g-tube q.i.d. her pressures toleratedthis dose.pulmonary: the patient continued on bipap failing each trial offthe bipap. she would become tachypneic and desaturate withelevation of her pco2 once off bipap. after several days offbipap trials , the decision was made and discussed with the familyand the patient regarding her need for tracheostomy. it wasexplained to her that tidal volumes were low and would drop offbipap and that she would benefit from a tracheostomy placement.the patient was consented and informed and taken to the operatingroom on 4/0/06 where she underwent a tracheostomy. shetolerated the procedure well. she was quickly weaned to pressuresupport ventilation. she was maintained on minimal vent settingsfor a couple of days postoperatively. she

ventilation.the patient has also had some mild bilateral pleural effusion onchest x-ray that has not progressed and has been stablethroughout her course. the patient has a history of obstructivesleep apnea and copd at baseline. the patient received inhalerand nebulizers standing and p.r.n. she will need to continue hertrach collar trials most likely having more trach collar trialsat smaller intervals. the patient's current vent settings upondischarge to rehabilitation are pressure support 5 and 10 , tidalvolumes 350-400 , breathing at a rate of 23 , and saturating 99% onan fio2 of 40%.gi: patient's abdomen remained stable with a vac sponge. shehad her vac sponge changed as needed twice a week with goodgranulation tissue forming. there were no signs of infection.due to the patient's respiratory failure and need fortracheostomy , patient also underwent a peg placement on 6/10/06 . she tolerated this procedure well. medications were started onthe day of surgery and her tube feeds were resumed onpostoperative day #1 from her peg. the patient is currentlyreceiving two cal formula tube feeds at a rate of 45 , which isher goal rate. she should continue on that. the patient may bechanged to jevity if she needs more fluid volume. the patient'sabdomen is soft , vac sponge in place to suction and draining ,ostomy is functioning well and viable with good output. thepatient should continue on a h2 blocker for a ppi while on thevent.gu: the patient is still somewhat fluid overloaded most likelydue to third spacing due to poor nutrition andhyperprolactinemia.
