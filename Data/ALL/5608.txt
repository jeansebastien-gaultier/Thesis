illness: the patient is a 52-year-old man withischemic cardiomyopathy , estimated ef15-20% who presents with an 8-10 pound weight gain over the past3-5 days , increased fatigue. also reports increased shortness ofbreath which has progressed over the past few months and notes thathe now gets shortness of breath after walking as few as 10-20steps. he also complains of lightheadedness but denies chest pain ,palpitations. he also complains of occasional sweats and chillswithout nausea , diarrhea , constipation , melena , or bright red bloodper rectum. he reports that lately his blood sugars have beenlower than usual , in the 40s-80s. denies orthopnea , pnd , or lowerextremity edema. denies dietary indiscretions or medicalnoncompliance. however , there is a recent history of discontinuingcertain medications and the patient is unclear to which medicationshe should actually be taking at this point.past medical history: coronary artery disease status postmyocardial infarction in 1979 and 1985 ,status post three-vessel cabg in 1987 , ischemic cardiomyopathy ,estimated ejection fraction 15-20% , cardiac cirrhosis ,hypothyroidism , nephrolithiasis , gallstones , irritable bowelsyndrome , psoriasis.allergies: he has no known allergies.medications on admission: torsemide , synthroid 100 mcg p.o.q.d.;lantus 98 units subcu q. a.m.; potassium60 meq p.o. b.i.d.; humalog insulin 12 units subcu q. a.m. and q.p.m.; restoril 30 mg p.o. q.h.s.; xanax p.r.n.; prozac 40 mg p.o.q. a.m.; lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s.; digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d.;captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; aldactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. per patienthis digoxin , captopril and aldactone have been on hold. apparentlythese were held after a clinic visit on 1/23/02 via dr. mcmeanswhen the patient was complaining of orthostatic symptoms and historsemide was held over the past five days prior to admission.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 96.8 , heart rate72 , blood pressure 91/63 , breathing 95% onroom air. general: this is a comfortable , pleasant gentleman inno acute distress. alert and oriented x 3. heent: normocephalic ,atraumatic. pupils equal , round and reactive to light andaccommodation. extraocular movements intact. moist mucousmembranes. neck: jvp estimated at 12 cm/water. lungs: decreasedbreath sounds at bases , otherwise clear to auscultation.cardiovascular: normal s1s2. regular rate and rhythm. no heartsounds. no murmurs , rubs or gallops appreciated. abdomen: soft ,nontender , obese. extremities: warm , no clubbing , cyanosis oredema. 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.laboratory data: creatinine 1.2 , troponin-i 0.06.electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm at 67 beats/minute , firstdegree av block , left axis deviation , right bundle branch block. qwaves in ii , iii and avf consistent with old inferior infarct. allthese findings unchanged from the prior ekg in 2/14admission diagnoses:1. ischemic cardiomyopathy.2. congestive heart failure.3. volume overload.4. diabetes mellitus.5. hypothyroidism.hospital course: 1 ) cardiovascular: the patient on admission wasclinically volume overloaded. he was diuresedwith torsemide iv boluses with good response. he was diuresing twoliters negative per day on torsemide iv or p.o. as well asspironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. however , his clinical volume statuswere difficult to assess and accordingly on 8/12/02 he underwentright heart catheterization and tailored therapy. by report hisright atrial pressure on right heart catheterization was 17 , hiswedge pressure was 43 and pulmonary artery pressure was 65/37indicating that he still has substantial volume overload. ontherapy his vasodilators were cautiously added to decrease hissystemic vascular resistance and total vascular resistance withsuccess with low doses of captopril. his pa catheter wasdiscontinued on 6/24/02. he has continued to be diuresed withtorsemide 10 p.o. b.i.d. , spironolactone 25 mg p.o.q.d. he shouldbe at or near euvolemia on 11/10/02 and he was discharged on adiuretic regimen of torsemide 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. and spironolactone25 mg p.o.q.d. in addition to captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.ischemia: there were no ischemic issues during this hospitaladmission.rhythm: electrocardiogram with first degree av block. the patientwas monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital course. noevidence of significant arrhythmias were noted. no further workupwas pursued from a rhythm standpoint.2 ) endocrine: the patient had a history of hypothyroidism. it isunclear how this came to be but at some point in the past hissynthroid had been stopped and only relatively recently restarted.he had been maintained at a dose of 225 mcg q.d. in the past. whenhe was restarted on synthroid by the outpatient endocrinologist ,dr. escudero , his synthroid was started at a relatively low dose andtitrated slowly upwards because of his severe cardiomyopathy andthere was concern that increasing his dose too quickly wouldprecipitate angina. on admission his tsh was 50 and after somediscussion with dr. pimpare his synthroid was increased to 125 mcgp.o.q.d. on 9/22/02 an endocrine consult was requested because on7/30/02 his repeat tsh of 75.8 , t4 of 6.5 and a thbr of 1.10.endocrine consult recommended increasing synthroid to 150 mcgp.o.q.d. and slowly titrating synthroid upwards by no more than 25mcg q. 3-4 weeks to a goal of 200 mcg per day , again slowlytitrating upwards to reduce the risk of precipitating angina.further management of his hypothyroidism could be done on anoutpatient basis.the patient also on admission had a history of type ii diabetesmaintained on insulin. his insulin doses had been titrateddownwards during his hospital diabetes mellitus because of lowfingersticks , likely secondary to a relatively healthy diet whilein the hospital. he required only 60 units of lantus insulin q.a.m. he was discharged on that dose with humalog 10 units subcu q.a.m. and q. p.m. to be followed and possibly titrated back upwardsby his outpatient endocrinologist , dr. wakeham3 ) psychiatric: the patient had a history of depression andduring this admission he was maintained on his outpatientmedications of prozac and restoril. his prozac dose was titratedupwards to 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. without any notable side effects. hewas discharged on this dose , 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. no furtherpsychiatric evaluation or interventions were required during hisinpatient stay. his mood remained stable during this admission.4 ) renal: the patient's creatinine was monitored throughout hishospital course remaining relatively stable despite diuresis. nofurther renal evaluation or intervention was required during thishospital stay.discharge medications: the patient was discharged on 11/10/02 on efollowing medications: spironolactone 25mg p.o.q.d.; captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.; torsemide 50 mg p.o.b.i.d.; simvastatin 80 mg p.o. q.h.s.; lantus insulin 60 unitssubcu q. a.m.; humalog insulin 10 units subcu q. a.m. and q. p.m.;k-dur 40 meq p.o.q.d.; synthroid 150 mcg p.o.q.d.; prozac 60 mgp.o. q. a.m.; restoril 30 mg p.o.q.d.admission diagnoses: congestive heart failure , ischemiccardiomyopathy , diabetes mellitus ,hypothyroidism , depression.discharge diagnoses: congestive heart failure , ischemiccardiomyopathy , volume overload ,hypothyroidism , diabetes mellitus , depression.condition upon discharge: the patient was discharged in stablecondition afebrile on 11/10/02 withoutshortness of breath , without chest pain , without any complaints.disposition: he was discharged home with vna arranged to visit himon 8/13/02 for the first time to monitor his weight ,to monitor his electrolytes and to monitor his blood sugars and toadjust his insulin and diuretic dose as needed.followup: he was instructed to follow up with dr. edwardson in1-3 weeks and to follow up with his outpatientendocrinologist , dr. adelmund , in 1-2 weeks. physical therapy was alsoarranged for home physical therapy to begin after discharge.dictated by: xavier tobias schoeninger , m.d. bj53attending: marquis j. bennet , m.d. ad2pa338/996227batch: 12672 index no. akfm0o92di
