this was 2 weeks after the placement of his biv icd.  he converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.  due to elevated filling pressures (pcwp 23), he required iv lasix for diuresis.  he was felt to be a poor candidate for cabg given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.  he was also admitted to gnc from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (pcwp 37); he received a pa line and required a lasix drip and iv nitroprusside.  at the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.he came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.  he reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  he feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.  he denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.  he states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.  of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from toprol xl to coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.  he continues to urinate to his home lasix dosing.  he denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.  he says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  he believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.  he denies recent fevers or chills.  he has no complaint of leg swelling.past medical/surgical historycadstemi 2077 s/p 2 stents to the lad (done at gnc) reports 2 other mi&#8217;s (2079 and 2080, treated at och) reportedly s/p ~8 stents in total after various interventions per report, multi-vessel disease &#8220;difficult for cabg&#8221;
