weight gain at home and altered mental status resulting ina fall at home. in the ed he had a possible seizure withdilantin loading. he became hypotensive after that and went tomicu. he was then sent to the medicine service for several daysworking up neurologic issues and falls. then the patient beganhaving chest pain, echo showed new acute decrease in the ef from45->20% and some apical and septal akinesis. cath showed severenative disease with 2 bms placed in rca. rhc showed elevatedwedge at 30mmhg. ra pressures 25 and pap 73. ci 1.5. thentransferred to [hospital1 1516] for further management..patient was given 80mg iv lasix given last night and thismorning still volume overloaded and given another 100mg iv lasixand metolazone and lasix gtt. team is concerned for poor forwardflow given lfts have increased to >1000, creatinine to 3.3, inr>2, and only 600ml uop with 20mg/hr lasix gtt yesterday..at this point, he was transferred to the hf service and admittedto the ccu for inotropes, swan, and lasix drip. ifnon-responsive to this will need iabp..on arrival to the floor, patient appears somewhat lethargic anduncomfortable but is conversant.  he endorses discomfort aroundhis foley site but denies cough, chest pain, sob, abdominalsymptoms, fevers/chills.past medical history:1. cardiac risk factors: +diabetes, +dyslipidemia, +hypertension2. cardiac

course:hospital course: 68 year old man with a history of coronarydisease status post cabg in [2107] and multiple pcis, dm type ii,hypertension and depression who presented initially on [2120-7-7]with weight gain at home and altered mental status.  he had whatappeared to be a possible seizure in the ed, resulting indilantin loading and subsequent hypotension requiring transferto the micu. he was then sent to the medicine service forseveral days while work up continued on his neurologic issuesand falls (work up negative). then on [2120-7-11], he began havingchest pain, and echo showed new acute decrease in the ef from45->20% with some apical and septal akinesis. cath the followingday showed severe native disease with 2 bms placed in rca, andrhc showed elevated wedge at 30mmhg. he was intitiallytransferred back to the cardiology service for management,however he became increasingly volume overloaded with end organdysfunction (renal and liver failure) suggestive of cardiogenicshock, necessitating transfer to the ccu under the heart failureservice..ccu course:  on arrival patient was started on inotropes,pulmonary artery catheter was placed, and intra-aortic balloonpump was initiated for support for his cardiogenic shock.  givenhis renal failure, cvvh was initiated (mostly forultrafiltration).  despite full support with intermittentpressors, iabp, and cvvh, he failed to improve.  on [2120-7-17], heself-discontinued his balloon pump, leading to rapiddecompensation necessitating urgent intubation and transfer tothe cath lab for iabp re-placement.  he was able to wean off theballoon pump on [2120-7-19], however his hemodynamics then worsenedagain, necessitating the use of pressors.  despite full pressorsupport, his status continued to worsen.  upon frank discussionwith his family regarding his grim prognosis, they felt that hewould never want to continue with aggressive care if there waslittle chance of full recovery.  on [2120-7-21], they decided totransition his care to comfort measures only.  he diedpeacefully on [2120-7-22]..please see below for details on each of his major active issues:.active issues:# [date range 7792]/cardiogenic shock: on [2120-7-11] while on medicineservice, experienced chest pain with troponin of 0.1, negativemb, but echo with new anterior wma and ef depressed at 25% (downfrom 40-45%).  cath on [7-12] showed 80% ostial stenosis of therca, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.  following thecath, he continued to decompensate.  he appeared to be indecompensated chf by renal status, crackles on exam, and mildperipheral edema.  a tte showed an ef of 20% from baseline of40-45% in 6/[2118].  he had 2 bms placed to his rca, his lvedp waselevatd at 30, pulmonary pressures were also elevated so thepatient was transferred to the [hospital1 1516] service. despite aggresivediuresis, patient continued to [last name (un) 22977] clinically, with highfilling pressures, low ci, low uop and was transfered to ccu.patient was started on dobutamine for inotropic effect (couldnot do milranone because of [last name (un) ]). he was also on lasix drip.patient had an intra-aortic baloon pump to improve systemicperfusion and coronary artery perfusion..while in ccu a swan-ganz catheter was placed to monitor co.dobutamine drip was started in setting of low co. the patientwas also started on cvvh to remove fluid thought to becontributing to decreased co as renal failure persisted. on [7-17]pt was increasingly delusional and removed his iabp partially.decision was made to remove pump at this time and heparin ggtd/c and pressure held at site. the patient's o2 sats decreasedat this time and lactate increased to over 6. decision was madeto intubate and transfer to cath lab for replacement of pump.ballon pump was weaned off of iabp on [7-19]. howver he conintuedto have high pressor requirements..#.acute on chronic [last name (un) ]: baseline creatinine 1.1-1.5, onadmission 2.2.  however after the drop in his blood pressure andafter his cath his cr continued to rise and he stopped makingurine.  renal was consulted who started ccvh to remove fluid tohelp relieve strain on his heart.  ccvh was stopped when patientwas made cmo by family on [7-21]..#transaminitis - on transfer to [hospital1 1516] service, patients lfts hadnoted to increase to alt 117, ast 418.  the day following cath,his lfts sharply rose to alt 1200 and ast 1059, ldh 1900, tbili1.9.  concern was for shock liver vs med effect, hepatology wasconsulted who felt this was due to shock liver - they rec'd tohold atorvastatin, obtain ruq u/s which showed possibly fattyliver with patent vasculature.  the following day, he developedencephalopathy and lactulose was started. lfts trended downthroughout his hospital course..#.fall at home- his initial insult was a well-describedmechanical fall from slipping on mineral oil, and he did notendorse symptoms consistent with vasovagal syncope. we alsoconsidered orthostasis given history of same vs. arrhythmia vs.seizure given possible seizure in ct scan. patient was not foundto be orthostatic. neurology consulted and had a low suspicionof seizure. mri with and without contrast was unremarkable.neurology continued to follow and did not recommend aed's..iddm: patient was kep on insulin sliding scale and hi bloodsurgars well well
