onra.  upon arrival to the ed vs= 86% on ra, hr 100, bp 155/59, rr32.she was treated for copd flare (steroids), chf (bipap, lasix,nitro gtt), and pna (levaquin).  cta not performed [2-21] inabilityto lie flat, but pt empirically started on heparin gtt.  heroxygen status improved and she was transferred to the micu.in the micu, pt's antibiotic coverage was broadened to ctx/vancoand azithromycin.  in the setting of her first azithromycin doseon [6-6], pt became hypotensive requiring pressors (levo, neo,vaso), felt to be an allergic reaction to the azithromycin.pressors were titrated off ~12 hrs later on [6-7].  herrespiratory status continued to improve, and she was weaned ofbipap on [6-7], and steroids were discontinued as copd was feltless likely.on [6-7] pt's hct 31->24, she was transfused 1u prbc, complicatedby grand mal seizure, and hypotension, again requiring pressors(levo, neo, vaso) for ~12hrs.  neuro was consulted as there wasalso a question of left dilated pupil, head ct showed no acutebleeding, +subacute/chronic infarctions, eeg c/w toxic/metabolicinsult, heparin gtt was held.  cta was obtained which showedvery small left apical pe, felt unlikely to account forhypotension.  tte revealed ef=20% (old), 2+mr, 3+tr.on [6-9], repeat blood transfusion performed withoutcomplication.  hct 21->26, however hemolysis labs revealedhapto<20, ldh 760->468, smear +schistocytes, suggestive ofhemolysis, dat negative x 2 ([6-8], [6-9]).  per report, pt'smental status (which waxes and wanes), is not far from herbaseline.  she responds to voice, but is a&ox1 (name) only.on [6-10] o2 and bp were stable and pt was transferred to thefloor.  on the floor she completed her course of vanc/cefepime.her bp stabilized and she was restarted on home antihypertensiveregimen.  fingersticks remained elevated, and her glargine wasincreased for better glycemic control.  she continued onalbuterol and atrovent prn for shortness of breath/wheezing.heme/onc was consulted regarding hemolysis and anticoagulation.their recommendations stated that the exact cause of hemolysisis difficult to interpret, however by the time the pt was on thefloor, the hct was rising and ldh was falling suggesting thathemolysis was resolving.  they recommended that there was nocontraindication to anticoagulation.  given her multipleindications for anticoagulation, decision was made to begincoumadin with a lovenox bridge. her inr was 1.9 on discharge,and she will continue on lovenox sq until inr therapeutic at 2-3and coumadin 10 mg daily.  the
