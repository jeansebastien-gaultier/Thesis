procedures: chest x-ray performed on 1/1/2006by freeman ziesman showing mild pulmonary edema. echocardiogramperformed on 1/1/2006 by gavin heltsley showing no significantchange from previous done 8/10/2003. ejection fraction of 25% ,left atrium 5 cm mildly enlarged , global hypokinesia , no obviousthrombi , pa sbp 57 mmhg. eeg performed on 5/25/2006 by pat byford was consistent with mild encephalopathy of toxic ,metabolic , traumatic , or other origins. no definitive , focal , orepileptiform features. previous eeg done on 9/17/2006 revealedsimilar findings. head ct on 5/25/2006 by lanny chiarito showedprominent ventricles and sulci that appear appropriate for thepatient's age. no acute intracranial process.hospital course by problem:1. cardiovascular: the patient was admitted with an elevatedbnp and chest x-ray consistent with chf flare , likely secondaryto uti. on arrival to the floor , the patient was hemodynamicallystable and asymptomatic. ekg and one set of cardiac enzymes werenegative for cardiac ischemia and his home cardiac medicationswere restarted. on examination , the patient had elevated jvp andedema , suggesting that he was volume overloaded. the patientresponded to diuresis with torsemide 5 mg iv and metolazone 2.5mg by mouth. he was switched to his home dose of torsemide 30 mgp.o. and was euvolemic on discharge. echocardiogram wasperformed on 5/25/2006 to rule out structure etiologies for chfflare. results showed no significant change from previous echodone on 6/27/2006. the patient was on telemetry during thehospital course and was noted to have atrial fibrillation withpremature ventricular contractions. he remained asymptomatic andhemodynamically stable throughout the hospital course.2. id: uti contributing to his chf flare and ms changes.urinalysis was positive and the outside hospital reportedgram-negative rods. the patient was continued on a 10-day courseof p.o. levaquin. tp-igg was negative.3. pulmonary: chest x-ray on admission was consistent with mildinterstitial pulmonary edema. the patient remained asymptomaticwith no oxygen requirement. the patient responded well todiuretic therapy for chf flare.4. neurology: the patient's altered mental status was thoughtto be secondary to urinary tract infection without metaboliccauses. b12 , folate , tsh , and t4 were within normal limits.tp-igg was negative. iron was slow with small hypochromia onsmear , suggesting mild iron deficiency. eeg was also performedon 5/25/2006 as this patient displayed fluctuations in cognitivefunction that could be related to seizure activity. eeg wasnondiagnostic for epileptiform features. the patient was startedon keppra 500 mg twice a day. his mental status appeared to be at baseline attime of discharge5. renal: creatinine 1.4 , baseline creatinine was monitoredduring diuresis. creatinine trended down to 1.3 on discharge.gross hematuria was present upon arrival to floor secondary topatient pulling on catheter in his altered mental state. bladderscan ruled out obstruction and the bladder was irrigated toremove clots. as the patient's mental status improved , he nolonger pulled on the catheter and the hematuria resolved. hecontinued to have some bleeding around the catheter secondary tobph and the trauma from manipulation of the catheter.6. wounds: the patient had a nonhealing ulcer on the leftachilles , recently seen at usccaialt hospital by dr.kampmann , plastic surgery. he saw the patient and recommendedpanafil spray for the wound and frequent dressing changes. thepatient will follow up with dr. ousley as an outpatient.7. gi: distended abdomen with question of ascites. lftsreturned within normal limits , no indication for ultrasound.8. hematology: hematuria as described above which resolved withimproved mental status. the patient's hematocrit remained stablethroughout the hospital course. the patient has a history ofelevated inr , resistant to p.o. and subcutaneous vitamin k.records from eym medical center suggest that the patient has factorvii deficiency. the patient had no episodes of uncontrollablebleeding or symptoms suggesting anticoagulative state.9. endocrine: continued the patient's home dose of synthroid.diabetes type 2 covered lantus 10 units and insulin aspartsliding scale.10: fen: potassium/magnesium scales. cardiac ,low salt diet.11. prophylaxis: proton pump inhibitor , lovenox.12. code: the patient is dnr/dni. there were no complications.discharge medications:tylenol 650 mg every 4 hours by mouth , aspirin 81 mg once dailyby mouth , dulcolax 5 mg daily by mouth for
