h/of cva, and glaucoma who presents after increasing number of falls at home.  pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza.  the pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick.  his daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period.  he has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual.  he has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months.  on average, he would fall about once a week.  on the day prior to admission, the pt walked to procter gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice.  he was helped back up by by-standers.  he describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.  during each fall he denies loc, denies cp, denies, sob, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma.  on the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise

sensitive for acute ischemia.2.  no intracranial hemorrhage.	          	          	          assessment: 76yo m w/ history of dm, htn, and h/o of cva presents with ams and increasing falls in setting of influenza.  plan:   1.	delirium:  pt's waxing and waning mental status likely secondary from his underlying infectious processes - influenza and uti.  a.	correct hyponatremiab.	monitor mental status as infection is treated2.	falls:  pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology.  pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on mmse), possible diabetic neuropathy, and a.	check orthostatic vital signsb.	check rpr/b12c.	pt needs pt evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate3.	hypovolemic hyponatremia: pt clinically appears hypovolemic.  a fena of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.a.	will check na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue ivfs4.	uti: pt has positive u/a and uc for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).  staph is an unusual cause of a uti.  a further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.  empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant cns.a.	f/u ucb.	empiric treatment with vancomycin 1g q12h for 7 days (crcl > 60), await c&s for possible alternative agents5.	influenza aa.	continuous oxygen monitoringb.	supportive care6.	code status: discussed with patient, who expressed to me he would like to be
