2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain.hpi: pt initially presented to her pcp on day of admission with a complaint of 2 weeks of intermittent chest pain. pt reported that pain has been lasting anywhere from 20 min to 1 hour and that it emanates from the l sternal border with radiation to l lateral thorax and radiation to l arm, accompanied by tingling/numbness in l digits + occasionally right digits, as well as down the l leg. in pvh ed, pt describes the pain as    like a bleeding scar    and states    my heart is bloated    through her daughter who acted as her interpreter.  she reports that the pain, at it's worst is 5/10, but has improved to 2/10 after ntg en route to the ed and once in the ed.  she affirms nausea and diaphoresis accompany pain. pain has no relationship to position or activity -- has occurred during sitting, ambulation, and reclining. pt lives on the second story of her building and has noted that walking up stairs has been been more difficult over the past two weeks secondary to calf and ankle pain, l > r, follow by chest pain.  pt has not had to use more pillows in the past two weeks when sleeping, and reports no change in the number of times per week that she wakes up short of breath, which varies between one to two times per week.  pt denies increased swelling in extremities over the past two weeks or increase in weight.allergies       celebrex    - sob : "that triggered her asthma"medications      aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)    81 mg,  1 tablet(s)  po qd      calcium gluconate

cyst within the spleen. uterine fibroids.  degenerative disc disease.cxr of 12-dec-2091: the lungs are clear.  there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  the heart size is normal.  the bones are unremarkable.ekg:   12-dec-2091: sinus brady with a rate of approximately 50.  normal axis.  normal intervals.  no st elevations or depressions.  q waves in leads ii, iii and avf c/w prior inferior infarct.  q waves in v5, v6.  good r wave progression.  no atrial or ventricular enlargement noted.  no change from prior ecg's. adenosine mibi 6/20/2089:  the ecg response to pharmacological stress was  negative for ischemia. the myocardial perfusion scans show a small size, mild intensity, primarily fixed inferolateral defect consistent with prior infarct with substantial residual viable myocardium but only minimal stress induced ischemia. compared to the study of 01/26 with treadmill exercise (rpp ~24k) the previously noted anterior wall defect is less apparent in the present exam.cardiac cath of 12/09/2082:successful ptca of the mid rca with a 3.0 mm balloon with 20 to 30 per cent residual plaque and a hazzines consistent with possible small dissection.pt referred by dr. yarbrough, underwent catheterization forunstable angina, a positive exercise text and recent myocardial infarction.procedurepercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed on the mid rca using a maximum balloon size of 3.0 mm advanced through a 9ys7ez guiding catheter.assessment:  pt is a 59 year old female with h/o sle, interstitial nephritis, gerd, h/o positive stress s/p rca angioplasty 2082, and chronic abdominal pain who presents with c/o two weeks of intermittent chest pain reproducible upon palpation who is admitted to rule out mi with one set of negative cardiac enzymes and no ekg changes.plan:1.	chest pain: likely musculoskeletal in nature given reproducibility of pain on palpation.  however, given pt's cardiac history, will obtain two more sets of cardiac markers.  adenosine stress test scheduled for a.m. with echocardiogram pending, as well.  pt's atenenlol switched to lopressor during admission.  pt dilatrate-sr changed to isordil.    continuing home meds of nifedipine and asa.  pt to be npo after midnight for am cardiac testing.2.	sle: continuing home dose of prednisone, as well as vitamins c and d.  will notify dr. xie that pt is in-house per request of pcp, to determine if any further rheum w/u is necessary.3.	gi: will repeat amylase and lipase.  prednisone is a known cause of pancreatitis and pt's continued abdominal complaints may be pancreatic in origin. although unlikely as elevation is minimal.olivia h. grantpager 00933
