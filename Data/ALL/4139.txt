apnea throughout the night .she was placed on pressure support , which improved her saturations and decreased her hypercarbia .patient improved that her mental status with improvement of her

status issues :most likely her waxing and waning mental status and hypercarbia/hypoxia compounded by infection of pneumonia and uti .with improvements of her ventilation and oxygenation and treatment with levofloxacin of her uti and pneumonia , her mental status greatly improved on hospital day two without further waxing and waning .her daughters came by and visited her , and reported that she was at her baseline mental status on the day prior to discharge .b12 , folate , rpr were all sent that were unremarkable as causes for delta ms .we are awaiting results of the lumbar puncture from the

and trended back down to normal on the day of discharge at 3.9 .5. elevated transaminases :patient had no right upper quadrant pain .stewart sign was negative .a right upper quadrant ultrasound was

congestive heart failure history :patient was stable without evidence of chf on chest x-ray .followed her sats likely due to obstructive-sleep apnea and hypoventilation .patient was restarted on her
