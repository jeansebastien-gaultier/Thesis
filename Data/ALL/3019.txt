diagnosis: coronary artery disease with unstable angina.associated diagnoses: 1 ) history of coronary artery bypasssurgery in 1988.2 ) ischemic heart disease since 1983.3 ) inferior wall myocardial infarction in1988.history of present illness: the patient is a 57 year old man witha history of ischemic heart diseasesince 1983. he had a non-q wave myocardial infarction at this timeand in 1988 , he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction and asubsequent coronary artery bypass graft times three. in 1991 , hesustained an inferoposterior myocardial infarction and persantinethallium study demonstrated a fixed inferolateral defect. he waswell maintained on beta blockers and aspirin until july 1992.at this time , he developed symptoms consistent with unstableangina. he was ruled out for myocardial infarction at this time.an echo was significant for hypokinesis of the inferior andposterior walls and ejection fraction was noted to be 50%.persantine thallium in july 1995 demonstrated posterobasilardefect with 60% redistribution. after this episode , he had againbeen symptom free. on 1/8/95 , the patient began experiencingsubsternal chest pressure , 10/10 , with radiation to the left armwith good response to sublingual nitroglycerin with total episodetime of five minutes. on 4/5/95 , he had a similar episode forapproximately two minutes which he rated as a 7/10. on the day ofadmission , the patient had a fifty minute 10/10 episode ofsubsternal chest pressure associated with diaphoresis and dyspnea.ekg was significant only for non-specific low t waves. patient washeparinized , provided with beta blockers , and given aspirin andnitrates. the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction and theplan was to do a persantine thallium. the patient continued tohave pain of the chest at rest and was transferred to the caus memorial hospital for further evaluation and cardiaccatheterization.past medical history: as above as well as significant for poliowith subsequent muscle weakness of the lefthip and leg.current medications: on admission were notable for lopressor 50 mgq.6h. , aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,nitroglycerin intravenous infusion 20 micrograms per minute , andheparin 1300 units per hour.allergies: the patient had no known drug allergies.physical examination: vital signs on admission were notable for ablood pressure of 112-116/64-84 with a heartrate of 53-75 , extraocular movements were intact , there was nojugular venous distention , carotids were 2+ bilaterally , lungs wereclear to auscultation , and cardiac examination showed the point ofmaximal intensity was non-displaced , regular rate and rhythm ,normal s1 and s2 , no murmurs , no gallops , and no rubs. abdomen wassoft , non-tender , and non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly ,extremities showed no cyanosis and no edema , femoral pulses were 2+bilaterally without bruit , and pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.laboratory examination: on admission was notable for a hematocritof 40.3 , a white count of 10.8 , potassiumof 3.7 , pt and ptt of 12.7 and 55 with an inr of 1.1 , andcholesterol was noted to be 287.hospital course: while here , mr. mollema had one episode of 10/10substernal chest pressure not associated withdiaphoresis , nausea , or vomiting and relieved with sublingualnitroglycerin. ekg with pain as compared to old ekg demonstratedinversion of t waves in v1 through v3 and questionable inversionsin iii and f. these inversions were present on a 2/29/95 ekg butnot on a 6/21/95 ekg. the ekg changes with the past medicalhistory was most likely significant of ongoing instability of thepatient's anginal symptoms and ischemic heart disease. at thistime , the plan was for cardiac catheterization. this is a 57 yearold male with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions in thepast status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1988admitted with unstable angina and recurrent chest pain at rest.aspirin , heparin , nitrates , and beta blockers were continued.cardiac catheterization results were notable for three vesseldisease but the bypass grafts , the lima to the left anteriordescending , was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the proximaldescending artery was patent , the saphenous vein graft to the ramuswas occluded , and the left circumflex to the saphenous vein graftto the ramus may be the culprit lesion contributing to thepatient's pain and ekg changes. the patient was continued onheparin overnight post-catheterization and it was deemedappropriate to ptca the ramus lesion. the patient was taken to thecatheterization laboratory on 0/3/95 for successful ptca of theramus occlusion. post-procedure , the patient was stable and chestpain free. post-catheterization , the patient was afebrile with ablood pressure of 106/68 and a pulse of 64. the right femoralcatheter site was without hematoma , no bruits , and femoral pulseswere 2+. dorsalis pedis pulses were intact bilaterally and therewas no cyanosis. the patient was enrolled on the amh protocol asper dr. androsky and as such , received 36 hours of intravenousprotocol therapy post-catheterization. the right groin sheathswere removed without difficulty , hematocrit at this time was 35.7 ,and the patient remained in stable condition with complaint ofchest pain. the patient was discharged home on the fourth hospitalday. physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of130/80 , a pulse of 65 , respiratory rate of 20 , temperature of 99.4 ,o2 saturations of 93 and 94% , and examination was within normallimits. cardiac examination showed the point of maximal intensitynon-displaced , regular rate and rhythm , and no murmurs , gallops , orrubs.disposition: the patient is stable upon discharge and symptomfree.discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. andlopressor 50 mg p.o. four times a day.follow-up: the patient is to follow-up with dr.
