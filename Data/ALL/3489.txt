southobassking&apos;s villemarg hospital .principal diagnosis :acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .associated diagnoses :ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .principal procedure :7/21/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .other procedures :06/29/93 - white cell scan ; 07/03/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .history of present illness :this extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .she was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .there were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .she was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to o center in sondibrid ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on ciprofloxacin .blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative staph , and alpha hemolytic streptococcus .her antibiotics were appropriately changed .at the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for further evaluation .hospital course :further evaluation at heaonboburg linpack grant medical center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .there was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .she was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .the patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .she was evaluated by the gynecology service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the gi service where she underwent a barium enema .there was no evidence of gi or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .in addition , she was evaluated by the sileyer medical center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .she had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .towards the end of june , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .a rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .on 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .she was moved to the intensive care unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .after considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .also , no source for sepsis had been found .because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .during her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .she , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .it was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .her valve was replaced with a st. jude medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .she weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .she was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .in the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .the sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .she was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .with clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .she subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .she remained on full support in the intensive care unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .after consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m.autopsy permission was granted .riemund c. graft , m.d.tr :qt / bmotdd :07-26-93td :07/27/93cc :collea douetscarv , m.d.gittetumn darnnaman graft , m.d.asha vengloan , m.d.bulon vitro , m.d.hypor
