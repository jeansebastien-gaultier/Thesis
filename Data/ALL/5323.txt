for a cervical laminectomy with fusion on jan. 21, 2095 by dr. noah blanchard       chief complaint & history of present illness: this 73 year old gentleman has been  disabled assistance and wheelchair bound since 2066 when he suffered a compression fracture in a fall from a ladder at an amusement park.  he has been disabled but  has managed to stand  and get himself in and out of the wheelchair.  he began noticing cramps and tingling of both his upper extremities and they felt the same as before he had his cervical laminectomy in 2081. he was unable to grip his cup and began dropping objects. nerve conduction studies were done in september 2094 the conclusion is that he has bilateral evidence of cervical polyradiculopathy right greater than the left.  evidence of sensory poly neuropathy there is also evidence to suggest a mild mean neuropathy at the wrists bilaterally        past medical history:  1.  paraplegia secondary to compression fracture in amusement park

mi by enzymes. ruled out for aortic dissection by ct. last adeno-mibi 3/2092 - posterior wall mi, negative for ischemia. purpose(s): diagnosis of ischemia. diagnoses: primary diagnosis is chestpain. additional diagnoses include hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia. medications: albuterol, ecasa, furosemide, lopressor, losartan. procedure: the patient underwent an adenosine stress test with exercise. maximum adenosine dose: 140 ucg/kg/min. supplemental arm exercise x 0:00 (min:sec). 1 lb hand held weight 1097mbq 99mtc sestamibi were injected intravenously following infusion of adenosine with exercise and tomographic imaging data acquired. additional data were acquired following intravenous injection of another 406mbq 99mtc sestamibi at rest on the same day. global lvef was computed and qualitative assessment of regional systolic function was made. stress test results: duration @ max dose (min:sec) 5:00 hr (rest=>max) 56 => 74 (50% predicted) bp (initial=>peak) 150/60 => 150/60 (minimum = 130/x) peak double product: 11100 endpoint(s): the protocol was completed. chest pain did not occur. rest ecg: the rest electrocardiogram revealed nonspecific st segment and t-wave abnormalities. sinus bradycardia 56/min. first degree avb stress ecg: no st segment changes were observed during this test. arrhythmias: none stress test comments negative for ischemia. however, the sensitivity of adenosine-induced st segment changes for detecting significant cad is limited. scan results: the left ventricle is normal in size. there is a moderate reduction in tracer activity in the posterobasal wall of the left ventricle which persists after reinjection at rest. the left ventricular ejection fraction was 50% on the stress study. regional wall motion abnormalities were noted in the posterior wall on the stress study. conclusions: the ecg response to pharmacological stress was negative for ischemia. the myocardial scans show posterobasal infarction without ischemia--lvef=50%. 5.  ileoloop complicated by pyelo x7 2079-2082 + neurogenic bladder6.  tia 's did have bilateral carotid endarterectomies7.

during this admission as well as a cat scan to r/o aortic dissection. ( also negative)  his biggest problem seems to be his "not very well controlled diabetes".  there is a note from the may 2094 admission that he was to receive a trial of nexium to see if his "chest pain" was epigastric" but pt and wife said he never received this medication.  he denies any gerd or "chest pain" since may 2094.  he recognizes his hypoglycemia sx's and  also his hyper glycemia sx's ( blurred vision) when his blood sugar is 480.  he will not take his glyburide the night before surgery and the morning of.. he will take 1/2 dose of insulin the morning of 15 untis nph.    he denies any medication allergies but staes that "muscle relaxants" cause his legs to become flaccid.            plan:                 proposed anesthetic: general endotracheal                 monitors:  standard, arterial line                 pain management: ivpca                 autologous blood:none                 premedication: none                 usual medications: lopressor, norvasc                 medications to be held before surgery: glyburide                 diabetic medications: 15 units of nph insulin morning of surgery                 nsaids:  avoid for three days prior to surgery                 aspirin:  avoid for one week prior to surgery                  npo:  after midnight     ancillary studies:          labs pending:          ekg: formal reading pending          cxr: pending     ____________________________________________________     willean gabriella yamamoto, msn, rn,c-np     pata medical director/staff anesthesiologist:     i have reviewed this preanesthetic assessment and concur with the assessment and recommended plan with      the following exceptions:     signed:  ______________________________________________     attending surgeon reassessment note:     i have reviewed the above history and physical exam and agree with the findings.  additional comments:     signed:_______________________________________________
