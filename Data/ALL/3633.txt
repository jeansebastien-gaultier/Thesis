hypotensionmajor surgical or invasive procedure:t tube placement and cholangiogramegd x 4history of present illness:patient is an 84 year old female with history of dementia,hypertension, type two diabetes mellitus, bipolar disease whopresents with two weeks of declining social functioning and pointake, usually able to walk with walker and perform adl. ctscan at [hospital1 2025] showed (-)ct and (-) troponins. admitted to [hospital1 18][10-12], tox screen (-), ces (-), primary team managing bp medsand psyche meds. was being worked up on [wardname 836] for renal failureand balancing htn meds, when found by nsg staff to be'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds.code blue called, initial blood pressure 80/50 with improvementin mentation to baseline. two hours after event, noted to havedecreasing bps to 60s with concurrent mental status changes.repeat bps in trendelenburg resolved to 110 with return ofmentation. she was transferred to the micu on [2186-10-15] for nsgconcern of hypotension..in the micu she had three more episodes. these werecharacterized by unresponsiveness, lack of a radial pulse (nofemoral pulse was taken), and a post-ictal confusional statemost consistent with seizures. her ekg during these episodes wasunremarkable, although she does have a baseline rbbb. hence,heart block was deemed unlikely. micu team was suspicious ofseizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal andtactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline afterepisode. further, given her diabetes and her labile bloodpressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern. she wasworked up by multiple teams, including neurology. per neurologya head ct was obtained which indicated atrophy w/ mildmicroangiopathic changes. she was put on eeg monitoring tocapture seizure activity however she did not have an episodeduring monitoring. other considerations were her baselinepsyciatric disorder or medication regimen. she was seen bypsychiatry who do not feel her episodes of hypotension areentirely explained by her bipolar disorder. finally nephrologywas consulted to evaluate a renal source of her labile bp andpossible source of hypotensive episodes. nephrology determinedshe did not have ras by us and captopril study and did not feelthat her labile bp was renal in origin. ultimately, it was feltthat a polypharmacy of her bp and anti-psychotic medicationswere responsible for these episodes. her bp/ psych med regimenwere tapered and she has been stable for 3 days. she wastransferred to [wardname ] [2186-10-17] for further workup of an anion gapand elevated wbc prior to anticipated discharge to a rehabfacility..of note, recently hospitalized @quincymc for mania, had episodeof syncope; workup head ct, head mri,

right lobe of the thyroid. small remnant ofthe left thyroid lobe is unchanged compared to the prior study..brief hospital course:patient is an 84 year old female with mild dementia,hypertension, diabetes mellitus type two, and bipolar disease,who presented on [2186-10-11] from [hospital3 ] with failure tothrive, and was being worked up for renal failure and balancinghypertension medications, who was found by nursing staff to be'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 secondsand transferred to intensive care unit..# unresponsive episodes -patient had initial episode of unresponsiveness, and additionalepisodes witnessed by the intensive care team. there was concernfor seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbaland tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline afterepisode. given her diabetes and her labile blood pressure,autonomic seizures were of particular concern, as was completeheart block (given known rbbb with lafb) however telemetrytracings remained within normal limits. it was also concerningthat her medications could be playing role. she was monitored ontelemetry which was unrevealing for a cause, a transthoracicecho did not reveal clear cause, nor did continuous eegmonitoring. several of her blood pressure medications were heldto avoid hypotensive episodes, which ultimately felt to be the alarge part of the cause.she had no further episodes after her first transfer out of theintensive care unit on [2186-10-17]..# hypertension - patient has historically difficult to controlblood pressure, with typical systolic blood pressure of 180's asan outpatient. an abdominal bruit was appreciated on exam. arenal ultarsound showed bilateral flow with doplers. imagingwith captopril was obtained to further evaluate for renal arterystenosis, and was within normal limits. a work up for othersecondary causes was initiated, including hyperaldosterone,hyper-renin, hyper-acth, and pheochromocytoma. her work uprevealed slightly elevated normetanephrine in serum and urine,as well as very mildly elevated epinephrine, norepinephrine,dopamine, and catecholamines; it was not felt that these wereconsistent with a pheochromocytoma. an am cortisol was found tobe elevated and resistant to supression by 1mg dexamethasoneovernight. because of that, a ct abdomen/pelvis was obtained on[2186-10-26] to look for source of cushings syndrome or ectopicacth secretion-- it showed inflammation around the duodenum andhead of the pancreas but no adrenal masses..her blood pressure medications were slowly re-introduced, toavoid hypotension, with goal systolic blood pressure greaterthan 130's to 140's..at time of discharge, her blood pressure medications were:- metoprolol 100 mg q8 hours- clonidine tts 2 patch weekly- captopril 75 mg q8 hours.# arrythmias: cardiology was consulted early in her stay afterepisodes of v-[last name (lf) ], [first name3 (lf) ], and pvcs. it was recommended tocontinue rate control metoprolol, as well as continue her ace-i.electrophysiology was asked to see patient again on [2186-10-22]for repeated episodes of v-[year (4 digits) ]. at that time, amiodarone wasinitiated at 200 tid,tapered to 200 mg [hospital1 ] on [11-1], and finally continued at 200 mgdaily since [2186-11-14].  she had no further arrythmias noted..# renal insufficiency - upon admission, she had worsening of herrenal function with a creatinine to 1.7. it was felt that herrenal insufficiency was pre-renal in nature, and she was givengentle intravenous fluids. it was thought she had an element ofdiabetic nephropathy as well. the renal team was consulted andassisted with management of her care. her creatinine rose to 2.0at its peak, coinciding with her hypotensive episodes. at timeof discharge,  her renal function was stable at 0.8-1.2, and shecontinued to put out good amounts of urine...# type two diabetes mellitus - patient was on glipizide at home,however with her worsening renal function and very little pointake, a sliding scale of insulin was started, and basalinsulin was added as needed.at time of discharge, she was on 30 units of lantus in additionto a humalong sliding scale..# hypothyroidism - patient has history of thyroid carcinoma andis status-post thyroidectomy. at time of admission, her tsh wasvery suppressed, but her free t4 level was within normal limits.her tsh rose during her stay, peaking at 32. her t4 studies werefound to be low. endocrine consultation was obtained to assistwith management of her thyroid disease, especially withconcurrent use of amiodarone and lithium. her dose oflevothyroxine was increased to 300 mcg for several days, thenbrought down to 175 mcg prior to discharge.  her tsh remainedelevated (15) on a subsequent check on [12-13].  this was associatedwith a normal free t4 (1.5).  after discussion withendocrinology, it was felt that she may not be absorbing welland may be becoming progressively more hypothyroid.  her tubefeeds should be held 30 minutes before and after administeringsynthroid; she should have her levels followed to ensure thatthis is effective.  if she is still underreplaced, she may needto have iv levothyroxine.- her thyroid function tests should be checked and followed up1-2 weeks after discharge.- an ultrasound of her thyroid was checked to assess for anythyroid disease or cancer recurrence in light of her elevatedtsh. the ultrasound was unchanged from prior studies..# upper gastrointestinal bleed: on [2186-11-4] patient developeda decline in her hematocrit to 19, with guaiac positive stools,then melena and bright red blood per rectum. she was transferredto the intensive care unit, and gastroenterology was consulted.an upper endoscopy revealed bleeding duodenal ulcers that wereinjected and cauterized. she required a total of 9 units ofpacked red blood cells during her intensive care stay.her hematocrit remained relatively stable after her transferback to the general floors on [2186-11-8], until [2186-11-15], atwhich time her hematocrit continued to drift downward and herstools were guaiac positive. plans were made for a colonoscopy,however, in light of an additional hematocrit drop to 20, arepeat endoscopy was completed on [2186-11-17], and a new thirdduodenal ulcer was noted which was also treated. she receivedtwo additional units of red blood cells..testing for h. pylori was negative, and gastrin levels wereelevated; the elevated gastrin levels were expected in settingof ppi use, and endocrine consultation did not feel there wasany additional pathology contributing to the elevated gastrinlevels.- [hospital1 ] ppi was initiated and should be continued for at least 4additional weeks, then continued daily.- patient will need follow up with gastroenterology afterdischarge, for possible further evaluation of nodules seenduring her first endoscopy..# c. difficile colitis: patient developed diarrhea on[2186-11-24], and stool samples revealed c. difficile. she wasinitiated on treatment with flagyl on [2186-11-25], however wasrefusing oral medications, so intravenous flagyl wasadministered until [2186-12-2] at which time she could receiveoral medications via her peg.she did not have any abdominal pain or distention.her white blood cell count bumped to >20 at the time of her c.difficile infection.  then improved.  around [12-5] her wbc countagain increased, with no other clear etiology found.  it wasdecided to change flagyl back to iv, and to add po vanco.  theplan is to continue iv flagyl and po vanco until about a weekafter wbc stopping other antibiotics (cipro for uti)..# bipolar disorder:patient had recent hospitalization for manic episode at outsidehospital. she has long standing history of depression and manicepisodes, with numerous prior psychiatric admissions. her familygave history that many of her prior depressive episodes hadstarted with refusal to eat..psychiatry team was consulted at the start of her stay andfollowed along the entire time. therapeutic options for herbipolar disease were limited given her multiple serious medicalco-morbidities. there was concern during her stay for seizuresand serotonin syndrome, however neither was felt to have takenplace. she was titrated upward on citalopram to 40 mg (increasedfrom 20 mg on [2186-11-24] and increased from 30mg on [2186-12-11]).given her prior success on lithium, which had been stopped dueto "toxicity" of unclear etiology, the decision was made tore-introduce lithium while in the inpatient setting where thepatient could be carefully monitored. 150 mg qhs was started on[2186-11-8], and levels were closely followed, with goal levelabout 0.5..ect: psychiatry felt that one of the best options would be ect,however the patient continued to adamantly voice her refusal.several family meetings took place with her primary carephysician, [name10 (nameis) ], primary medical, and psychiatric teams todiscuss various options for her severe depression, which wasfelt to be the main reason for her failure to thrive and poor pointake.given her refusal to ect, legal guardianship would need to bepursued if the patient's family desired to pursue ect and it wasnecessary to deem the patient incompetent to make a decisionregarding ect due to her depression.- remeron was considered, but contraindicated with use ofclonidine.- rilatin was also considered, but contraindicated with hercardiac arrhythmias.- patient will need continued follow up with psychiatry as anoutpatient..at time of discharge, the patient's mood and affect had improvedgreatly since her initial presentation, and she appeared muchless flat. she was answering questions with complete sentenceswith improved, though still limited, range of emotions..# failure to thrive/anorexia - patient continued to refuse toeat and take her medications during most of her stay. as hermedical problems cleared, she became more interactive andstarted to eat small amounts and take her medications. aftermuch discussion and a trial of one week once medically stable toimprove po intake, decision was made to place peg tube, whichwas completed on [2186-12-1].- physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted andfollowed along during the patient's stay.- thyroid management as detailed above..# dementia: patient has history of mild dementia. she wasinitially on namenda, however it was held due to herunresponsive episodes, contribution to hypertension, andpossible serotonin syndrome..# tachypnea: patient had intermittent episodes of increasedrespiratory rate, ranging 25 - 30. her oxygenation remainednormal, and her lungs were clear, and she denied any complaints.several chest x-rays were unrevealing. her tachypnea improvedoverall, but she would occasionally have episodes of increasedrespiratory rate when aroused, agitated (eg by asking severalquestions)..# acalculus cholecystitis:a ruq us showed possible gb wall necrosis and microperforation.surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous gb tube,which was placed on [2186-10-27].  it was assumed that this wasthe source of her persistent leukocytosis, since her wbc fell to15 after placement of the tube, but the wbc has since increased. on [10-28] after the procedure, levo/flagyl was switched to zosynfor better gram negative coverage.  vanco was continued.throughout all this, she has had no fevers, denies abdominalpain and has a relatively benign abd exam w/ no guarding,rebound or ruq tenderness.  surgery strongly feels that she doesnot have an "acute abdmonial process" and they want to revisitthe idea of an elective cholecystectomy in [3-18] weeks.  however,it seems most likely that the necrotic gb was the course of thepersistent leukocytosis.- her drain site remained clean, dry, and intact.- several cultures from her bile drain were without growthexcept for one that haad coagulase negative staph, felt to be acontaminant.- patient's percutaneous gall bladder drain was clamped on [12-8]and removed on [2186-12-11]..# conjunctivitis: patient completed course of treatment witherythromycin eye drops..# oral thrush: patient occasionally had evidence of whiteexudate on her tongue, which was possibly thrush given her verypoor po intake and refusal of mouth care ans swabs. it waspossible that thrush was also contributing to her lack ofappetite.- nystatin s+s was initiated.  it can be given on a prn basisfor recurrence..# elevated cardiac enzymes: patient's cardiac enzymes bumpedslightly in setting of her gastrointestinal bleed and relativehypotension. she had no chest pain or ekg changes, and it wasfelt that she had an episode of demand ischemia..# tranaminitis: patient's transaminases were elevated into the[2178], which occurred following her gastrointestinal bleed andepisode of relative hypotension when her systolic blood pressurewas into the 100s in setting of bleed. it was suspected that shesuffered from ischemic process (ces also bumped) due tohypotension. she had also  been getting tylenol during herduring intensive care stay, but not greater than 2 grams perday.- a ruq us was obtained to rule out thrombosis or other processwas completed without any apparent new pathology..# thrombocytopenia- patient developed thrombocytopenia down to127 at the lowest. this resolved during her stay, and it wasthought to be due to her poor nutritional status.- there were no clear offending medications on her medicationlist.- hit testing was negative..# leukocytosis, fevers: patient had fevers and leukocytosisintermittently during her stay. patient's fevers have resolved,but she has had continued leukocytosis.  patient had definitespike to > 20 with c. difficle infection.- patient had multiple sets of blood, urine, stool, and bilecultures drawn; her chest x-ray was unchanged..# anemia: as discussed above in regards to gib. her hematocritremained stable at 26-28 range prior to discharge. her anemiawas that of chronic disease as well as losses from gi tract..# urinary retention: patient had several voiding trials withremoval of her foley with persistent urinary retention. therewere no clear offending medications.- foley replaced.- patient may need follow up with urology to further managementof her foley and retention.  she will  be discharged with foleyin place..# tremor: patient had intermittent tremor of her left arm andbilateral feet, which was stable. it was not present except whenasked several questions and stimulated. does not cause patientany distress. tremor only present when patient stimulated oragitated, not present in sleep or when calm. no other evidenceof toxicity or increased tone..medications on admission:home medications:risperdal 2 mg
