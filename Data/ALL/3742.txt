ptx, gbs, hit induced pes,vent-associated pneumonia called out from the micu [10-1].  herrecent history is significant for 2 admissions to [hospital1 2025]([date range (1) 32318]/05) for spontaenous left pneumothoraces.  on her firstadmission, she had a left sided chest tube placed, a vats, andpleurodesis.  she tolerated this well and was discharged on podilaudid for pain control.  she re-presented for her secondadmission to [hospital1 2025] with a recurrent pneumothorax, got a 2nd leftsided chest tube, and was again discharged on po dilaudid.after being dischraged from [hospital1 2025] she presented the same day to[hospital1 18] complaining of diffuse weakness and body pain as well asepisodic numbness.  she was initially treated with pain controlwith a morphine pca per the pain service.  she continued to havediffuse weakness, increasing anxiety and psychiatry wasinitially consulted for ? conversion disorder.  on the eveningof [9-9] a code was called as she was unresponsibe with a poorrespiratory effort (hr 100, sbp 160, o2sat 70% on ra --> 94% onface mask).  an abg revealed ph 6.86, po2 168 pcos 179).  shewas intubated and transferred to the micu.1st micu course:a neurology consult felt her elevated lp protein (112), diffusemotor weakness, rapid time course, and rapid increase in herperipheral wbc ([8-8]) were all consistent with gbs.  she wasstarted on plasmapheresis and received four sessions (fifthsession was not completed because pheresis line had to be pulleddue to positive hit antibody).  she also developed ventilatorassociated pneumonia for which she was treated withvanco/levo/vanc for a 7 day course which was finished on [9-17].she also developed heparin associated thrombocytopenia whichimproved after d/cing all heparin products.  on [9-18], she hadincreasing respiratory distress and increasing o2 requirementsand a cta revealed pulmonary emboli found within all 3 segmentalbranches of the rul pulmonary artery.  due to her positive hitantibody, she was started on argatroban and coumadin.  she wasswitched to a trach mask on [9-23] and tolerated this and on [9-25]was transferred to the floor.  the morning of [9-26] she developed[10-27] stabbing, non-radiating, l sided chest pain.  cardiacenzymes were negative and a stat echo showed no wma.  a cxr wasunremarkable but a ct scan showed a large l ptx and she wastransferred back to the micu.2nd micu course:her inr was reversed and on [9-30] she had a mechanicalpleurodesis and lul wedge resection.  no blebs were seen butthere was abnormal appearing lung tissue in the apex.  she wastransferred out of the micu on [10-1].1. pneumothorax: unclear etiology of recurrent ptx.  possiblysecondary to her stature.  alpha-1-antitrypsin was negative.s/p l-sided wedge resection and pleurodesis on [9-30].  she had 2chest tubes and one was removed [10-6], but [initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) ] drain was leftin place.  the [doctor last name ] drain was removed on [10-17] after asuccessful flamping trial.  she will follow up with ct surgeryin 1 week.2. pulmonary embolism: she had a pe in all 3 branches of rulpulmonary artery on [9-18] ct scan.  developed hit withplasmapheresis for gbs.  restarted argatroban and coumadin [10-1]following ct surgery.  she was initially on coumadin 2.5 mg poqhs and stable with an inr between [2-21].  her inr started totrend down, however, and her coumadin was adjusted to 3 mg poqhs.  before discharge however, her inr started to trend upslightly past 3, so she was discharged on 2.5 mg po qhs.  herinr will be followed up by her pcp during her appointment laterthis week.  he has been called regarding this.3. guillain-[location (un) ] syndrome: she was s/p four cycles ofplasmapheresis (didn't get fifth cycle due to developing hit).her tracheostomy was dwonsized on [10-10].  trach was buttoned on[10-13] and removed on [10-14].  on discharge, her stoma was almostcompletely healed and well-granulated.  she will continue tobandage it until completely healed (7-10 days from removaldate), and will cover it with cellophane for showering.  herstrength returned over the course of her admission with dailyphysical therapy.  on discharge, she was able to walk on her ownwith a cane and to manage a couple flight of stairs.  she has afollow-up appointment scheduled with neurology, and has thephone number of interventional pulmonary should she have anyquestions regarding her stoma.4. pain: patient has pain secondary to her guillain-[location (un) ] andpneumothorax.  her pca was discontinued once the [doctor last name 406] drain wasremoved, and her pain was well controlled with a fentanyl patchand oral morphine, which will be tapered as an outpatient.  shewill also continue neurontin 600 mg tid per neurology.  she wasnot given oxycodone as she had a history of anaphylaxis topercocet.5. anxiety: she has chronic anxiety which has been heightened byrecent course of events.  she was placed on her home dose ofstanding ativan 0.5 mg po q6, and had several discussions withsocial work and psychiatry nurses in-house.6. ventilator-associated pneumonia - l retrocardiac opacity thathas since rsesolved.  sputhm from [9-11] with haemophilusb-lactamase negative.  she completed a 7 day course of levo/vancon [9-17].  she was afebrile with a normal wbc count on discharge.7. anemia - her hematocrit was stable since her 2nd transfer outof the micu and her anemia was thought to be secondary tofrequent blood draws.  no evidence of an rp bleed by ct scan, noevidence of hemolysis.  she was transfused with 2 units on [10-8]. her hematocrit had been stable for several days on discharge.8. abdominal pain - she developed intermittent abdominal painafter her second transfer out of the micu which requiredplacement of an ng tube with tube feeding.  her abdominal painspontaneously improved to the point where the tube was removedand she was tolerating a regular diet, and further improved onceshe was told to take pos slowly and to avoid milk products.  shewas discharged tolerating a regular diet with no furtherabdominal complaints.medications on admission:motrin 800 mg
