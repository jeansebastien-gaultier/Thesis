jayson m.d.principal diagnosis: aortic valve stenosis.history of present illness: a 75-year-old gentleman with ahistory of coronary artery disease who is status post cabg in1983 who has recently experienced unstable angina and wasadmitted in april of 2006 to omill mang medical center of forworkup and was found to have an aortic valve area of 0.8 andsignificant vein graft disease to om1. the patient receivedcoronary stents to om1 and the native circumflex at palclean center in april of 2006. of note , the right coronary artery wasseen to be occluded at that time as was the vein graft to thatcoronary. the vein graft to the lad had been priorly stented andwas noted to be patent. the patient began developing shortnessof breath and symptoms of aortic stenosis , which were complicatedby anemia , which was thought to have developed due to some avmalformations of the foregut. in view of the patient'sprogressive symptoms , it was decided to proceed with aortic valvereplacement , which was first scheduled for september , but thenrescheduled when the patient was noted to have coughing andhemoptysis. the patient was treated for pneumonia surgeryrescheduled and he is admitted to

with a 21-mm carpentier-edwards magna valve.the patient was taken to the intensive care unit followingsurgery on levophed and epinephrine drips. he was noted to behypotensive following surgery , which was refractory to pressorsand volume requiring pressor boluses and transient application ofchest compressions and the patient underwent placement of anintraaortic balloon pump. the balloon pump was weaned andremoved by postoperative day 2 and pressors were weaned bypostoperative day 3. the patient transferred to the step-downunit later on postoperative day #3 and continued to progressdaily. his diet was advanced to full house diet and was welltolerated. the patient was started on beta-blockade , aspirin andstatin for his coronary artery disease and a course ofantibiotics was completed for a preoperative urinary tractinfection the patient was followed perioperatively by thediabetes management service for tight glycemic control. thepatient was weaned off of supplemental oxygen with ongoingdiuresis and he remained in sinus rhythm and saturated well onroom air for the remainder of his stay. the patient'spreoperative flomax was restarted following the removal of foleycatheter. the patient initially had difficulty voiding and thenvoided without difficulty. he has been instructed to follow upwith his home neurologist within the next few weeks and earlierif he has difficulties. the remainder of his postoperative staywas uncomplicated and he is discharged to rehab in good conditionon postoperative day #6.at time of discharge , laboratory chemistries include thefollowing , sodium of 135 , potassium of 4.3 , bun of 18 andcreatinine of 0.8. white blood cell count is 5.7 , hematocrit27.5 and inr is 1.1.he is discharged to rehab on the following medications.1. flomax 0.4 mg
