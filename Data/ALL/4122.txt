associated with shortness of breath , and if exertional , it often improves with rest .there is no nausea , vomiting or diaphoresis .more recently the chest pain episodes have lasted up to 1 hour .on the day of admission in rogas medical center medical doctor 's office , the patient had 2 episodes of chest pain associated with shortness of breath without radiation or other associated symptoms .those episodes responded promptly to 1 sublingual nitroglycerin .of note , the patient had an exercise tolerance test on 9-7-89 , that was terminated at 6 minutes due to fatigue , where he reached a maximum heart rate of 131 , with a maximal blood pressure of 190/80 .there were no arrhythmias , no st changes to suggest ischemia .the review of systems is positive for claudication with 1 flight of stairs and for nocturia every 2 hours .past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus , peripheral vascular disease , nephrolithiasis , psoriasis , diabetic peripheral neuropathy with paresthesias .medications on admission were nph 50 units every morning , and excedrin 1 by mouth every 4 hours as needed for paresthesias .there are no known drug allergies .he does not smoke and drinks alcohol only occasionally .family history is positive for a brother who died at age 62 of a cerebrovascular accident , a brother 60 years old with coronary artery disease , and a brother at 55 with coronary artery disease .his father had a history of diabetes and cerebrovascular accident , and mother died of a myocardial infarction .physical examination :he was an obese , anxious , white man in no apparent distress .his blood pressure was 112/70 , heart rate 80 , respiratory rate 18 , and he was afebrile .his skin was warm and dry with alopecia on the lower extremities bilaterally below the knees .head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was normal .neck was normal , there was no lymphadenopathy , no costovertebral angle tenderness .his chest was clear with equal breath sounds throughout .there was no jugular venous distention .he had a regular rate and rhythm with a normal s1 , s2 , no murmurs , clicks , gallops or rubs .his abdomen revealed active bowel sounds , was soft and nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated , though the examination was difficulty secondary to obesity .his extremities revealed no cyanosis , clubbing or edema .pulses were ii / ii throughout , except for the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis , which were 0/ii .there was a bruit in the left femoral artery .his neurologic examination was nonfocal .laboratory examination :admission sodium was 140 , potassium 4.6 , chloride 108 , bicarbonate 26 , blood urea nitrogen 15 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 234 .his liver function tests were within normal limits .cholesterol was 237 , albumin 4.3 , calcium 9.8 .hematocrit was 39.7 , white blood cell count 9.1 , platelets 202,000 , prothrombin time 12.4 , partial thromboplastin time 26.9 .chest x-ray revealed no infiltrates with a normal cardiac sillhouette .the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 77 , axis-10 degrees , intervals .15 , .08 , .36 , there were flipped t-waves in i , l and v5 and v6 , with poor precordial r-wave progression compared with 1-90 .there was mild flattening in v5 and v6 .hospital course :problem #1 was cardiac .the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiogram .he had multiple episodes during hospitalization of chest pain radiating to the back , during which his vital signs remained stable and there were no electrocardiogram changes .his pain resolved with nitroglycerin sublingually and occasional mso4 intravenously .an exercise tolerance test was performed and the patient went 7 minutes 6 seconds and was terminated secondary to fatigue .there was no chest pain , his peak heart rate was 150 , peak blood pressure 160/80 .at the end of the test and in recovery , the patient had 1-mm of st depressions in the inferolateral leads .there were no arrhythmias .thallium demonstrated inferior , septal and apical filling defects with redistribution .given his rest pain and the results of the thallium , the patient went to catheterization , which demonstrated a left anterior descending with diffuse disease , a 60% proximal and 80% distal stenosis , obtuse marginal branch #2 with an 80% proximal stenosis , left anterior descending d1 80% , left anterior descending d2 80% .a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed on the obtuse marginal branch #2 , with stenosis going from 80% to 20% .post-percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty the patient had recurrence of his chest pain and was returned for catheterization , which demonstrated patency of the obtuse marginal branch #2 .the patient was started on diltiazem and isordil and remained pain-free on these medications .problem #2 was diabetes mellitus .the patient 's blood sugars remained well-controlled with diet and 50 units of nph every morning .problem #3 was fatigue .neurology consultation was obtained and the opinion of the neurologist was that the pain was not secondary to muscle weakness .the leg pains were
