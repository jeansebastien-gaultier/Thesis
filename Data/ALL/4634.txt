:radiation therapy to the right clavicle 07/16/2004 .history of present illness :one of several puomc admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .she had actually completed her five years of tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .she ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .she had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .there had been no focal neurologic changes .up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .on admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , o2 saturation on room air was 92% .she did look mildly dyspneic .her lungs were clear .she had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .she was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .the rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .laboratory data :sodium of 137 , bun of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .bilirubin normal .her alt 11 , her ast slightly up at 59 .her alk phos slightly up at 174 .wbc 10.8 with normal differential .hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , mcv 89 , platelets 345,0000 .a urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .a ca 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .the patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .she gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .this was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .she also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral mris to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .she had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of physical therapy .a single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .the sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .plan :escalate the doses of the dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o'clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional ssri overlap until it seems to show more affect .she lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .the patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .she was begun on letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to dr. first 's office to have further discussions of this later approach .discharge medications :zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. colace 100 mg b.i.d. senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .multivitamin , megace 200 mg
