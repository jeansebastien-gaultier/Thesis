unit no:  [numeric identifier 64973]admission date: [2118-2-25]discharge date: [2118-3-15]date of birth:  [2047-12-14]sex:  fservice:  vsuhistory of present illness:  briefly, this is a 70-year-oldfemale, with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm, transferredfrom an outside hospital with severe abdominal tenderness andhypotension. a ct scan at the outside hospital showed noextravasation; however, she was hypotensive on evaluationwith severe abdominal pain.past medical history:  significant for cryptogenic cirrhosis,mitral valve regurg, lap-chole, total abdominal hysterectomy,status post appendectomy, and status post ventral herniarepair.medications:  included propranolol, spironolactone, lasix andlevoxyl.allergies:  she has no known drug allergies.physical exam:  she was afebrile. vital signs: her heart ratewas 65, blood pressure in the 60s, and she was 100% on 2liters. she had significant abdominal tenderness withguarding.her white count was normal, inr was 1.3, and her pt was 30.her bun and creatinine were 27. and 1.5.hospital course:  patient was taken to the operating roomemergently for a question of a ruptured abdominal aorticaneurysm. intraoperatively, it was found that she had a largeaneurysm. there was also extensive bleeding from hercirrhosis and; therefore, she was left packed and open.please see the operative report for further details.postoperatively, she was transferred to the surgicalintensive care unit, and she was aggressively resuscitated.after this was done, over the next couple of days shestabilized, bladder pressures were followed, and she wastreated for ards with an esophageal balloon, and ventilatorymanagement, and an echo was done which showed normal ef.the patient was then returned to the operating room forabdominal washout. transplant surgery was consulted whoassisted in the operative intervention. at this time, it wasdecided that the patient would return to the operating room.during the second washout, a vicryl mesh was placed, and avac dressing was continued. her lfts were followed, and herplatelet count was also followed, and her platelet countbegan to slowly fall. because of this, a hit panel was sent,and this was positive. her heparin was stopped, her lineswere changed, and she was followed from this standpoint.postoperatively, from the second washout she was continued onventilatory management, and she was kept on levophed forblood pressure control. she continued to require significantfluid resuscitation, as she was losing over 3-4 liters ofascites fluid from her open abdomen. vac dressings werechanged at the bedside multiple times, and there was slowgranulation tissue. she was started on tpn for nutritionalsupport during this time.after multiple attempts at weaning the ventilator wereattempted, it was decided that the patient would proceed to atracheostomy, as she was not weaning adequately. because ofthis, a tracheostomy was performed, and she did well fromthat standpoint. she slowly began to improve. however, lftscontinued to rise, and her vac drain output continued to stayhigh at over 5 liters. she was continued to be replaced withalbumin, as well as with iv fluid. during this time, shebegan spiking fevers. pancultures were done, and she wasfound to have pseudomonas in her lungs and; therefore, shewas changed from zosyn to meropenem. she became afebrile atthat point, and she continued to do well from a pulmonarystandpoint. however, she continued to require highventilatory support with high peep and high pressure support,and she was intermittently switched back and forth betweenassist control and cpap.from a graft standpoint, she had palpable pulses and gooddistal perfusion throughout. she was attempted on multipleoccasions to be given anticoagulation using argatroban andlepirudin. however, her creatinine clearance and primaryliver function abnormalities did not allow for adequateanticoagulation. she had multiple episodes of bleeding, bothfrom her ng tube, as well as from her foley which requiredsignificant blood product resuscitation. as her bilirubin andlfts began to rise, and her vac output continued to rise, ahepatology consult was performed, and a liver ultrasound wasalso done. the liver ultrasound found that she had thrombosedher portal vein, and because of her dropping hematocrit, thehepatology service proceeded with an endoscopy. multipleesophageal varices were identified, and while no activebleeding was present, these were significant, and felt thatthey would likely cause bleeding in the future. therefore,they were banded.again, she began having high fevers, and she had ventilatoracquired pneumonia with the pseudomonas, and this had nowbecome resistant to meropenem. therefore, she was changed tociprofloxacin. at the same time, she had blood cultures whichhad gram-positive cocci. she was started empirically onvancomycin. during one of these episodes of hypotension, shehad some [known lastname ] changes which were concerning for myocardialischemia. an ekg was done, and cardiology was consulted. theyfelt that ultimately this was due to demand ischemia from heroverwhelming sepsis. they had no further suggestions otherthan supportive care as tolerable.multiple family meetings were done, as the patient continuedto not improve. the family was present throughout multiple ofthese decisions, and it was decided ultimately that she wouldbe made dnr pending any further results or deterioration.after proceeding with the ultrasound and finding thethrombosis of her portal vein, a repeat family meeting washeld, and it was decided that the patient would be madecomfort measures only. she was made comfort measures on[2118-3-15] and passed away shortly thereafter.patient's family was present throughout the entire time, andafter the meeting was there at the time when the patientpassed away. patient died at 1:15 p.m. on [2118-3-15].the patient's family declined a postmortem evaluation at thistime.discharge diagnoses:1.  liver failure,2.  thrombosed portal vein.3.  esophageal varices.4.  abdominal aortic aneurysm status post abdominal aneurysm    repair.5.  status post abdominal washouts.6.  status post vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and vac    placement.7.  status post tracheostomy for respiratory failure.8.  ventilator acquired pneumonia.the patient passed away on [2118-3-15].
