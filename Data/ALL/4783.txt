regarding her diabetes.  since i last saw her, she has been hospitalized with bilateral pyelonephritis in mid october.  since discharge, she has been feeling well, and a repeat urinalysis and urine culture on october 27, 2094, were essentially within normal limits.  she denies any recurrent flank pain, fevers, chills, or dysuria.  says overall she is feeling relatively well.  she is taking all of her medications as prescribed.  she denies any polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, or blurry vision.  she continues to smoke.  she has not been exercising.  she also continues to have intermittent chest pain of unclear etiology.  several days ago, she had an episode that lasted a minute or two at rest.  she described it as a tightness, and it was not associated with shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or neck or arm symptoms.  she has no recurrent symptoms since then, and has had no exertional symptoms in the past few days.  she has not been taking her blood sugars at home as her machine is broken.  also, she self-discontinued her lisinopril.  she thought it gave her a headache.youngman, codi 0638637111/24/94page 2physical examination:  she is an obese young woman in no distress.  pulse 68 and regular.  blood pressure 134/84 and weight 226.  fingerstick today 198.  neck veins are non-elevated.  no carotid bruits.  oropharynx is clear.  lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  cardiac exam is regular rhythm.  normal s1 and s2.  no murmurs.  extremities are warm and without edema.  feet are without ulcerations and sensation is intact to vibration and light touch.laboratory data:  her ekg today reveals a normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals, normal st segments, and normal t-waves.  hematocrit and troponin are pending.impression and plan: a 37-year-old woman with multiple medical problems as follows:1.	type 2 diabetes.  her hemoglobin a1c has continued to run in the 9.0.  she is poorly controlled and remains unwilling to try glucophage again due to the diarrhea.  at this point, it is prudent to consider switching her over to an insulin regimen starting with b.i.d. nph, and we will refer her to the diabetic teaching nurse, and see her back in about a month with a plan to transition her at that time.  her urine microalbumin was negative a few months ago.  we will recheck her hemoglobin a1c today.  she has been to the ophthalmologist recently, and does not need to see the podiatrist as of yet.2.	regarding her chest pain, her persistent intermittent chest pain is somewhat concerning.  she does have coronary disease as per her mibi just over a year ago.  she is taking an aspirin and a beta-blocker.  her ekg today is normal, and she has been symptom free for at least the past 2-3 days even with exertion.  given this, i advised her should she have recurrent pain at rest or with minimal exertion to call me and come to the emergency room, otherwise, to continue taking her aspirin and beta-blocker.  i will repeat her stress test to see if her ischemic burden has increased in which case we will consider referring her to cardiology.		youngman, codi 	06386371	11/24/94	page 3		3.	regarding her hypertension, given her diabetes, we would prefer better blood pressure control.  she agreed to try the lisinopril again at a small dose, and will let me know if she thinks it disagrees with her.  i told her i felt the headache was probably unrelated to the lisinopril.4.	regarding health maintenance, when i see her back in a month, i will do a pap smear and give her a flu shot, as she left today without receiving one.  5.	i will see her back in clinic in one month._______________________________jeffrey koehler, m.d.jk/jw4502491.docdd:  11/24/2094dt:  11/25/2094dv:
