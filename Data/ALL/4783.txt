paracentasis .history of present illness :this 61 year old woman was transferred from the iming medical center because of alleged intractible ascites .the patient had a history of post tranfusion hepatitis to twenty years duration , allegedly due to hepatitis c , and had previously failed therapy with prednisone , and also interferon .she had been known to have chronic liver disease , x 12 years .in the fall she began to have episodes of seizures associated with asystole , and for this reason had recently had a pacemaker implanted .at the time of her admission to the iming medical center in february and march of 1992 , on mar 20 , 1992 , a permanent bvi pacemaker was placed .she was also noted to have a toxic level of dilantin , originally given for her seizures , which had been tapered and switched to tegretol , alkaline phosphatase had become elevated to 600 , ultrasound of gallbladder and bile ducts were done and were normal .during her recent hospitalization at iming medical center , she was noted to have marked abdominal distension , felt to be due to ascites .a diagnostic paracentesis was said to show a sterile transudate .a weak prior to admission she developed diffuse upper abdominal pain and progressive distension with mental confusion , which partially cleared after defectation , and for this reason , the famiy requested transfer to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .past medical history :revealed brittle diabetes mellitus , intolerance for diuretic therapy , hemangioma of the liver , hypertension , meningioma .physical examination :on admission revealed a blood pressure of 150/60 .pulse 80 , respirations 20 , temperature 98.7 .she was alert and oriented .spider angiomata were present on her skin .there was no asterixis .palm erythema was present .chest was clear to percussion and auscultation .heart revealed grade ii apical systolic murmur .the abdomen revealed a four finger breadth liver in the mid clavicular line below the costal margin and in the mid sternal line there was a four finger breadth spleen .mild to moderate ascites was present .laboratory data :on admission included hematocrit 37.1 , white blood count 300 .hemoglobin 12.8 , platelets 39000 , mcv 94 , mch 32.6 , mchc 34.5 , prothrombin time was 13.6/105 , partial thromboplastic time 32.0 .differential blood count , polys 61% , lymphs 20 monos , 16 eos , 3% .sedimentation rate was 13 , reticulocyte count was 2.4 .acidic fluid tapped on 4/15 showed yellow color , moderate turbidity , white count 12,300 , 73% polys , 1% bands , 7% lymphs , 2% monocytes , 17 non hematics .admission chemistries included sodium 127 , potassium 4.0 , potassium chloride 97 , co2 22 , calcium 7.9 , alkaline phosphatase 2.0 .bun 14 , creatinine 0.8 , glucose 179 , uric acid 2.8 , albumin 2.7 , globulin 3.1 , total bilirubin 3.3 , with a direct of 1.9 , ammonia was 54 , alkaline phosphatase 287 .nuclear titres 22 , sgpt 77 , sgot 131 , ldh 234 , cpk 30 , acidic fluid total protein was .6 with a albumin of .2 , ldh 60 .serum amylase was 60 , lipase was 16 , urine culture showed no growth .stool culture was negative , blood culture was positive for streptococcus mitis on 2 bottles on apr 14 , acidic fluid cytology was negative .radiological flat and upright abdomen on 4/15/92 showed nonspecific bowel gas pattern , no evidence of free air .4/13/92 , no evidence of obstruction .portable chest 4/13/92 , no evidence of penumonia .ultrasound and guided paracentesis was done on 4/14/92 .barium enema showed a large amount of stool in the colon without sign of obstruction on 4/17/92 .gaited blood pool scan on 4/18/92 shows slight decrease left ventricular function with an lvef of 45% , minimal wall motion abnormalities confined to a small zone of the apex .persantine thallium study , no definite evidence of ischemia or infarction .abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography showed cirrhotic liver with markedly enlarged portal vein and recannulization of the umbilical vein prominent acidic fluid in the abdomen , moderate splenomegaly , right renal cyst , status post hysterectomy .electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia , first degree av block , left axis deviation .at the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with ampicillin , gentamicin and flagyl for two days and then switched to unasyn 3 grams per day .the patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy .the patient was evaluated for long term therapy .the patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with aldactone and lasix .marked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several days .because of the patient 's history of asystole , she was discussed with dr. white as a possible transplant candidate .he felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out .for that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45% ejection fraction .a persantine thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia .her diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting .the patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by dr. white , who felt , although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function .an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4/23/92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus .meanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells , with no preponderance of polys .the patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds .at the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued , and an optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to be between 126 and 128 .this period of time there was a brief increase in her sgot from the 100 's to 230 .she was discharged home on 5/5/92 on the following program .1600 calorie ada diet .no free water , no added salt , 60 gram protein diet .tegretol 200 mg. d , 6 units nph and 10 units czi qam .oscal 1
