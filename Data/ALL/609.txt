evidence of downward trending hematocrit is likelydue to worsening chronic disease. pt has been consistentlyguaiac negative, and a hemolytic work-up was negative forhemolysis. at time of discharge, pt's hematocrit is at 25. sincereturning from the icu, pt has received 2 units of blood on[7-31], with hematocrit stable at 25 since.# metastatic breast cancer -
