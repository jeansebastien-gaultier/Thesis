[known lastname ] is a 63 year-old man with a pmh notable for esrd on hd(mwf), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of cva withresidual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented tothe ed s/p seizure and hypoglycemia. course was complicated byrp bleed, s/p ir embolization of r renal artery [2112-11-17], pnas/p course of vanc/zosyn/tobra, and inability to clear his ownsecretions with subsequent recurrent mucus plugging and chronicaspiration, leading to episodes of hypoxic respiratory distress..# seizures: the patient had a witnessed event in which he hadwhole-body shaking and was non-responsive. ddx for seizureprecipitant includes metabolic etiology such as [2-24] hypoglycemiavs. infection vs. medication non-compliance. not likely acuteintracranial process as no changed on ct head w/o. no reason tobelieve that the patient has been missing his medications, perfamily and daycare. he has no complaints, and no s/s ofinfection (no fever, symptoms, and cxr w/no focal infiltrate),which could also precipitate seizures. per reviewing [name (ni) ], pt hasbeen admitted frequently for these seizures every few months.the ed [name (ni) 653] pt's outpt neurologist who recommendedincreasing keppra dose to 1500mg [hospital1 ] and continuing 500mg afterhd and checking a level.  keppra level was obtained but pendingas it is a send out. oxcarbazepine 150mg [hospital1 ] continued.treatment of hypoglycemia as below..# hypoglycemia: pt presented with significant hypoglycemia ofunknown etiology. there is no evidence of iatrogenic cause ofhypoglycemia.  workup included fasting c-peptide and insulinlevel, which were non-diagnostic given the venous glucose forthe specimen was not less than 50.  there was no evidence ofadrenal insufficiency.  his hypoglycemia resolved after rp bleedfor unclear reasons..# aspiration: pt has a documented history of chronic aspirationlikely secondary to his cva, and has been evaluated by speechand swallow multiple times in the past.  pt was found to be atincreased risk for aspiration.  however, family in the past hadinsisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk.in [month (only) ], speech and swallow commented that "as aspirationrisks are similar across consistencies, pt comfort should bedeciding factor in diet order".  pt was placed on mechanicalsoft diet/dysphagia diet on admission, as quality of life wasconsidered to be the number one priority by the family.  duringthis admission, pt was found to have significant worseningaspiration, manifested by copious secretions in airway.  he hadmultiple episodes of desatting both in the micu and on theregular floor.  he collapsed his right lung several times in thesetting of mucus plugging.  for all these episodes, he respondedwell with suction and chest pt.  after lengthy discussion withfamily, decision was made to feed the patient despite theaspiration risk. a peg tube was deferred given successful eatingwithout obvious aspiration..# fistula thrombosis/access: following his stay in the icu thepatient had a thrombosed fistula.  the level of thrombosis wastoo much for vascular or for ir to open the fistula.  he had atemporary line placed that was converted to a tunneled catheterfor dialysis and ir was able to place a picc for further accessvia venogram.  he will be discharged on a heparindrip-to-warfarin bridge for this thrombosis and acatheter-associated thrombus in the right ij..# line infection: the patient had pus noted around his right ijfollowing his time in the icu.  cultures subsequently grewresistant klebsiella and coagulase negative gram positive cocci,along with confirmation from 1 subsequent blood culture.  hewill be treated for a total of two weeks with vancomycin andcefepime, to be completed on [2112-12-20].# retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent anemia: pt was found tohave tachycardia and hypotension on hd#7, with a 9-point hctdrop.  he underwent cta, and was found to have multifocalretroperitoneal bleed in the right kidney.  he was admitted tomicu and intubated for airway protection.  pt had a total of 9units prbc.  transcatheter embolization of the right kidney wasperformed and hemodynamic stability was achieved.  subsequently,his hematocrit continued to run low, requiring intermittenttransfusions of rbcs at dialysis, with a nadir of 19.9.nephrology will be assessing whether he should be started onepogen at dialysis..# pneumonia: pt was found to have pneumonia on micu day 4, withleukocytosis andfever.  the etiology of pneumonia was hcap vs vap.  he wastreated with vanco, zosyn and tobra for a total of 9 days.  hiswbc and fever resolved s/p antibiotics treatment..chronic issues:# esrd on hd: mwf, received dialysis on schedule.  access is nowa tunneled line, given avg thrombosis and he should be continuedon sevelamer and nephrocaps..# pancytopenia: pt with macroycytic anemia and thrombocytopeniaprior. however, wbc mildly decreased at presentation to 3.0,which is a change from prior. no s/s infection, cxr withoutfocal infiltrate as above.  b12 and folate were high..# cad/cva history: ecg unchanged from prior. we initiallycontinued home aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and coumadin, butthe rp bleed complicated this regimen.  once embolization wasdone and hematocrit was deemed stable, multiple thromboses werediscovered in right ij
