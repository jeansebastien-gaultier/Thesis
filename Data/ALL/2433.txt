[2100-9-22]conclusion:1. moderate-to-severe circumferential pericardial effusion isnonhemorrhagic. this study is not tailored to rule outtamponade. however, we do not have any  indirect sign oftamponade. a cardiac son[name (ni) ] is suggested.2. ascending aorta is dilated up to 5.8 cm and its border is notwellpreliminary reportdefined. if clinical concern of acute aorticprocess remains, a c+ exam is suggested.3. bilateral moderate pleural effusion is more prominent on theleft side.portable tte (complete) done [2100-9-23]impression: low-normal left ventricular systolic function.dilated aortic root with probable small sinus of valsalvaaneurysm of the right coronary cusp and severe aorticregurgitation. at least mild mitral regurgitation - diastolicmitral regurgitation is present, in keeping with severe aorticregurgitation. there is a moderate circumferential pericardialeffusion without frank tamponade. however, the rv wall lookshypertrophied, suggesting pulmonary hypertension (signs oftamponade may be absent with elevated right sided pressures).also, the presence of severe aortic regurgitation means thatpulsus paradoxus is insensitive to assess inter-ventricularinteraction.compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [2100-9-22],the current study is more complete. the findings are probablyunchanged.chest (pa & lat) study date of [2100-9-22]findings:  there is moderate cardiomegaly, possible pericardialeffusion, and a moderate left and small right pleural effusion.a tortuous aorta is seen with aortic arch calcifications.  thereis no pneumothorax and no focal lung consolidation.vertebroplasty material is seen in the upper lumbar spine.portable tte (focused views) done [2100-9-22]impression: suboptimal image quality. there is probablymoderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a a sinus of valsalvaaneurysm of the right coronary cusp. mildly hypokineticventricular function. moderate-sized pericardial effusionwithout evidence of frank tamponade, although the right atriumdoes not fully dilate during atrial diastole, suggesting eitherlow filling pressures or early tamponade.brief hospital course:#pericardial effusion:  a cxr done on admission noted a leftpleural effusion.  a bedside thoracentesis was to be performed,however on ultrasound the heart was noted to be close to thewall. a chest ct was done [9-22] which was remarkable for a smallto moderate left effusion with a significant pericardialeffusion and ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm.  an echo wasperformed [9-22] at the bedside due to concern for tamponade whichshowed probable moderate/severe aortic regurgitation with a asinus of valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary cusp, moderatesized pericardial effusion without evidence of frank tamponade,although the right atrium does not fully dilate during atrialdiastole, suggesting either low filling pressures or earlytamponade. a formal echo was performed on [9-23] dialted aorticroot with probable small sinus of valsalva aneurysm of the rightcoronary cusp and severe aortic regurgitaton, a moderatecircumferential pericardial effusion without frank tamponade.cardiology was consulted who recommended ct with contrast due toconcern for dissection; ct showed dissection of the thoracicascending aorta with possible rupture into pericardium.  ctsurgery was consulted who recomended surgery but the patientdeclined. she was medically managed with hr and blood pressurecontrol but continued to decline over the next several days withincreasing oxygen requirements eventually requiring 100% on anon-rebreather. the patient and her family made the decision tobe made comfort measures only on [9-27]. she was given morphineand she passed away with her family at her side on the morningof [2100-9-28].# atrial fibrillation with rvr: patient has history of atrialfibrillation on coumadin diagnosed post operatively for a hipfracture in [2099-2-7].  coumadin was held in setting of gibleed.  she was given 5 mg iv metoprolol x2 and rates slowed tothe 120's.  she then had a likely vagal episode and becameacutely bradycardic with a 6 second pause.  the episode resolvedspontaneously and the patient reverted back to atrialfibrillation.  the patient was transitioned to 25 mg metoprololtid but remained in a-fib with rvr. she was placed intermitantlyon diltizem drip and converted to nsr with rates in the 60s.when the decision was made to make her cmo, these werediscontinued.#bright red blood per rectum: the patient present with brightred blood per rectum in the setting of an elevated inr of 8.0and hct of 29.0.  her hematocrit dropped to 24.2.  she received2 units prbcs and had an appropriate rise in hematocrit.  theinr was corrected with 2 units ffp and 5 mg vitamin k x 2.gastroenterology was consulted  who felt this was likely a lowergi bleed, most likely diverticular or avm, exacerbated in thesetting of elevated inr. also on the differential diagnosis arehemorrhoids and malignancy.  she did have a colonoscopy in [2098]that did not show any polyps, making malignancy unlikely.  thepatient's hematocrit stabled and she had no further episodes ofbleeding.# hypoxia: patient with intermittent desaturation.  etiologylikely multifactorial secondary to pericardial effusion and poorreserve with underlying myasthenia.  the cxr did not show anyevidence of acute infection.  she was placed on nasal cannula tomaintain oxygen saturation >92%.  please see above, but thepatient had increasing oxygen requirments eventually requiring100% on a non-rebreather. at that time the patient made thedecision to be made cmo.# myasthenia [last name (un) ]: the patient was recently diagnosed withmyasthenia after 3 years of progressive symptoms.  she had apositive anti-acetylchoine receptor antibody and was started onpyridostigmine with little improvement. she was recently starteon mestinon.  neurology was consulted regarding diagnosis andtreatment and concern for underlying malignancy withparaneoplastic syndrome.  they recommended monitoring vitalcapacity and negative inspiratory force.  neurology weighed inregarding possibe surgery and advised that the patient may havea slower recovery coming off of the vent.  the patient and herfamily made the decision to be made comfort measures only on[9-27]. she was given morphine and she passed away with her familyat her side on the morning of [2100-9-28].medications on admission:preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.information was obtained from patient.1.
