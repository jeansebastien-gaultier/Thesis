this was stopped at the timeof admission. in the setting of having her beta blocker held,the pt was noted to have several episodes of af with rvr (hr tothe 140s), as well as two episodes of svt (hr again to 140s)that was thought to likely represent avnrt. all of theseepisodes were asymptomatic for her and she remained hd stable. atsh and cxr were checked and were unremarkable. although thept's hr responded well to re-initiation of her beta blocker,this did not suppress her svt, and thus her beta blocker wastransitioned to po diltiazem. at the time of discharge, she hadnot had any svt for 24 hours. we would suggest possibleup-titration of her diltiazem as allowed by her hr and bp, andeventual conversion to the long-acting form of the medication..# diastolic dysfunction: the pt appeared euvolemic throughouther stay. a chest x-ray after several days without lasix did notdemonstrate any evidence of failure. a echo in [2145] demonstratedpreserved ef and mild ar. as above, the pt's acei, beta blockerand lasix were held at admission; these may need to berestarted in the future..# cad: the pt had a negative stress-mibi in [2145]. her asa washeld throughout her hospital stay as described above. when herhr was elevated, the pt was noted to have fairly diffuse stdepressions which resolved with better hr control, thuscontinued aspirin therapy, likely at 325 mg daily, would beideal. this was deferred at the time of discharge so that thept's hct could be followed for another 1-2 weeks..# dementia: the pt remained pleasantly and mildly dementedthroughout her hospital course. there was no evidence ofdelirium.medications on admission:aspirin 325 [hospital1 ]lasix 20 mg dailymetoprolol 25 [hospital1 ]lisinopril 2.5citalopram 20mg qhsdischarge medications:1. pantoprazole 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one(1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12 hours).2. diltiazem hcl 30 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qid (4times a day).3. citalopram 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[location (un) ] [hospital1 ] [hospital1 1501]discharge diagnosis:primary:upper gi bleedingatrial fibrillationother svt (suspected avnrt).secondary:coronary artery diseasediastolic dysfunctiondischarge condition:improved. vital signs and hct stable. pt moderatelydeconditioned.discharge instructions:-you were admitted with bleeding in your gi tract that wascaused by an ulcer. we have treated you with blood transfusions,applied clips to the blood vessels in your ulcer and are givingyou medications to help prevent a recurrence. you are beingdischarged to rehab before going home to help regain yourstrength.-it is important that you continue to take your medications asdirected. we made the following changes to your medicationsduring this admission:--> aspirin was held because of bleeding. talk with your doctorabout when or if to restart this.--> your home metoprolol was changed to diltiazem. this is asimilar medicine that we think will do a better job ofcontrolling your heart rate.--> your lasix was stopped because your blood pressure wasnormal. please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.--> your lisinopril was stopped because your blood pressure wasnormal. please talk with your doctor about when to restart this.-contact your doctor or come to the emergency room should yoursymptoms return. also seek medical attention if you develop anynew fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea,vomiting or unusual stools.followup instructions:dr.
