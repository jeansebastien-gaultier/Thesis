( held at onepoint due to the rise in the creatinine ). the patient was alsotitrated up on metoprolol to 25 mg b.i.d. rhythm: the patientwas followed by the electrophysiology service. in the ccu , hewas noted to have sinus arrest of 8-9 seconds in the setting ofapnea. following transfer to the floor , he was noted to havesinus arrest of 4 seconds , again in the setting of apnea. hislast such episode was on 3/29/05 .  in addition , the patient hashistory of atrial fibrillation/flutter , status post ablation. on0/5/05 , he underwent pacemaker placement through cephalicveins , which he tolerated well.2. pulmonary: the patient , as noted above , had several episodesof apnea , some of which were associated with sinus arrest.following diuresis , the patient's apnea episodes improved. hewas recommended for formal sleep study as an outpatient.3. renal: the patient was admitted with a creatinine roughlyaround baseline ( 2 ) , which rose briskly during hishospitalization to a peak of 3.2 on 0/5/05 .  his fena onadmission was 6-8%; a repeat fena in the setting of his peakserum creatinine of 3.2 and following 10 kg of diuresis was1.86%. his urine eosinophils were negative. his ua showedevidence of a uti plus triple phosphate crystals; urine cultureshowed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of mixed morphology. it wasthought that the rise in the patient's creatinine was likely dueto a combination of intravascular depletion and possibly uti.the patient was started on antibiotics following his pacemakerplacement , which would be expected to cover gu microbial floraand snhu microbes.4. endocrine: the patient had a history of diabetes and wasmaintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.5. id: the patient was expected to having an uti as notedabove. following his pacemaker placement , he was placed oncefazolin while in-house , followed by keflex. the patient shouldstay on keflex for four days.discharge medications:1. albuterol inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. p.r.n. wheezing.2. allopurinol 100 mg p.o. daily.3. captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.4. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.5. ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. daily.6. lasix 40 mg p.o. daily.7. heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.8. regular insulin sliding scale subcutaneous q.a.c.9. lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.10. oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.11. keflex 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. x12 doses , starting on 7/7/05 . 12. flomax 0.4 mg p.o. daily.13. nexium 20 mg p.o. daily.escription document: 4-8315924 emsfocus transcriptionistsdictated by: dubiel , scotattending: mcgarity , lincolndictation id 5034522d: 7/7/05t: 7/7/05[report_end]
