wave abnormalities consisting of inverted t waves in avl (unchanged from previous ekg 12/30/60), no evidence of ischemic changesassessment/plan:	in summary, mr. kaufman is a 53 year old man with a history of insulin-requiring dm, hypertension, chronic renal failure and hepatitis c who presents with acute onset shortness of breath and chest tightness in the setting of opioid withdrawal. his initial cardiac markers were positive, but are hard to interpret as a sign of ischemia in the setting of renal failure. he has clinical evidence of pulmonary edema and findings on cxr suggestive of interstitial edema. however, his jvp was not elevated and he only presented with mild le edema.  his symptoms of shortness of breath are consistent with left-sided heart failure, possibly caused by an ischemic event. his acute renal failure has multiple possible etiologies (some of which could occur concurrently) including chf, drug toxicity (lisinopril and nsaids), dm-associated nephropathy, chronic hypertension and renal artery stenosis.problem list and plan:sob/chest tightness:	--continue to cycle enzymes for r/o-cxr ap and lateral to assess presence of pulmonary edema	-tte	-diuresis
