on [2187-8-29]  affiliation:[hospital1 18]evaluation:an oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performedtoday in collaboration with radiology.  thin liquid,nectar-thickliquid, and pureed consistency barium were administered. herefused to try a ground consistency. the exam was performed withhim seated fully upright at 90  w/the passy-muir valve in placeover the trach.  results follow:summary:significant worsening of his oral and pharyngeal swallowingability s/p trach placement compared with his videoswallow on[2187-8-9].  he is now having penetration with straw sips of thinand nectar thick liquid and aspiration with straw sips of thinliquid.  aspiration is "silent" or without coughing.  he can notclear the aspirated material with a cued cough. he has residueinhis valleculae even when he alternates between bites of pureeandsips of nectar.  he refused to try a ground consistency.recommendations:1.  it is not possible to eliminate the aspiration risk if he    takes po's.  however, we can reduce the risk.  head position    is critical to adequate airway protection.  he must be    propped up with his head at 90 to fully protect his airway,    and the passy-muir speaking valve must be in place over the    trach.  he reported difficulty breathing by with the pmv on    by the end of our study despite 02 sats of 98%.  his    respiratory rate was 31 by the end of the exam and it    dropped back to 24 after removal of the pmv.2.  the safest way to feed him with the least aspiration risk:    a.  sit fully upright w/head propped forward at 90    b.  cup sips of nectar thick liquid    c.  alternated with bites of pureed foods    d.  only when wearing the pmv    e.  only after thorough suctioning prior to any po's3.  if he is made cmo and he wants water, we would suggest    thorough suctioning & complete oral care w/mouthwash first    then cup sips of ice water only when fullu upright w/pmv on4.  if he is unable to wear the pmv, we should repeat the    videoswallow without it to see if he is still safe to take    po's without the pmv.these recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurseandthe medical team..operative report[last

failure.procedure:1.  tracheostomy.2.  gastrostomy.description of procedure:  the patient was brought to theoperating theater and his neck, chest and abdomen wereprepared with betadine and draped sterilely. the head waspositioned extended with shoulder roll placed. thetracheostomy incision was performed first with the remainderof the field isolated with an over drape.a vertical midline incision was formed in the neck betweenthe cricoid and the sternal notch. this was infiltrated with1% lidocaine with epinephrine for improved hemostasis. thewound was taken down in the midline using cautery taking careto remain in the raphae. the anterior surface of the tracheawas crossed at the first interspace by the thyroid isthmus.the isthmus was therefore isolated and suture ligatedbilaterally with #2-0 silk. it was then divided and thesecond and third tracheal rings exposed widely by dissectionof the thyroid off of the trachea. at this time, stay sutureswere placed into the trachea in the midline at the first andthird rings with 3-0 prolene. a trap door was scored withcautery and then the trachea was entered sharply with theendotracheal balloon deflated. the transverse incision at thesecond ring was used to visualize the endotracheal tube,which was then passed distally and further work was done withairway control above the balloon until we were ready for theexchange. at this time the remainder of the flap was cutusing [hospital1 ] scissors and hemostasis was obtained using cauteryon the tracheal mucosa. at this time, a prelubricated #8shiley tracheostomy was brought onto the field. theendotracheal tube was withdrawn under direct vision to abovethe tracheotomy site and the tracheostomy placed into thetrachea uneventfully. co2 return was assured as wasventilation. the tracheostomy was sutured in place with 0silk and then secured with umbilical tapes. the inferiorportion of the tracheostomy wound was closed slightly with asingle #3-0 nylon. the superior stay suture was removed. theinferior stay in the flap was left in place and secured witha tegaderm for access should there be an inadvertant removal.procedure was terminated. estimated blood loss was less than5 cc.at this time, the neck wound was covered. the over drape wasremoved and attention was turned to the abdomen.a 6 to 8 cm incision was fashioned in the midline. the skinwas incised sharply. subcutaneous tissues were divided withthe [last name (un) 4161] and traction. the linea [female first name (un) ] was incised withcautery and the calciform ligament was visualized. this wasswept to the right and the peritoneum was entered along theleft margin of the falciform. the abdominal contents werevisualized. the colon was identified clearly and sweptinferiorly. the stomach was grasped with long babcocks inleft upper quadrant and delivered into the wound. at thistime, 2 babcocks were placed to hold the stomach up in thewound. concentric 2-0 silk pursestring sutures were placedinto the anterior wall of the stomach at the junctionapproximately of the antrum and the body. at this time [last name (un) ]cautery was used to enter the stomach through thepursestrings. this wound was dilated slightly with a clampand a #24 malecot catheter was passed into the stomach. atthis time, the pursestrings were tied and the catheter waswithdrawn through the abdominal wall approximately 6 cm tothe left of the midline and 2 fingerbreadths below the costalmargin. this was done by incising the skin generously andpassing a sarot clamp, antegrade into the abdomen andwithdrawing the end of the malecot catheter. at this time,the malecot was withdrawn to bring the stomach snuggly upagainst the anterior abdominal wall. just prior towithdrawing the catheter the final 2 cm, a 3-0 silk suturewas placed into the posterior rectus sheath and the stomachto tack the stomach up to the abdominal wall. this was tiedas the malecot was withdrawn to have the stomach flushed withthe posterior sheath. at this time, the malecot catheter wassecured in place on the skin with a #2-0 nylon.the midline at this time was irrigated with copious normalsaline and closed with a running #0 pds suture. subcutaneoustissues were once more irrigated and hemostasis was assured.the skin was closed with staples. dry sterile dressings wereapplied. the gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity drainageand will be maintained that way for 24 hours at which pointthe patient can be fed. estimated blood loss was less than 5cc. patient tolerated both procedures without

table.  right groin was prepped and draped instandard sterile fashion.  using sterile technique, localanesthesia and ultrasound guidance, the right common femoralvein was accessed and a vascular sheath for the delivery systemof ivc filter was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  thevenogram was then performed demonstrating patent inferior venacava, and the level of renal veins was identified to be at l1vertebral body.  based on radiologic findings, it was decidedthat the patient would benefit from placement of an ivc filter.the tip of the sheath was positioned in the infrarenal ivc atthe level of l1 under fluoroscopic guidance.  the filter wasthen advanced into the sheath and placed into the infrarenalportion of the ivc under fluoroscopic guidance.  the sheath wasthen removed and hemostasis was achieved after 10 minutes ofmanual compression.  the patient tolerated the procedure well.there were no immediate complications.impression:1.  no evidence of intraluminal

[known lastname ] is a 50yo man w/ rapidly progressing als who isstatus post tracheostomy, peg, ivc filter placement with coursecomplicated by peptic ulcer cauterization, and antibiotictreatment for s. aureus and b. fragilis bacteremia..#respiratory failure:the pt initially presented from home [2187-8-3] w/ chroniccomplaints of weakness, difficulty eating, and intermittentshortness of breath. at the time on the medical floor he hadworsening secretions in his oropharynx requiring nasotrachealand oropharyngeal secretions with distress resulting inhypertension and tachycardia. a scopolamine patch was placed andpt was admitted to the micu on [2187-8-8] for more intensivemonitoring and nursing care. he subsequently recovered, wasextubated, and was called out to the floor on [2187-8-10]..the patient's respiratory status remained stable until latenight on [8-21]. the pt had a sudden onset of sob withdiaphoresis, followed by hypotension. the micu team was called.the pt's vitals at midnight were t 96.1, bp 154/80, hr 100, rr26, o2 83% on 2l nc. at this point the pt was placed on nrb.during this period the pt's family was contact[name (ni) ] regarding hiscode status. he had been dni only until the day prior when thept and his family decided to allow for intubation for scheduledpeg placement [8-22]. given this reversal of code status,clarification was warranted. initially the pt's wife/hcp couldnot be reached. at 12:15 am the pt's vitals were bp 86/66, hr70, rr 16. abg was done and showed 7.04/121/138. the pt wasplaced on peripheral dopamine and given an amp of hco3. a cxrwas performed and did not show any acute pulmonary process. anekg was without acute changes. the pt's wife was reached andaffirmed that the pt was to be full code. the pt was intubatedat around 12:30 am for hypercarbic respiratory failure. hisdopamine was discontinued as his pressure stabilized. he wasfurther supported hemodynamically with ivf boluses (1.5 l) priorto arriving to the icu. in icu a r ij tlc was placed and pt wasbolused to maintain pressures..in the icu, pt was stable and multiple attempts to wean him forextubation, but he was unable to maintain ventilatory status onhis own. after much discussion with the family in conjunctionwith the palliative care team, the decision was made to placetracheostomy and gastric tube.  after trach placement, attemptswere made to place him on trach collar which he was only able totolerate for short periods. he was fitted for a passy-muir valveto allow him to speak with the trach. he has some endotrachealsecretions for which he is treated with glycopyrrolate.  he iscurrently vented with vt 600 cc respiratory rate: 14 peep: 5cm/h2o fio2: 40 % which he tolerates well..#gi bleed: he was initially guaiac negative during hishospitalization. pt's hematocrit dropped to 17 on [2187-9-9]. aabdominal ct was performed that showed no rp bleed buthigh-density material in the stomach, concerning for gastrichemorrhage.  we attempted to draw a residual through his peg,but it was obstructed, unable to infuse or withdraw. hemolysislabs were not revealing. his stools then became guaiac positiveduring this time period. gi was consulted and performed an egdwhich showed an ulceration at the peg tube site that wascauterized. surgery was consulted to reassess the peg tube, andit was cleared with sodium bicarbonate tablet solution.  he wasmaintained on [hospital1 ] ppi. anticoagulation was stopped and aretrievable ivc filter was placed on [2187-9-11]. his hct wassubsequently stable. he received a total of 5u prbc for thisbleed. throughout hospitalization peg worked without difficulty..#tachycardia: pt was tachycardic throughout stay. tsh wnl. painand anxiety were adressed with psych consult and startingmirtazapine in addition to his home sertraline. he denied anypain that might be contributing. he had an echocardiogram whichshowed hyperdynamic lv function. in discussion with cardiology,we believe that his tachycardia may result from autonomicinstability resulting from his als. during the remainder of hishospitalization, his heart rate was controlled with low-dosemetoprolol..#bacteremia: pt has been afebrile. wbc stable. follow-upcultures are negative to date.  completed 14-day course ofvancomycin for coag-negative s. aureus, levofloxacin andmetronidazole for b. fragilis..#h/o dvt: pt had wafarin and heparin doses adjusted depending onhis antibiotic regimen and or status. he was maintained on lowdose wafarin while on levofloxacin and metronidazole. allanticoagulation was stopped on [2187-9-9] with his gi bleed. aretrievable ivc filter was placed on [2187-9-11]..#elevated troponin: mr. [known lastname ] had a troponin leak at the time ofintubation peaking at 1.4. he had no ekg changes without a bumpin his ck, so he likely had a reversible ischemic event in thecontext of sepsis, tachycardia, and intubation.  he denied anycp at the time. his troponins trended down thereafter..#arf: during this hospitalization, mr. [known lastname ] had an acuteincrease in his creatinine despite good uo. renal u/s ([2187-8-27])was negative for hydronephrosis. his ua showed urineeosinophils. his creatinine increase corresponded to hisstarting zosyn, so zosyn was stopped with slow resolution of hiscreatinine to baseline..#disposition: mr.
