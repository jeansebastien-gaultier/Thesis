complicated by chronic gvhd with arthritis, boop, whopresented to the bmt floor from clinic with worsening renalfunction(2.3) and hyperkalemia, and worsening odynophagia on[2185-4-20].on arrival to the bmt floor, as he was transitioning into thebed, he became mom[name (ni) 11711] unresponsive to verbal stimuli andphysical stimuli. no jerking movements or incontience werenoted. a code blue was called. on arrival of the code team, bp124/80, hr 70s, satting 100% on 5l nc. he was responsive toverbal stimuli and answering questions appropriately. he doesnot recall only seconds of the entire episode; wife notes thathis eyes were closed. 1 amp of d50, 10units regular insulin, andabuterol nebs were given for known hyperkalemia. an ekg wasobtained which showed isolated peaked t waves. cxr showed nointerval change when accounted for technique from prior in theday. during this time, he did experience a headache that waslocated in the forhead, temples and described as a pressure /squeeze that he has experienced with prior tension headaches.he was then transferred to the [hospital unit name 153] for further cardiacmonitoring. during this time, he was also noted to have sometremors in hands and legs, but this was not associated with anyloss of consciousness or loss of consciousness. these episodeswill occur for only seconds at a time and tend to occur when heis holding objects in his hands / intention tremor. he has nothad formal workup for this, but there was no clear etiology tothis tremor (which has been present intermittently over the past2 years) to date.his wife also relays the presence of intermittent episodes ofunresponsiveness over the past x2 years ago at a frequency of1-2x per week lasting only seconds at a time. this has not beenformally evaluated to

presents to clinicwith acute on chronic renal failure. hospital course complicatedby syncopal episode the day of admission resulting in code blueand hyperkalemia, requiring brief icu admission.#syncope: patient had syncopal episode the day of admission,where he was unresponsive for ~1 minute while lying flat.unclear etiology, possible due to orthostatic hypotension (notedto have orthostatic physiology in the icu and on the floor) vsarrythmia vs seizure activity. of note, (per wife), patient hashad many of these episodes recently (~2 years, ~1-2 episodes perweek). patient denied any heralding symptoms and was notpost-ictal afterwards, but was noted to have a resting tremor inthe micu. his history of tremor is not consistent wtih seizureactivity. it appears to be an intention tremor that gets worsewhen holding on to objects and is low in amplitude while high infrequency, bilateral and not associated with change inconsciousness or incontinence.noted to be hyperkalemic during the code, given amp d50 and 10 uinsulin peri-code and kayexalate in the icu, with drop inpotassium down to 4.0 on discharge.   neurology consulted onpatient who recommended eeg and possible midodrine or fluorinefsupport. held patient's lisinopril, but continued him on hiscarvedilol 12.5 mg po bid as this was recently decreased in thesetting of light headedness/dizziness by his cardiologist on[3-21], although informed him not to take the medication if he hadany pre-syncopal symptoms. medication can be decreased at thediscretion of his cardiologist. patient had no further syncopalepisodes or events on telemetry in the icu or on the floor.neurology was consulted who recommended an eeg, possible bloodpressure support with midodrine or fluorinef, at the discretionof the patient's outpatient oncologist and nephrologist. wasnoted to not have any telemetry events or syncopal events whileambulating, with appropriate increase in pulse and bloodpressure. and requested to be discharged with outpatient syncopework-up. outpatient tte, eeg, carotid u/s, and holter moniteringwere arranged prior to discharge.#acute on chronic renal failure: noted to have mildly elevatedcre to 2.3 in clinic the day of admission. creatine hasfluctuated over the past two years, with several episodes ofacute renal failure while hospitalized. followed by nephrologyas an outpatient. per outpatient notes, etiology of ckd thoughtto be [2-14] atn that has not resolved, medication effect in thesetting of bactrim, voriconazole, lisinopril, or ain. lesslikely due to aml infiltration of kidneys (very rare) orchemotherapy. unlikely progressive glomerular disease givenpatient only has scant proteinuria. patient has refused renalbiopsy in the past. baseline cre has been 1.4-2.0 over the pastfew months.  lisinopril was held. cellcept was decreased to[telephone/fax (3) 39636] as gfr was ~30. oral fluid intake encouraged. renalfailure resolved to baseline creatinine (1.9) on discharge.renal did not have chance to formally consult on patient sincehe requested discharge, but stated informally that they had nofurther recommendations as an inpatient since he was refusingrenal biopsy, and he could be accommodated very soon in renalclinic with his current outpatient nephrologist.#congestive heart failure: euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic onexam. requested tte as outpatient. continued home meds includingaspirin, beta-blocker. held acei due to hyperkalemia.#aml: allo sct +519 days. counts stable. continued prophylacticmedications. arranged to follow up with outpatient
