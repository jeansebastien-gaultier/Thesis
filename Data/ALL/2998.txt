[known lastname 77982] had afib with rvr for which he was onan amiodarone gtt.  he was evaluated by cardiology and weanedoff amiodarone.  after amiodarone was weaned, his rhythm wasintermittently in and out of afib.  he eventually stabilized onpo lopressor and po amiodarone.  in addition, he wasintermittently on and off pressors, including levophed andpitressin.  eventually he stabilized and has been off of allpressors for over 2 weeks prior to discharge.pulmthe patient had a tracheostomy.  he was gradually weaned on theventillator.  eventually he was weaned to trach collar, which hehas been tolerating for over 2 weeks.  on [5-4], he did tolerate apassy-muir valve trial.  he requires supervision with the pmvalve, because he desaturates.  he does require suctioningintermittently.fen/gitube feeds via dobhoff, tpn, ostomy, serial abdominaldebridements [4-4], [4-8], and abdominal vac [4-12], 16, 17, 20, 24,26 and q 3 days thereafter.  last vac change was [2112-5-8].  hisabdominal wound has been healing very well with a vac dressing.it is granulating nicely.  there had been a fistulous connectionbetween the ostomy and the wound.  this has since closed offafter a few vicryl sutures were placed at the bedside.  he wasseen and evaluated by plastic surgery who recommended outpatientskin grafting.  he has been tolerating tube feeds at goal forover 2 weeks prior to discharge and his ostomy is productive.he gets his tube feeds via a dobhoff.  we did not feel that apeg was a good idea in him beacause of his anatomy.  he washypernatremic to 153 at a maximum, but he did respond to freewater boluses and his sodium has since stabilized.  we havesince decreased his free water boluses.guhe developed arf and started hemodialysis at the referringinstitution x3 days.  daily cvvh was started at [hospital1 18] via r femhd catheter, and he was weaned off cvvh, intermittently onlasix, and he now makes appropriate urine output without anyassistance.  his azotemia gradually cleared.  withing the pastweek, we have started gradual diuresis to make him about a liternegative daily.  his weights have been retruning to baseline of98 kg.hmr.
