[first name4 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) 9404] at [telephone/fax (1) 1419]..2. acute renal failure. baseline creatinine was 0.7-0.9 (0.9 on[8-15]). crea was 2.4 on [8-16].8 on [8-17].0 on [8-19]. he wasanuric from [date range (1) 67404] with uremic symptoms (nausea/vomiting).his crea was 5.7 on [8-22] after starting cvv hemodialysis on[8-20]. after having been in the icu b/o arf and recurrenthypotension, the patient recovered quickly on the floor and hiskidneys proceded to the polyuric phase. crea 1.6 on [8-28]. creacame down to 1.3 towards the end of his stay. after the polyuricphase, the kidney function returned to [location 213] output. thepatient was asymptomatic at discharge..3. thrombocytopenia. plts 152 on admission, plts 69 on [8-13]on [8-20].  anti-platelet4 (hit) antibody was positive and thepatient was initially thought to have hit. all heparin productswere d/c'ed. however, on [8-26] serotonin release ab came backnegative. since hit ab not very specific and sra test negative,the diagnosis of hit was questioned at this point. treatmentwith vancomycin correlated with the worsening thrombocytopeniaand was thought to be a likely cause. after having d/c'edvancomycin, the cbc improved consistently. the pt did not bleedsignificantly except for mild r conjunctival bleeding observed[8-22]. platelet transfusions were given on [8-24] in order to raiseplts temporarily for line removals. platelets came up from 20 to31 o/n. platelets came up considerably towards the end of hisstay (platelets 77 on [8-31]). the patient was discharged withoutany signs of active bleeding and hemodynamically stable..4. anemia: hct 35.9 on [8-7].5 on [8-24], pt received 2u prbc on[8-25] raising hct up to 26.3 and stable thereafter. followingcourse of renal dysfunction, perhaps due to low erythropoeitinlevels. iron studies consistent w/ acd. also occult bleeding wasconsidered since pt was also thrombocytopenic, cirrhotic, anduremic. stools were guaiaced. improvement was noted whenvancomycin was d/c'ed. vancomycin was likely cause ofsuppression of all three lines in the bone marrow althoughmultiple factors were certainly involved. patient's hct came upagain towards the end of his stay. hct was 29.6 [2101-9-13]. pt wasasymptomatic at discharge..5. leukopenia: wbc dropped down to 2.9 on [8-24], but after thatcontinuously rising. wbc 4.0 on [8-28] and stable thereafter(previous baseline [6-13]). possible causes were immunosuppressionb/o fungal osteo or medications, especially vancomycin whichcauses bone marrow suppression. vanco had been d/c'ed. wbcstable. patient did not develop any opportunistic infections andhis osteomyelitis stayed stable despite the transientleukopenia. pt was asymptomatic at discharge..6. pain: low back pain with radiation to both legs (r>l) wasmanaged throughout the [hospital 228] hospital stay with a variety ofpain medications including a fentanyl patch, methadone atincreasing doses, morphine, dilaudid iv and po, oxycontin andoxycodone. the patient became hypotensive on some of thesemedications. the fentanyl patch was d/c'ed b/o that althoughmultiple factors were likely responsible for his hypotensiveepisodes. methadone was tapered during his hospitalization by 20mg/day with mscontin increased by 30 mg/day throughout thetaper. his pain regimen on discharge is as follows: mscontin 430mg [hospital1 ], neurontin 900 mg tid, tylenol 500 mg qid, dilaudid 30 mgq4-6h prn, tramadol 50 mg q4-6h prn..7. thigh pain: new left lateral thigh pain on [8-25] and rightlateral thigh pain on [8-28]. no bruise or bulge at either thigh.dvt on l leg ruled out with lenis. pain seems to be muscular andmost likely due to recent use of le muscles after extendedperiods of immobility. the pain was managed with the samemedications as stated above. the new quality of pain subsidedsoon after having been mobile for longer periods and was thoughtto be different from his radiating back pain [3-10] osteomyelitis..8. acute scrotal pain: pt developed acute left scrotal painradiating up his groin and flank on [8-17]. pt received 500 cc ivns bolus, 4 mg dilaudid, scrotal and renal u/s were unremarkableexcept for an incidentally found r testicular lesion. urologywas consulted. dd included testicular torsion, orchitis, acutekidney stone, inguinal hernia. doppler u/s of kidneys negativefor [month/year (2) 5703] thrombosis on [8-17]. the pain subsided soon after havingbeen treated with dilaudid. the exact cause of this episoderemains unclear. a followup appointment has been scheduled withurology in order to work up the r testicular cystic lesion asoutpt..9. dm: pt was formerly on glyburide. last hba1c normal. pt wasrather hypoglycemic at beginning of his hospital stay and wastreated as needed. for the majority of his stay, fs were stable.pt was started on metformin 500 mg qam one week prior todischarge. pt was asymptomatic throughout his stay..10. cirrhosis/hep c: no history of gi bleeding, encephalopathyor any other complications in the past. pt developed transientlycholestatic labs during stay, likely due to infectious processand mulitple medications. pt was briefly icteric, but returnedquickly to normal state. labs remained at baseline elevation forthe remainder of his stay. pt received hepatitis a vaccination.the outpatient medication spironolactone has been discontinuedduring the hospital stay because the patient developed acuterenal failure. it was not restarted upon discharge. it isrecommended to discuss the restarting of spironolactone with hisliver team during follow up as an outpatient..11. hyponatremia: initially progressed to sodium of 124, butlater wnl. pt was euvolemic throughout his hospital stay. no rxwas necessary and sodium was stable at discharge..12. pos ucx: the patient had gnr growing from a ucx on [8-30]after having spiked a fever once the day before. the ua wasrepeatedly negative and the patient remained afebrilethereafter. a cxr was also negative and a repeat mri of thel-spine did not show any significant change to previous mris.the patient completed a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin andremained asymptomatic..13. htn: pt was normotensive with an episode of hypotension asdescribed above. bp medications were held and bp was monitoredthroughout his stay. it is recommended that his medications arestarted as an outpatient after monitoring his bp for hypotensionand reevaluating his hypertension..14. h/o alcohol abuse:  pt was monitored on ciwa, with prnativan..15. fen: cardiac/diabetic diet..16. prophylaxis: initially sc heparin, pneumoboots when offheparin. ambulatory towards the end of his stay. bowel regimen,ppi..17. access: picc placed on [8-15] and kept on discharge
