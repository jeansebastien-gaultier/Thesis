pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .neck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .lungs were clear .chest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .cardiovascular - normal .abdomen - normal .there was no hsm .extremities - her left arm was very swollen .it was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .there was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .neuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .she also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .cranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact .toes were downgoing .laboratory data :of note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .pt 13.8 with an inr of 1.3 , ptt 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .alt was elevated at 240 , ast 85 , ldh 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .ua - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .chest x-ray - showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .in summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca , status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics .so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done .another major issue with this patient was pain control .she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6-c7 interface on 1-6-94 .after that the patient had minimal relief of pain .however , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .so accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .in addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .that has been stable .the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic .her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .a renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as siadh .we proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .we had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .in addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.so that has really improved .we suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .on the 14th of january , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with hampton &apos;s hump .also a vq scan obtained the next day showed high probability for pe .so we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.her inr is 2.3 .we want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 .so if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .however , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .other major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .we put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .so on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .if needed to you can give her some nifedipine sl to decrease her blood pressure .the patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so i think that fluid restriction should help with that .she is also a little dry .the patient is on oxygen .ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .she was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .we would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .the complications that i have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .disposition :discharge medications - baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , mvi one tablet p.o. q.d. , mycostatin powder tp q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.condition on discharge :fair .she remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .she is to go to the necsoncardel medical center for more chronic care .follow-up is with dr. wedleung in the hem / onc in two weeks .the appointment has already been made .the patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .dictated by :jeabriharl figefreiermfothgrendcajaque , m.d.attending :la inemacistin prontmandes , m.d. hd45 sy882/1177batch :020index no.yjqi3j9vu6d :01/25/94t :01/25/94
