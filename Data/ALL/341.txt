( she was receiving 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. in hospital prior todischarge ).family history: history of a son with a myocardial infarction atage 39 , brother with an mi at age 64 , and a motherwith an mi at age 64.social history: she lives with her husband at home and does notsmoke tobacco.physical examination: vital signs - heart rate 59 , bp 100/60 ,respiratory rate 20 , sat 98 on three literswith temp 97.7. general - she was an elderly woman in no acutedistress. heent - oropharynx is benign. neck - she has normaljugular venous pressure at approximately 8 cm. chest - clear toauscultation and percussion. heart - remarkable for s1 and s2.regular rhythm , no murmurs. she had a surgical scar in the midlinewhich is healing without any pus or signs of inflammation. abdomen- benign. she had a midline scar which was healing withouterythema or pus. extremities - revealed a left lower extremitymedial scar with erythema but no pus. she had left-sided edema , 2+to the mid shin , but there was no edema on the right side. she had1-2+ decreased pulses bilaterally. her feet were cool but herneurologic function was intact. she had normal capillary refill.neuro - non-focal.laboratory data: bun 18 , creatinine 1.0 , with normal electrolytes.she had a white count 15 and hematocrit 40. herlfts were within normal limits , and her ck was 55. ekg , at thetime of admission here , showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 59 ,with intervals of 0.2 , 0.08 , and 484. she had a left axis of -34degrees and evidence of an old inferior mi. she had t-waveinversions in lead i , l , v2-v6 , and ii , and she had st elevations( slight ) in leads iii and f ). these were unchanged during herepisode of chest pain upon arrival compared with her ekg from themorning of discharge.hospital course: in short , this was a 72-year-old woman who wasstatus post coronary artery bypass grafting 12days prior to admission , who was now readmitted within four hoursof discharge because of rapid atrial fibrillation and chest painlasting for an hour.she was admitted and found to be in normal sinus rhythm at the timeof admission. her procainamide was increased to 750 mg p.o. q.i.d.given that her levels of proc/nepa were subtherapeutic at the timeof discharge earlier in the day. given her history of one hour ofchest pain , she was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serialcks which were flat. however , her troponin came back at 5.1 thefollowing morning. it rapidly trended downward , and so it wasunclear as to whether she had actually suffered any myocardialdamage. other possible explanations for her chest pain included:question of pericarditic , post-pericardiotomy pain vs. coronarydisease vs non-cardiac causes. in addition , at the time ofadmission , she had an infectious disease issue and her white bloodcell count was elevated at the outside hospital , and there was someerythema around her left leg site.on hospital day #2 , she had an episode of atrial fibrillation at arate of 140-150 with symptoms of palpitation but no chest pain.her proc and nepa levels were therapeutic at this time ( 6.0-9.0 ).on the following day , she had an episode of atypical chest painwithout ekg changes and which was different from her prior angina.the following evening , she had an additional episode of chest pain.at this time , she had a heart rate of approximately 160 and wasfound to be in atrial fibrillation with no st-t wave changes. thisepisode resolved with 2.5 mg of iv lopressor within 10 minutes.on 11/17/97 , she underwent an echocardiogram which showed a normallv size , with mild concentric hypertrophy. there was normalsystolic function and an ejection fraction of 66% , with inferiorhypokinesis. based on this information , it was decided that thepatient probably did not have an mi. at this time , the decisionwas made that she had failed procainamide , as she had now brokethrough several times with atrial fibrillation , well therapeutic onthe procainamide. the procainamide was discontinued and she wasloaded on amiodarone at a dosage of 600 mg p.o. t.i.d. x13 doses.on 10/10/97 , she underwent an ett mibi which showed mildperi-infarct ischemia but no st-t wave changes and the patient hadno symptoms at nine minutes on a submax bruce.at the time of discharge , she remained on amiodarone at a dose of200 mg p.o. q.d. and she has been restarted on her coumadin forwhich she will be followed by the anticoagulation service. at thetime of discharge , she has been in normal sinus rhythm for over 36hours. her other issues during this hospitalization havingincluded infectious disease for which she was on cephradine becauseof some wound site erythema and an elevated white blood cell countat an outside hospital. she was treated with five days ofcephradine and remained afebrile. in addition , she was started onlevofloxacin for concern about a uti , given her complaints ofurinary frequency. however , it is more likely that this urinaryfrequency is related to her underlying urologic problems. in termsof her anticoagulation , she was maintained on a iv heparin whilenot on coumadin. she is restarting with careful recoumadinizationgiven the fact that she is now on amiodarone.discharge medications: ( 1 ) aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 2 ) amiodarone200 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 3 ) atenolol 100 mg p.o.q.d.; ( 4 ) isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.; ( 5 ) sublingual nitroglycerinp.r.n.; ( 6 ) coumadin as directed; ( 7 ) axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.;( 8 ) ativan 0.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. anxiety; ( 9 ) premarin0.625 mg p.o. q.d.; ( 10 ) pravachol 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. she has nowbeen in sinus rhythm for over 36 hours. it seems likely that shewill not require long-term amiodarone or coumadin.discharge follow-up: the patient will follow-up with hercardiologist , dr. harry finnila , so that thedecision can be made as to when she may stop taking her amiodaroneand coumadin.discharge disposition: the patient was discharged to home on4/2/97.condition on discharge: stable condition.dictated by: ken murphy , m.d. bt34attending: greg setters , m.d. bc24xf715/9757batch: 77539 index no. biryab6tsb d: 3/1/97t: 2/29/97cc: 1. douglass wendy , m.d. bc242. winford d. mraz , m.d. jz2
