will d/w renal as to why not.4)	esrd - can go for hd today. need to contact dialysis unit to arrange time.5)	dm 2 - ssi for now, will likely give back lantus tonight. she is v reluctant to have ssi, will give at half usual doses.6)	fen cardiac, diabetic diet. hold npo pending possible cath in am.7)	prophylaxis: gi: nexium, dvt: heparin iv; bm: prn. 8)	dispo -
