[known lastname 70072] is a 71 yo male who with a pmh of hypertension andmi, who presents with back pain of 2 weeks duration.  he statesthat he first noticed that something was wrong a couple of weeksago, after eating eating ice cream and drinking ice water atnight.  later that night, after going to bed and falling asleep,he was woken with a strange feeling which he describes as acurtain descending down over his abdomen.  he states it felt asif his body, in the region of his abdomen, had just shut down.he fell back asleep the night, hoping that the strange feelingwould go away on its own.  over the next few days, he began tonotice a pain in his upper back.  he describes that pain assimilar to a muscle spasm, in his back, that does not radiate.when the pain first began, it was intermittent and could bebrought on by nearly anything, including getting up to walk andeating.  he tried advil and acetominophen which helped at firstto relieve his pain.  he noticed that his pain gradually becamemore intense, and more intolerable.  he reports occasional chestpain, shortness of breath, and feeling feverish when his painwould become severe. at the time of presentation to an osh, hispain was constant, not relieved with advil or acetominophen, andhe reports it as a [9-26].  he also developed a dry,non-productive cough over the past 2-3 days, and a feeling ofnausea that developed when he would cough.  at times, when thepain would become severe, he began to feel feverish anddeveloped sweats.  he reports that his last bowel movement wasnearly a week ago.  patient reports that he was in tripoli,north [country 480] in the [2044]'s during the korean war.  recalls oneepisode of walking pneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was nothospitalized.  recalls no episodes of hemoptysis.  he estimatesthat he has lost ~10 pounds over the past two months due todecreased appetite and pain with eating.  he denies chills,night sweats, changes in vision, headache, shortness of breath,chest pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, numbness,parasthesias.past medical history:## hypertension- not on medication## cataracts- repaired in right eye## mi- history of mi in '[83] and

protrusion withoutevidence of canal or foraminal stenosis.at c5-c6, there is a broad-based disc-osteophyte bar producingmoderate canal and moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.at c6-c7, there is mild retrolisthesis producing moderate canaland moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis.  there is no evidenceof abnormal cord signal or abnormal cord enhancement.impression:  multilevel degenerative disease as described..mri of the thoracic spine with gadolinium:impression:  paraspinal mass with vertebral body involvement att7-t8.  there is involvement of the disc, and there is anepidural mass.  the features in general suggest that this may bea malignant process rather than an active infection, althoughgranulomatous disease would be an additional consideration.  thefindings are a bit unusual for bacterial abscess, but this isnot entirely excluded..mri of the lumbar spine:impression:  first degree spondylolisthesis at l5-s1.  mild discbulging.  no evidence of focal disc protrusion.  no evidence ofa destructive mass or abscess in the lumbar region..ct t-spine w/o contrast [2100-11-30]:again seen is destruction of the inferior one-half of t7 andsuperior endplate of t8 with a large associated paraspinal mass. there is a small epidural component as well as retropulsion ofbone fragments into theventral part of the spinal canal.  the degree of cordcompression is better evaluated on the previous day's mri.again noted is kyphotic angulation of the thoracic spine at thislocale.  no new abnormalities are identified. there areemphysematous changes in the lungs.  aortic calcifications areidentified..ct abdomen/pelvis [2100-12-2]:ct abdomen:  the gallbladder is distended likely due to fasting. however,clinical correlation is recommended.  the liver, spleen, andpancreas areunremarkable.  the small 11-mm left adrenal gland nodule is notwellcharacterized in this study.  the right adrenal gland is normal. smallhypodense area at the interpolar region of the right kidney

brief, the patient is a 71 yo male with history of coccygealfracture, and cad, who presented with back pain of 2 weeksduration, found to have a t7-t8 epidural mass on mri. hesubsequently was found to have a mssa osteomyelolitis, underwentcolpectomy and fusion, however his course was complicated bypost-op nstemi, bradycardic arrest (complete heart block), upperextremity venous clot, and delerium..## epidural mass:patient presented with back pain of increasing severity of 2weeks duration, that he rated as [9-26] on admission. patient haddecreased patellar reflexes but no other focal neurologicaldeficits, and back was non-tender to palpation. no leg weakness,sensory deficits or bowel/bladder incontinence.  mri onadmission showed an epidural mass at t7-t8 level with somemoderate cord compression.  ct spine confirmed this finding.found to have elevated esr to 102 and crp of 216 concerning forinfectious process. based on imaging the differential of theepidural mass was infection (bacterial abscess vs tuburculoma),vs malignancy vs av malformation. the patient denied any historyor exposure to tb, however he was in north [country 480] in the [2044]'sduring the korean war. recalled one episode of walkingpneumonia, nearly 20 years ago, was not hospitalized. recalls noepisodes of hemoptysis. the patient denied any history ofmalignancy, however he has not seen a physician in many years.given the possibility of infection he was started onbroad-spectrum abx including ceftriaxone, vancomycin and flagyliv.  he was afebrile.  ortho spine followed the patient and hewas provided with a tlso brace given his t7 collapse.  serialneurological exams were performed looking for signs of cordcompression and were normal.  on [12-3] the patient underwentct-guided biopsy of the mass and tissue was sent to microbiology and pathology.  gram stain and culture returned positive forgpc.  id was consulted for further recommendations.  whenorganisms were identified as staph aureus the ceftriaxone andflagyl were discontinued.  he was continued on vancomycin withgoal troughs 17-20.  when sensitivities returned mssa thevancomycin was switched to nafcillin 2gm iv q4h..id recommended tte given epidural abscess and murmur on exam(unclear age given no regular medical care).  tte showed noevidence of endocarditis with no vegetations or abscesses.  atee was not performed given the patient would require a longcourse of antibiotics and tee would not change the management.a ppd was also placed given tuburculoma was in the differentialand was negative.  additionally, afb smear and stain were bothnegative.  afb culture is pending.  there was no evidence ofgranulomas on cxr or chest ct suggestive of old tb infection..although the patient appeared to have an mssa abscess, anunderlying process could not be excluded.  given possibility forunderlying malignancy an spep/upep were sent. psa was 1.0 andchest ct showed no lung nodules. path of epidural biopsy showedinflammation. given the location of the abscess and involvementof t7-t8 vertebrae with t7 collapse, the patient was taken tothe or for surgical spine debridement/stabilization by orthospine. he underwent two surgical procedures to debride andstabilize his spine (please see op notes from [12-10] and [12-13]for details).  he should complete a 6 week course of nafcillinto end on [2101-1-20].  he has follow up with [hospital ] clinic on[2101-1-5] and may need lifelong suppressive therapy..## ntemi - two days after his second surgery, the patientdeveloped chest pain.  an ekg revealed lateral st depressions.the pain was relieved by nitroglycerine complicated by mildhypotension.  his cardiac enzymes were positive with a troponint peak of 0.27. his cpk-mb was also mildly elevated to 12.  hewas conservatively managed particularly with regard to hisrecent spine surgery.  his cardiac regimen was adjusted toinclude aspirin, beta-blocker, ace inhibitor, and imdur..## cardiac arrest - the patient's course was further complicatedby a bradycardic arrest leading to asystole.  this episode wasnot captured on telemetry. he received cpr as his dnr status hadtemporarily been changed peri-operative.  he was resuscitatedsuccessfully without use of epinephrine, atropine, orelectricity.  he was initially stabilized after transfer to theccu but had a similar arrest twice the next morning eachfollowing repositioning. telemetry revealed complete heartblock. an externalized pacemaker was placed with a screw-in lead inthe rv as putting a permanent pacer in while the osteomyelitiswas being treated.  the bradycardia appears to have beentriggered by excessive vagal tone.  the day before discharge aperm. pacemaker was placed and was interrogated by ep and foundto be working well.  he has follow up on [2101-1-5] with thedevice clinic to further evaluate the pacer..## anemia: patient was found to be anemic on admission.  nobaseline for comparison.  fe studies suggestive of anemia ofchronic disease.  patient reports no hemoptysis,hematemesis,melena, or hematochezia. ebl from the surgery was~500cc.  late into his ccu stay, he developed guaiac positivestool.  his hct stabilized after transfusion.  he continued on appi.  he can follow-up with his pcp for potential referral to gifor colonoscopy as an outpatient..## delirium: the patient developed delirium attributed tomedications (narcotics and benzodiazepines), and disruption insleep-wake cycle and ccu psychosis.  he was found not to havecapacity to refuse life saving interventions.  his daughter[name (ni) 2127] [name (ni) 70073] was appointed health care proxy.  the patient'sagitation was managed with nightly haldol with as needed haldolas well.  other sedating medications such as narcotics andbenzodiazepines should be avoided as much as possible. once hewas transferred to the regular medical floor his deliriumimproved and by discharge he no longer displayed any signs ofdelirium..## constipation/diarrhea:  patient had not had a bowel movementin over a week when he presented.  he was started on anaggressive bowel regimen given constipation and requirement oflarge amount of narcotics.  this bowel regimen was weaned downover the course of his hospital stay.  since being on theantibiotics, he has developed diarrhea and has a rectal tube inplace. the diarrhea could be from an infectious source vs. theantibiotics themselves.  he was tested for c diff and found tobe negative x3.  a c diff b toxin has been sent and will befollowed up after discharge..## hypertension:  patient has a history of hypertension but hadnever been treated. bp was initially labile and elevatedreadings seemed to correlate with pain.  when pain was bettercontrolled the patient's bp remained elevated with sbp 140-150at times.  his blood pressure was controlled as above..## iliac artery dissections: incidental finding on ct. vascularconsult obtained. no evidence of peripheral vascular compromise. vascular team recommended outpatient follow up in 6 months withultrasound..## upper extremitiy dvt - the patient developed a clot in theright cephalic vein in the setting of a rij central venouscatheter.  he was initially anticoagulated but this was held inthe setting of the gib.  warm compresses and arm elevationshould be used to limit propagation of the clot.  the patienthad a cta of

pneumonia (no fever,normalizing wbc, no definitive consolidation on imaging).antibiotics, levofloxicin, directed at this bacteria werestarted when he was noted to have an infiltrate on cxr and someshortness of breath. he also developed a large pleural effusionand underwent a thorocentesis.  the fluid was exudative andlikely related to the pneumonia although the gram stain wasnegative (he has been on antibiotics).  the cytology is stillpending and should be followed up by his pcp..## elevated creatinine - creatinine was 1.6 on admission.corrected following ivf..## prophylaxis: ppi,
