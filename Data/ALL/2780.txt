mdchief complaint:an 86-year-old female with diabetes , end-stage renal disease onhemodialysis , coronary artery disease , hypertension , history ofrecent cva , presents with hypotension and shock , question ofsepsis.history of present illness:the patient , as mentioned above an 86-year-old with history ofend-stage renal disease , insulin dependent diabetes , cad statuspost mi , bilateral above the knee amputations secondary toperipheral vascular disease , cerebrovascular accident in 10/18 ,who was initially admitted on 10/26/05 for nausea , vomiting , anddiaphoresis. previously , the patient was admitted to sourceshcate naj. hospitalfor vertigo that was consistent with a right pontine lacunarinfarct , but despite being on plavix and aspirin that was in10/18 .  her hospital course was complicated by an mi , and thepatient was medically managed. the patient was again admitted tothe crny'ssha medical center on 5/18/05 for hypotension and unresponsivenessafter dialysis. she had negative ct at that point. since thatadmission , she had been doing well until 10/26/05 when she hadnausea vomiting and diaphoresis following hemodialysis. she wasadmitted to rule out cardiac cause versus infection. herhospital course was complicated by continued hypotension anddecreased temperature. in the emergency department , onpresentation , the patient had a temperature of 95.8 , heart rateof 102. her blood pressure was 83 to 122 over 40s to 60s. herrespiratory rate was 16. she was sating 95% on room air. shegot 500 mg of levofloxacin and her lopressor was held due tohypotension , and she was admitted with concern for infectiousprocess. she was initially admitted to the floor where she wasfound to be afebrile with the rate of 92 , respirations of 20 , andblood pressure was 100/57. her exam revealed bibasilar rales ,left greater than the right. her abdominal exam revealednontender and nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.her extremities revealed warm. she had bilateral below the kneeamputations. her cardiovascular exam revealed regular rate andrhythm with the 2/6 systolic murmur.past medical history:significant for chronic renal insufficiency , end-stage renaldisease on hemodialysis , insulin-dependent diabetes , cva ,bilateral below the knee amputations , cad , status post mi in10/18 , hypertension , and peripheral vascular disease.medications:folate 1 mg daily , aspirin 81 mg daily , nph , isordil , lisinopril ,plavix 75 mg , paxil 10 mg , pravachol 20 mg , neurontin , protonix40 mg , vitamin b12 100 mcg , and nephrocaps.social history:she lives

data:significant for ck of 39 , mb of 2.3 , and troponin of 0.36. herwhite count was 8. her hematocrit was 36.2 , and her plateletswere 298 , 000. her inr was 1.3. her ekg revealed a regular rateand rhythm. normal axis. t-wave inversions and flattenings inthe lateral leads on low voltage in the limb leads. her chestx-ray showed left lower lobe consolidation and left effusion.impression:an 86-year-old female with end-stage renal disease onhemodialysis , presenting with episodes of nausea , vomiting , anddiaphoresis of unclear etiology.hospital course by system:cardiovascular: upon admission , the patient had a slighttroponin leak. it was unclear for initial presenting symptoms orsubsequent secondary to ischemia. on her second hospital day ,she developed hypotension. initially , her systolic bloodpressure dropped to the 80s and her blood pressure medicines wereheld. subsequently , her blood pressure dropped into the 70s andshe required dopamine and was transferred to the cardiac careunit. in the cardiac care unit , she was started on the dopaminedrip of 10 mcg/kg/minute. in the cardiac care unit , the initialdifferential diagnoses were hypertension was cardiogenic versusseptic physiology. however , her white count revealed significantelevation of 24.6 with bandemia , 10% bands. she also had anelevated lactate of 9.3 concerning for gi etiology. possibly gutischemia was the cause of her infection. she was covered broadlywith amp , vanc , levo , and flagyl. she subsequently required theaddition of neo-synephrine as a second pressor agent to maintainher blood pressure. dopamine was weaned off. however , on thesecond day in the ccu , on 9/26/05 , the patient developed suddenhypotension. physicians were called to see the patient and atthat time she was found to have no palpable pulse. code wasinitiated. the patient was found to be in pulseless electricalactivity. chest compressions were initiated , and she was maskventilated , and she received multiple rounds of epinephrine andatropine. she received 2 amps of bicarbonate and 1 amp ofcalcium gluconate given concern for hyperkalemia in the settingof end-stage renal disease. anesthesia then arrived and thepatient was intubated. despite all efforts , the patient's rhythmdeteriorated to asystole , and she was pronounced dead at 5:30p.m. on 9/26/05 , which was the time of death.escription
