present illness:84 yo male with multiple medical problems, includinghypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cad, and history of cva'swho presented to the ed with a 24 history of weakness, cough,sob and nausea. he denied fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominalpain. emesis x 1 that am. in ed he was found to be hypoxemic w/sats 85% on ra, pulmonary edema on cxr and sbp in the 80's. onpresentation, however, the patient was alert and oriented,appropriate and mentating well. he initially received 2l ns forivf hydration, as well as antibiotics including ceftriaxone,azithromycin, vancomycin for suspected community acquiredpneumonia. the patient then went into rapid afib with hr in the140's. he was given 5 mg lopressor iv and his hr decreased to100. however, the patient's respiratory status declinedprecipitously and his sats dipped to 86% on a 100% face mask. hewas placed on a nonrebreather and subsequently intubated in thesetting of impending respiratory failure. peri-intubation thepatient again became hypotensive with sbp in the 80-60's and wasstarted on dopamine and dilt for rate control. after intubationand central line placement, the patient was transferred to themicu and admitted with a running diagnosis of sepsis caused byan underlying community acquired pneumonia.although the patient had a extensive medical history and problemlist, prior to presentation and subsequent admission to thehospital he was fairly independent and ambulatory, living athome with his wife.past medical history:1. hypertension2. hypercholesterolemia3.  acromegaly since [2108]4.

[known lastname ] has a peg tube and was tolerating tubefeeds using respalor full strength at 50cc/hr.  vit c and zincwere added per nutrition recommendations.8. endocrine: mr. [known lastname ] has known panhypopituitarism. he wasadmitted on prednisone 5 mg daily (home dose). he requiredstress dose steroids for his adrenal, subsequently tapered to 20mg po daily, on which he remains at the time of discharge.regarding his diabetes, serum glucose was well controlled on aninsulin sliding scale starting with 5 units for fsg > 150 andincrementing by 2 units.9. hematology: he had thrombocytopenia initially on admission.hit antibody was negative. his thrombocytopenia was subsequentlyattributed to linezolid, and resolved several days afterlinezolid was discontinued. platelet count 170s on day ofdischarge.10. prophylaxis: pt was treated with carafate for gi prophylaxis(given thrombocytopenia) and heparin sq for dvt prophylaxis.11. physical therapy: pt was felt to be progressing well from apt standpoint. he will need continued aggressive pt follow-up.12. access: a right subclavian was placed on [2162-11-14] and a piccline was placed on [2162-11-30].medications on admission:metoprolol 12.5 mg [hospital1 ]ecasa 325 mg dailyplavix 75 mg dailyfolic acid 2 mg [hospital1 ]zocor 30 mg qhsvit b6 100 mg dailyvit b12 100 mcg dailycaco3mvimeclizine prnvitamin eprednisone 5 mg dailytemezepam prndischarge medications:1. furosemide 40 mg iv bid2. heparin 5000 unit sc tid3. metolazone 5 mg po bid4. vancomycin hcl 1000 mg iv q24h (please hold vanco for randomlevel >20)5. meclizine hcl 12.5 mg po q8h:prn6. amiodarone hcl 200 mg po daily7. digoxin 0.125 mg po daily8. ceftazidime 2 gm iv q8h  [11-23]9. captopril 12.5 mg po tid (hold for map<50)  [11-20]10. ascorbic acid 500 mg po bid  [11-19]11. zinc sulfate 220 mg po daily  [11-19]12. morphine sulfate 2-4 mg iv q2h:prn  [11-18]13. psyllium 1 pkt po tid:prn  [11-16]14. haloperidol 2.5-5 mg iv bid:prn agitation  [11-14]15. haloperidol 2.5 mg po tid  [11-14]16. oxybutynin 5 mg po bid:prn  [11-13]17. insulin sc  (per insulin flowsheet)18. bisacodyl 10 mg po/pr [hospital1 ]:prn (hold for diarrhea)  [11-10]19. lactulose 30 ml po q8h:prn (hold for diarrhea)  [11-10]20. senna 1 tab po bid:prn (hold for diarrhea)  [11-10]21. nystatin oral suspension 5 ml po qid:prn  [11-10]22. miconazole powder 2% 1 appl tp qid groin [female first name (un) ]  [11-10]23. milk of magnesia 30 ml po q6h:prn  [11-10]24. simethicone 40-80 mg po qid:prn  [11-10]25. acetaminophen 325-650 mg po q4-6h:prn  [11-10]26. sucralfate 1 gm po qid  [11-10] @ 2126 view27. prednisone 20 mg po daily  [11-10]28. cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg po qd  [11-10]30. docusate sodium (liquid) 100 mg po bid31. simvastatin 30 mg po qhs32. folic acid 3 mg po bid33. thiamine hcl 100 mg po/ng daily34. artificial tears 1-2 drop ou prn35. albuterol-ipratropium [12-11] puff ih q4h:prndischarge disposition:extended caredischarge diagnosis:1)respiratory failure2)congestive heart failure3)mitral regurgitation4)community-acquired pneumonia5)ventilator associated pneumonia6)tracheostomy7)anemia8)thrombocytopenia9)hypopituitarismdischarge condition:fairdischarge instructions:to [hospital6 ]followup instructions:follow up with dr.
