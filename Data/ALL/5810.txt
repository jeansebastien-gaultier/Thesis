[last name (stitle) ]continued to follow.  in the icu he was found to have guiaic positive ngtsecretions.  he was transfused prbcs for a dropping hct.  inaddition he was noted to have an elevated inr for which he wastreated with ffp.  he was evaluated by surgery who felt him tobe a poor surgical candidate.  for his confusion a ct of hishead was performed which was negative for bleed or other change. his hypoxia resolved and was felt to be due to aspirationinitially.  he was treated with tpn given his poor nutritionalstatus.  he was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with noimprovement.  on [2120-10-18] a family meeting was held at whichtime it was decided that the goal of care was maximal comfort.at that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids andanalgesia but to limit other medications and tpn.  the familywill provide chinese herbs and prayer..# gi: diarrhea was believed to be chemo-induced diarrhea.  thepatient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl givenneutropenic fever.  the ct of abdomen on admission did not showany inflammatory processes in the abdomen. the patient was givensupportive care with ivf and lomotil once obtained stool samplesfor cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved withlomotil.  however, patient became acidotic and ct abdomen wasrepeated and revealed sbo. ngt was placed and surgey wasconsulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgicalcandidate. patient was continued on medical management.octreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieveobstruction. his lactate continued to trend down and ngt outoutbegan to slow. patient denied any abdominal pain.    however, while in the icu he developed bloody stools in thesetting of coagulopathy. this was felt to be likely secondary tohis rectal cancer. he was tranfused prbcs and ffp. after severalbloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowelmovements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit wasstable..coagulopathy: likely dic secondary to cancer. he devloped gibleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of ffpand prbcs and 1 unit of platelets. by tranfer from the icu hishct and inr was stable but platelets were 34. the patient andfamily did not want any further transfusions as their goal wascomfort and this would require daily monitoring of his cbc andcoags..# neutropenic fever: the patient was started on cefepime, vanco,and flagyl on admission. he had some fevers early in hishospitalization but remained afebrile for the rest of hisadmission. he because hypoxic and acidotic and a ct chest wasotained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia. he wascontinue on his antibiotics to complete a 14 day course andreceived daily neupogen injections. by the 11th day of hisantibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic. his neupogen wasdiscontinued and he remained afebrile.# ag metabolic acidosis: concerning for lactic acidosis [1-24] tohypovolemia.  patient refused central line/sepsis protocol ined. he was  hemodynamically stable on transfer to the floor.lactate normalized after ivf. then the patient continued to havenon-anion gap acidosis [1-24] to diarrhea.  abg was obtained andthe patient appropriately compensated with decreased co2 (25)with normal ph 7.4-7.44. he then became more hypoxic and acidotcand was tranferred to the icu. in the icu it was discoved thathe had an extremely dilated stomach and sbo. it was felt thatthe lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extremedistension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactateon decompression with ngt. his gap closed and his lactateconitnued to tened down..# rectal cancer: last chemotherapy was last avastin/5fu on [9-25].given that he did not tolerate this well, no furtherchemotherapy was planned. he also developed what is believed tobe lower gi bleed, sbo and dic during admission all which werethaough to be related to his metastatic disease. due to his poorprognosis and worsening medical condition a family meeting washeld and the family and patient agreed that comfort was the mostimportant goal at this point. he was continued on ivf and thenggt was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his sbo.it was decided that no further blood products would be given..fen: patient was actively hydrated in the setting of diarrheaand acidosis. he was continued on ivf given his sbo. given hispoor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not startedon tpn, but rather hydrated with ivf in the setting of sbo.medications on admission:1. aspirin
