posterior circulations with newlydeveloped foci of acute infarct between 1 and 14 days days oldthat suggests ongoing embolism. cardiac , aortic or carotidsource of emboli should be considered.2. focal

as described , novisualization of the proximal and mid segment of the nondominantright vertebral artery as described.6/25/07 echocardiogram: the left ventricle is normal in size ,overall left ventricular function is normal. the estimatedejection fraction is 55-60%. there were no regional wall motionabnormalities. there was no left ventricular thrombus detected.the aortic root size was normal. there was no cardiac source ofembolus identified and compared with prior study on 9/26/07 and2/23/07 , there was no significant change.hospital course: ms. mundhenk is a 72-year-old woman withmultiple medical problems including severe vasculopathy ( carotidstenosis and renal artery stenosis status post renal artery stentplacement in 11/22 ) , diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia andmultiple strokes. she was admitted to an outside hospital withunresponsiveness. she was transferred here for management of hersevere hypertension and worsening kidney function. during thishospital admission , her medications were adjusted. initially ,the nitro paste was stopped. the lasix was held. her minoxidilwas also stopped as well. she was continued on clonidine 0.2 mgp.o. b.i.d. and norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily. lopressor was alsostopped during this hospital admission and labetalol was started ,which was titrated up by the time of this dictation. herantihypertensives include labetalol 300 mg p.o. q.8 h. , norvasc10 mg p.o. daily and clonidine 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d. it is veryimportant that the patient receive her medications at theirscheduled times or her blood pressure will rise. she continuedto complain of headache , particularly on the right side and asdetailed above carotid ultrasound revealed a tight right internalcarotid artery stenosis. vascular surgery was consulted and sheis currently scheduled to have a left endarterectomy on friday ,9/16/07 after which point she will be cared for by the vascularsurgery service. given the patient's kidney disease and severehypertension in addition to recent renal artery stent placement ,nephrology was consulted as well during her hospital stay. itwas felt that there was no need for intervention regarding herrenal arteries or visualization of her kidneys at this time.they agreed with holding the furosemide and changing lopressor tolabetalol and titrating up labetalol as needed. her clonidinecould also be titrated up by 0.1 mg increments should she needmore blood pressure control in the future , if her heart ratedoes not tolerate higher doses of labetalol. the patient'screatinine on admission was 2.6 , which subsequently decreased to2 , however , at the time of this dictation has increased to 2.6and it is thought that this may be a result of improved bloodpressure control and may be a new baseline; her creatinine willneed to be followed. the patient also has a history of diabetesand is on insulin and her insulin regimen including nph and accoverage were titrated during this hospital admission.hemoglobin a1c was checked during this hospital admission and itwas 6.4. tsh was checked as well and it was within normallimits.contact numbers: contact numbers for the patient's
