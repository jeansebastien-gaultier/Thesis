on november , 1999 , the patient's hematocrit was31.9 , and platelets 279. echocardiogram from july of 1999 hadmoderate to severe left ventricular hypertrophy , ejection fractionof 55% , borderline hypokinetic inferior left ventricular wall , mildmitral regurgitation , and left atrial dilatation. carotidnoninvasives from march of 1999 showed no significant right orleft internal carotid stenosis.hospital course: this is a 50 year old woman with a history ofend stage renal disease , status post renaltransplant in february of 1997 , history of insulin dependent diabetesmellitus , coronary artery disease , status post coronary arterybypass grafting in 1996 ( left internal mammary artery to leftanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal ) ,now with episodes of rapid heart rate and episodes of skipped beatsin association without shortness of breath. also , the patient hashad a hematocrit drop from 31 to 26 on admission and a history ofblood in stool over the last month. the patient was guaiaced onadmission and during her stay and remained guaiac negativethroughout the whole time. the patient was placed on cardiacmonitoring and had no events recorded on the monitor. on july , 2000 , the patient's hematocrit dropped to 21. she wastransfused two units of blood and her hematocrit went up to 31. anexercise tolerance test mibi was performed which was negative forischemia. the patient's ejection fraction from the mibi wasapproximated to be 69%. on november , 2000 , carotidnon-invasives were repeated which revealed moderate internalcarotid plaque on the right. otherwise , she had mild stenosis ofthe other arteries. an echocardiogram was also performed whichrevealed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejectionfraction of 65%. the patient was taken to electrophysiology studyon march , 2000 which revealed nonsustained ventriculartachycardia with possible right ventricular outflow tract origin.it was hoped that she could be maintained on lopressor andverapamil. due to the results of this study , the patient wasalready on atenolol for beta blockade and verapamil was tried.however , her blood pressure did not tolerate this medication. theday after the electrophysiology procedure on january , 2000 , thepatient was orthostatic. she was given a 250 cc fluid bolus andencouraged to drink more p.o. fluids and she was discharged instable condition the next day. the patient remained symptom freeduring the entire hospital course. the patient's triglycerideswere checked during the hospitalization and found to be very highin the 1 , 500 range. the patient was therefore taken offsimvastatin and started on gemfibrozil.discharge medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg p.o. q. day. 2. vitaminc 100 mg p.o. q. day x14 days. 3. epogen2 , 000 subcu q. week. 4. lasix 60 mg p.o. q. day. 5. gemfibrozil300 mg p.o. b.i.d. 6. lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day. 7. prilosec20 mg p.o. q. day. 8. prednisone 5 mg p.o. on even days , 10 mgp.o. on odd days. 9. mvi with minerals one tablet p.o. q. day.10. thiamine 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. 11. bicitra 15 ml p.o. b.i.d.12. cyclosporine micromeral 125 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 100 mg p.o. q.p.m. 13. cellcept 1 , 000 mg p.o. b.i.d. 14. prempro 0.625/0.25mg p.o. q. day. 15. nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q. day.dictated by: brain linman , m.d. ja25attending: sydney duesterhaus , m.d. mg85  eq681/3978batch: 37609 index no. fhow8875s8 d: 6/10t: 1/22[report_end]
