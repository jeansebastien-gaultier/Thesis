diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute closed angle glaucoma and nausea and vomiting. 1.	glaucoma.likely secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  as recommended by the ophthalmologic consultant, i will give the following meds	-xalatan qhs-pred forte qid-timolol bid-trusopt bid-acetazolamide bid-alphaganiop will be monitored closely.  if it does not trend down, the patient may need surgery in the am.2.	nausea and vomitingthe differential diagnosis is broad and includes symptoms related to glaucoma, atypical angina, symptoms from an sbo given her history, chemical pancreatitis and viral gastroenteritis.  of these, i believe that symptoms from glaucoma or gastroenteritis is most likely.  -	i ordered a kub on the floor which showed normal bowel gas per unofficial rads read.  -	i think angina is unlikely given her history.  however, i believe that she needs a stress test given her severe diabetes.  i will be unable to arrange one for tomorrow (weekend day), but i believe she needs one as an out patient study in the near future.  i will give asa, b blocker and ace.  i will not give heparin given that her timi score is only 1. -	chemical pancreatitis is possible although her exam is so bengin. i will therefore give pt full liqs tonight and follow her for pancreatitis symptoms.3.	chronic renal failurethis is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy. pt is at baseline creatinine4.	anemiapt is at baseline creatinine.  she was found to have sickle cell trait.  iron studies, b12, folate wnl. hct stable5.	diabeteswill continue
