effusions, large on the right andmoderate on the left.3. focal enhancement in the posterior spleen on delayed phaseimages,possible hemangioma or av malformation.brief hospital course:[age over 90 ] year old male with a pmh of a-fib and dchf on coumadin andaspirin who presented with a lower gi bleed in the setting of asupratherapeutic inr.active issues:gi bleed: likely due to known severe diverticulosis, exacerbatedby supratherapeutic inr from coumadin, as well as being onaspirin.  source is most likely lower given brbpr mixed withstool. however, his bun/cr ratio was elevated, though thisrelationship has been present in historical blood draws. he wasgiven ffp and 10 mg vitamin k in the ed and subsequently sent tothe micu. he had a maroon bowel movement x1 in the micu andreceived 2 units prbcs with an appropriate increase. cta showeddiverticulosis with no signs of active bleeding.  his vitals andhematocrit remained stable, no further episodes of bloody bowelmovements.  the patient was offered colonoscopy, however upondiscussion with his son, he decided that he would rather notundergo the procedure.  given that he was medically stable andhis bleed was likely due to diverticulosis in the setting ofsupratherapeutic inr, this seemed a perfectly reasonable choice. he was warned, however, that the cta could not adequately ruleout other sources of bleeding such as avm or new malignancy thathas evolved since last colonoscopy in [2178] (though this isunlikely).  he should follow up with his pcp as an outpatient tohave hematocrit checked and ensure that he is no longer havingblood in his bms.atrial fibrillation: has a history of a-fib, and has been oncoumadin since [2185] (chads2 score is 2). mildly supratherapeuticinr to 3.6 in ed. in setting of lgib, inr was reversed withvitamin k and ffp.  coumadin held while inpatient, continuedrate control w metoprolol. the patient was instructed to notrestart the coumadin until his follow up with pcp, [name10 (nameis) 3] he willneed to discuss with him the risks/benefits of continuingcoumadin in the the setting of gi bleed.inactive issues:diastolic chf, chronic: appeared euvolemic with a stable rightsided pleural effusion. given gi bleed, lasix, lisinopril(recently dc'd) and metoprolol were initially held.  metoprololrestarted at half dose, lasix and lisinopril were not restartedon discharge.  defer decision on restarting to pcp.transfer of care issues:- gi bleed: recheck hgb/hct as outpatient, consider outpatientcolonoscopy if patient continues to have blood w his bms- coumadin:  assess risks and benefits prior to restarting.because his inr was reversed and coumadin stopped, he will needheparin bridging if he is to restart therapy.medications on admission:furosemide 20 mg tablet; 0.5 tabs

instructions:dear mr. [last name (titles) 101773],you were admitted to the [hospital1 18] because of bleeding with yourstool. you required transfusions of blood and blood products.you had a high inr - or coumadin level. we believe that this inrcontributed to the bleeding but the [last name ] problem was likely inthe colon, possibly diverticulosis. we discussed the risks andbenefits of a colonoscopy and ultimately you decided to discussthis with your regular doctors.moving forward, we ask you to do the following:1. stop coumadin2. stop lisinopril3. reduce the dose of your metoprolol to a half pill twice daily(12.5 mg)4. stop lasix (at least until your primary care appointment)weigh yourself every morning, [name8 (md) 138] md if weight goes up morethan 3 lbs.followup instructions:department: [state ]when: friday [2188-9-12] at 10:00 amwith: [first name11 (name pattern1) ] [last name (namepattern4) 8428], md [telephone/fax (1) 2205]building: [state ] ([location (un) ], ma) [location (un) ]campus: off campus     best parking: on street parkingthis is a follow up appointment of your hospitalization. youwill be reconnected with your primary care physician after thisvisit.department: cardiac serviceswhen: monday [2188-10-6] at 9:00 amwith: dr.
