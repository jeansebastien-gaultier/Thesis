(namepattern1) 554] [hospital3 ], with medical history pertinent forparkinson's disease, diabetes, and recent cornea transplant whonow presents with altered mental status.per last progress note from patient's pcp, [name10 (nameis) ] patient has beenin her usual state of health with exception of management of acervical vertebral fracture secondary to fall as well as plansfor a repat penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) s/pfailed prior. the patient was at that time apparently at herbaseline and cleared for surgery. the patient underwentpenetrating keratoplasty on [2119-3-30] for indication of failedgraft without complication. the patient was seen by herophthalmologist on [2119-4-4] with impression that there wasmoderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but nodischarge to suggest infection. polysporin was discontinued(with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter)and other meds (pred 1% tid os, timolol 0.5% [hospital1 ] ou, xalatan qhsos, tobradex[doctor last name ] os qhs) continued.the patient now presents form her [hospital3 ] with concernfor altered mental status. only limited information is availablefrom available staff at [hospital3 400], with report only thatpatient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and "not makingsense". per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patientwas in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning,looking well. later in the day, the patient was reported to bewalking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. thepatient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet.recommendation was made that patient be sent to hospital forfurther evaluation. per discussion with daughter, the patienthas had prior episodes of confusion in setting of

attempted givenpoor piv access for which the patient received haldol. nodocumentation of dose is available, [name8 (md) ] rn to rn signout thiswas 5mg iv. central line was not successfully placed andultimately a 22 piv in the hand was obtained.the patient had a negative ua, cxr without obvious infiltratealthough limited. ophthalmology was not contact[name (ni) ] as [name (ni) ]impression was that eye was not infected. lp was recommended byed but patients' daughter declined this. the patient was givenazithromycin, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone empirically and is nowadmitted to the medical service for ongoing care.on arrival to floor patient is lethargic but wakes to voice. sheanswers questions although requires repeat questioning at timesto wake her. patient reports mild neck pain

indentation on the right internal jugular vein extendingdown along the carotid space, into the region of the thoracicinlet. this may relate to inflammation, phlegmon, andradiation-related changes if there is history of radiation inthe past and less likely neoplastic. close followup evaluation,with ultrasound can be considered to evaluate for any abscess,given the patient's symptoms of fever.ct

gadolinium. 3d time-of-flight mrarteriographywas also performed. volume-rendering reconstructed images wereevaluated.mri of the brain and mra of the brain: there is no evidence ofintracranialhemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or regions of restricteddiffusion to suggestacute infarction. a few scattered periventricular t2/flairhyperintensitiesare noted, which are nonspecific but likely suggest chronicsmall vesselischemia. there are also adjacent prominent virchow-[doctor first name ]spaces. whilethere is underlying global cerebral atrophy, the degree ofdilatation of theventricular system may be somewhat disproportionate to theamount of centralatrophy. small amount of fluid is noted in the mastoidsbilateral.mr arteriography of the circle of [location (un) 431] displays no aneurysmaldilatation.mild atherosclerosis is noted in the right m1 segment. posteriorcirculationis left dominant.impression:1. no evidence of acute infarction. scattered changes

isnonspecific, in the appropriate clinical scenario it may reflectunderlyingnph.brief hospital course:this pt is a 88yo female w h/o parkinson's disease, milddementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospitalfor ams and to the icu for airway narrowing..# airway narrowing: she was noted to have swelling of the tongueand lower lips on admission. a ct of the head and neck with ivcontrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ?of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. over courseof day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds withgood o2 sat of 97% on 2l which has been stable. ent wasconsulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling inoropharynx with patent airway. swelling around false cords,tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. the team thoughtthe swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction tomedications. she was started on solumedrol 60iv and famotidine20mg. she was given one dose of zosyn and then switched tounasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. pt withoutleukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ed but afebrile since), orabcess. ent and anesthesia recommended transfer to icu forfurther monitoring. she was monitored and continued on decadronfor three doses. during successive scopes by ent, oropharyngealedema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent.unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectiousprocess vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious andlower airway appears more edematous and less infectious.lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visiblyimproved by the time she was called out to the floor.-pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection andswitched to augmentin for additional 5 days at dc-ent follow up appt was set up# s/p corneal tp: lid edema on exam. ophtho believes likelysecondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due toallergy.  ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommendeddecreasing doses of eye drops.-fu appt with optho set up.#. altered mental status: on admission, she was lethargic,possibly from the haldol she received in the ed. by the time shewas called out of the icu, she was likely at her baseline mentalstatus, pleasant and easily conversant. shortely thereafter,however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mghaldol and later the same day 5mg of zyprexa. she remainedagitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic andbarely arousable. head ct was unchanged from before. she had nothad any new fevers or new signs of infection. she had a lumbarpuncture that was unremarkable. mri/mra was neg except for someventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which wasdifficult to differentiate from nph. neurology thought it wasunlikely to be nph. eeg showed some focal acitivity concerningfor sublinical seizures. pt was started on keppra, initiallycontinued to have periods of somnolence along with r sidedfacial droop (which was thought be neurology to represent apost-ictal state with [doctor last name 555] paralysis) but day before dischargehad significant improvement in mental status and was alert andconversive. due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactivedelirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significantimprovement in level of alertness.-pt curently is on keppra 1000mg [hospital1 ] for one week and to beincreased to 1500mg [hospital1 ] later and kept at that dose.-pt should be followed by a neurologist at [hospital 100] rehab-outpt fu w neurology is already set up.#. uti: grew enterococcus in ucx. she was continued on unasynfor 10 days..#. positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negativestaph. this was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped.repeat blood cultures were negative.#. parkinson's disease: continued sinemet except when patientwas too lethargic to safely take meds.#. hypertension, benign: lisinopril was stopped due to concernof angioedema. atenolol was continued..#. hyperlipidemia: continued statin.#. hypothyroidism:  tsh normal on [2119-4-6] so not a picture ofmyxedema and cannot account for ms change. continuedlevothyroxine.#. diabetes ii, diet controlled without complication:- insulin sliding scale while inpatient  and bs were wnl. pt canhave [hospital1 ] finger checks to rehab but since not needing insulin,does not have to be on sliding scale# deconditioning: per pt eval, pt was 2 person assist and willneed significant pt therapy to get back to baseline where shewas walking with a walkermedications on
