support of her trunk and was able to transfer to a chair .the patient was eating a dysphagia 2 diet .her hemineglect syndrome had improved considerably .doctors discharge orders :the patient is to have rehabilitation in villtionnca hospital .medications on discharge :multivitamins 1 tablet po q am , vitamin c 500 mg po b.i.d. , colace 100 mg po b.i.d. , metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d. , furosemide
