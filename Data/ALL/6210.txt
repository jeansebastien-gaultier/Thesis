multiple medical problems including chronicsystolic chf, interstitial lung disease, copd (baseline 2l nc atnight), ckd, and pvd presenting with sudden onset of sob 7amthis morning and bloody, frothy sputum. patient reports feelingwell yesterday and rather acute development of this this am. hedenies any fevers or chills prior to arriving in the ed. hedenies any other localizing symptoms of infection likey dysuria,diarrhea, or abdominal pain. he [first name3 (lf) 653] ems for his dyspneaand was put on 100% nrb oxygen and brought to the ed.in the ed, initial vs were: t 100.4 (102 rectal), p 80, bp165/71, rr 34, o2 96% on nrb. he was started on cpap withimprovement in his o2 sats and in his work of breathing. givenhis relatively high blood pressures and concern of some elementof flash pulmonary edema, he was started on a ntg drip, but thendeveloped hypotension with sbp's in the 70's to 80's, whichfailed to improve with discontinuation of the ntg. therefore, hewas started on peripheral dopamine before having a femoral lineplaced at which point he was transitioned to norepinephrine forpresumed pneumosepsis and hypotension (lactate was 3.8). cxrshowed bilateral multifocal infiltrates so he receivedceftriaxone/vancomycin/azithromycin empirically. vitals prior totransfer were p 68, bp 90/34 (up from 70's off pressors), rr 22,100% on 5 of cpap.in the micu, the patient reported feeling better and was able tonod or shake his head to answer questions. still using accessorymuscles to breathe. he was asking for cpap to be removed.ros:(limited due to needing to

lowerlobebrief hospital course:76 year old male with multiple medical problems including chf,copd, and ild with very poor respiratory reserve presenting withhypoxemic respiratory failure with fever and hypotension.1) pulmonary (hypoxic respiratory failure): patient wasinitially admitted to micu where intubation was required from[2085-5-18]. multiple etiologies were considered to explain hishypoxic respiratory failure. at baseline patient hasinterstitial lung disease and copd. given fever, leukocytosis,sputum, elevated lactate multifocal pneumonia was alsoconsidered and ultimately treated with vancomycin and cefepime.unfortunately, all sputum cultures were contaminated. duringpatient's micu stay he was diuresed with iv lasix gien concernfor a possible element of volume overload as well though bnp,while elevated, was less than previous values on admission forchf exacerbation. pe was considered however thought to beunlikely given evidence for multiple other processes to explainrespiratory failure. further, patient was anticoagulated makingpe less likely. with history of copd steroid taper was startedas well as standing nebs. patient was eventually weaned to 2l ncand transferred to the floor. on the floor patient finished thecourse of antibiotics for hap, continued diuresis, and standingnebs. he continued to improve from a respiratory standpointuntil [5-31] whent he patient was found to be somnolent withdecreased respiratory drive and abg 7.30/71/146/36. patient wasthen transferred to the micu where mental status cleared andhypercarbic respiratory failure resolved. this somnolence anddiminished respiratory drive was thought to be secondary tosmall increase in the patient's gabapentin dose which he wastaking for post herpetic neuralgias. after patient returned tothe floor he was continued on a small dose of po lasix peroutpatient regimen, prednisone taper, and standing nebs. becausethe patient was deconditioned and continued to have desats themid 80s on 2l while ambulating he was discharged to rehab..2)ams: on [5-31], he was noted to be increasingly altered andconfused, pulling at his oxygen, picking at his clothing andmumbling nonsense. his abg at the time was 7.30/71/146/36. hiso2 was removed to see if his respiratory drive was depressed,but he desatted down to 70% and needed to have the oxygenreplaced. transferred to the micu as noted above. this ams wasin the setting of neurontin dosing for zoster related ear pain.he was monitored and improved in the icu with very littleintervention other than holding his neurontin.3) presumed bacterial pneumonia: the patient had increasedsputum in the context of fever, leukocytosis, and bilateralpulmonary infiltrates suggesting pneumonia. all sputum cultureswere contaminated and urine legionella was negative. givenhistory of mrsa and multifocal infiltrate patient was treatedwith vanc, cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.4) hypotension: the patient became hypotensive in the context ofreceiving nitroglycerin but remained hypotensive once thismedication was stopped. initially patient requirednorepinephrine which was quickly weaned. given concern foradrenal insufficiency stress dose steroids were initiated at50mg iv hydrocortisone q6hrs. this was weaned to pohydrocrotisone twice daily. eventually, blood pressuresstabilized and anti hypertensive agents were restarted..5) chronic systolic chf/ dilated cardiomyopathy: duringadmission patient was thought to be slightly volume overloadeddespite an elevated bnp that was lower than prior admissions.during his stay he was diuresed with iv lasix and then convertedto 20mg po lasix at the time of discharge. patient was continuedon qod digoxin and while his beta blocker and [last name (un) ] were initiallyheld these were restarted prior to discharge..6) stage iv ckd: on admission creatinine was not markedlyelevated from baseline. throughout the hospitalizationcreatinine fluctuated between 1.3 - 2 depending on the degree ofdiuresis. nephrotoxins were avoided when possible..7) af: patient is pacemaker dependent. coumadin was continuedwhile inpatient. during admission inr became supratherapeuticand coumadin was held. during this time as noted below patientdeveloped gi bleed which reguired reversal of inr and heparingtt. at discharge patient will continue coumadin per homeregimen 2.5mg daily, except tuesdays when he will take 1.5mg..8) history of dvt: continued coumadin.9) adrenal insufficiency: initially patient was hypotensive sostress dose steroids were initiated as above. once bloodpressures stabilized patient was transitioned to homehydrocortisone regimen..10) chronic anemia: patient with chronic anemia thought to berelated to chronic kidney disease. as an outpatient patientrecieves epo injections monthly. during admission patients hcttrended down in the setting of supratherapeutic inr and gi bleedas noted below. patient was transfused two units prbcs whenhct<21. hct will be followed as an outpatient and epo injectionswill be continued..11) recent herpes zoster: pt received >7 days of therapy forzoster and no active lesions. no vision changes or eyeinvolvement. patient was continued on gabapentin 300mg [hospital1 ]. postherpetic neuralgias continued to bother patient during thehospitalization, patient reported [12-6] pain, and gabapentin wasincreased to 400mg tid. the day following this change thepatient became increasingly somnolent as noted above. gabapentinat that time was stopped with improvement in mental status.scheduled tylenol was continued for pain. narcotics andneurontin were avoided given the somnolence noted above..12) hyperlipidemia: continued rosuvastatin.13) gi bleed: on [5-29], patient developed dark melenotic stool inthe setting of a supratherapeutic inr. inr was reversed with vitk 5 mg po, gi was consulted, and iv ppi 40mg [hospital1 ] was started.hct was followed and was relatively stable. gi deferredendoscopy given the patient's stability and poor respiratorystatus given concern the patient would reguire intubation forthe procedure. at discharge patient will continue omeprazole40mg [hospital1 ]. dr. [last name (stitle) ] will arrange for further gi evaluation oncepatient is optomized from a respiratory standpoint..14) non sustained ventricular tachycardia: throughout thehospitalization patient had nsvt. the longest run of nsvt was 22beats during which patient was asymptomatic. patient has biv icdin place. electrophysiology [last name (stitle) 6349] pacemaker and it was foundto be functioning normally. ep noted that the patient'spacemaker will pace patient out of this concerning rhythm ifrate exceeds 140 bpm. metoprolol was uptitrated to 25mg dailywith the hopes of decreasing the frequency of this rhythm.medications on admission:-albuterol sulfate 90 mcg 2 puffs orally q6 hours prn-digoxin 125 mcg by mouth every other day-fluticasone-salmeterol 500 mcg-50 mcg inhaled twice a day-furosemide 10 mg po daily-gabapentin 300 mg po daily-hydrocortisone 10 mg qam and 5 mg qpm daily-ipratropium-albuterol 18 mcg-103 mcg 2 puffs orally q6hr:prn-metoprolol succinate 25 mg by mouth daily-nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually as needed for chest pain x3-rosuvastatin 10 mg daily-spironolactone 25 mg by mouth once a day-tiotropium bromide 18 mcg inhaled daily-valacyclovir 1,000 mg by mouth twice a day-warfarin 2.5 mg by mouth daily on mondays-warfarin 5 mg by mouth daily on tues-sun-ascorbic acid 500 mg by mouth daily-aspirin-glucosamine 1,000 by mouth daily-multivitamin one tablet(s) by mouth daily-sennadischarge medications:1. furosemide 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. prednisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily)for 3 days: last day [6-8].3. warfarin 2.5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po mon, wed,thurs,fri, sat, sun: hold dose 6/9 and restart on [6-6]. .4. fluticasone-salmeterol 500-50 mcg/dose disk with device sig:one (1) disk with device inhalation [hospital1 ] (2 times a day).5. rosuvastatin 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).6. ascorbic acid 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).7. aspirin 81 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet, chewablepo daily (daily).8. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).9. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday) as needed for constipation.10. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid(2 times a day).11. digoxin 125 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po every otherday (every other day).12. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 ml syrup sig: 5-10 mls po q6h (every 6hours) as needed for cough.13. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 ml (0.083 %) solution fornebulization sig: one (1)  inhalation q6h (every 6 hours) asneeded for shortness of breath or wheezing.14. losartan 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).15. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) sig: two (2)capsule, delayed release(e.c.) po bid (2 times a day).16. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet podaily (daily).17. vitamin d 50,000 unit capsule sig: one (1) capsule po1x/week (we) for 8 weeks.18. hydrocortisone 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po qam (oncea day (in the morning)).19. hydrocortisone 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qpm (oncea day (in the evening)).20. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg tablet, sublingual sig: one (1)sublingual once a day as needed for chest pain: take if youdevelop cp, if cp is not alleviated call 911. .21. spiriva with handihaler 18 mcg capsule, w/inhalation devicesig: one (1)  inhalation once a day.22. warfarin 2.5 mg tablet sig: [12-29] tablet tablet po tuesdays.23. glucosamine 1,000 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once aday.24. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q 8h(every 8 hours) as needed for pain.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital3 537]- [location (un) 538]discharge diagnosis:primary:congestive heart failure[hospital 2182]hospital acquired pneumoniaanemiaatrial fibrillationsecondary:herpes zosterhyperlipidemiadischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walkeror cane).discharge instructions:dear mr.
