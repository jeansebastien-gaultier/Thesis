she had right gaze deviation, left hemianopsia, left facial palsy, left arm and leg plegia, right arm and leg paresis, and dysarthria.  she received 10 mg of hydralazine for her sbp greater than 220.  ct revealed a right basal ganglia/thalamic hemorrhage with intraventricular extension including casting of the 4th ventricle, 7 mm mls to the left, contrast extravasation suggestive of active hemorrhage but no evidence of any vascular abnormality.  she was intubated for worsening mental status and had an a-line placed for bp monitoring and management. at baseline, ms. olivo is wheelchair-bound, according to her daughter, due to her neuropathy.  she is dependent for all of her adls and has a home health aide.  pmhx: dm, htn, dementia, h/o sz d/o not on aed now, pituitary adenoma, s/p hypophysectomy, hypothyroidism, copd, dyslipidemia, obesity, fatty liver, fibromyalgia, arthritis, depression, anxiety, meningitis, rt humerus fx/osteo/nonunion, cirrhosis or unclear etiology with hyperammonemia, neuropathy with paresthesias, presumably due to diabeteshome meds: mirtazapine 15 mg daily, namenda 10 mg daily, potassium supplementation 20 meq daily, levothyroxine 100 mcg daily, metoprolol (unclear if metoprolol succinate or tartrate) 25 mg daily, prednisone 2.5 mg daily, mviall: morphine ( unknown ) codeine ( unknown ) ace inhibitor ( unknown ) lisinopril (cough ) ciprofloxacin hcl (dec effects of sz med ) atorvastatin (abnormal lft )sh: lives with her son in ardmore. has two sons and a daughter. daughter, yolanda, is the hcp (817-638-1328) and primary caregiver.  she quit smoking 16 years ago.24 hour events: admitted to nicuflowsheet data:vs: tm  hr 52-70 sr sbp 223/90 &#224;

cta was negative for a vascular anomaly. a mass lesion cannot be excluded at this time however, and will need an mri. her prognosis is somewhat difficult to articulate at this time using the conventional func  (8) and ich (2) scores given her clinical status and medical  comorbidities. plan:neuro: ich with ivh, prior h/o sz d/o not aeds now-serial neuro exams-repeat i-hct in 6 h  (at 9:45 p.m.), 24 h (6/30/97 at 3:45 p.m.), and stat with exam change-sbp goal &lt;
