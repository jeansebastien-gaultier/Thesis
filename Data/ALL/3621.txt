pain,fever/chills since [1-29]. at presentation on [1-31], there was noclear evidence of infection given that her wbc was normal andshe was afebrile. her nephrostomy pigtail was replaced andantegrade pyelogram indicated functional nephrostomy tube andpersistent distal ureteral obstruction. on cxr, the lungs wereclear. she was admitted for pain control. however, her uarevealed >100k wbcs and, on [2-1], she mounted a fever to 100.7f.she was placed on zosyn and vancomycin was added when she waspersistently febrile.  despite urine wbc count as above, urinecultures revealed only yeast 10-100k.a pain consult was requested and they recommended dilaudid pca.she was started on the dilaudid pca, but had several episodes ofhypotension while on increased narcotics for her pain requiringtransfer to the icu for monitoring.  her pca was discontinuedand her fentanyl patch was restarted.psychiatry was consulted for management of depression andaffective instability and recommendations regarding her multiplemedications including clonazepam, lorazepam, mirtazapine andnarcotics.  during her stay, she was showing signs of milddelirium with decreased attention and concentration.  thuspsychiatry recommended continuing her mirtazapine andclonazepam, but suggested limiting prn ativan and narcotics aspossible, recognizing the difficulty in this given her chronicpain.  they also suggested using seroquel for anxiety andinsomnia.in the setting of increased pain medication, specificallynarcotics, she became hypotensive to 70s systolic.  she wasmildly lightheaded at this time.  she was transferred to the icuwhere she received iv fluids to which her bp responded withsystolics returning to the low 100s mmhg.  her hypotension wasthought more likely [2-8] to her pain medication regimen and poorpo rather than hypotension [2-8] to sepsis.during her stay, multiple family meetings including her pastorwere had to evaluate code status.  she had previously been inthe care of hospice prior to this admission.  during her stay inthe setting of hypotension, code status was readdressed and shedecided that she no longer wished dnr/dni, but wanted full code. while in the icu, this was again readdressed with her family,pastor, and patient, and code status was changed to cmo.  sherequested transfer back to her home hospice care.medications on admission:fentanyl 150 mcg/hr patchlorazepam
