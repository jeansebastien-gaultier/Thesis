07-15-92discharge date :            08-23-92principal diagnosis :intracerebral hemorrhage .associated diagnosis :status post resection of a cerebellar medulloblastoma .history of present illness :the patient was a 50 year old , right handed , white male with a history of resection of left cerebellar medulloblastoma , resected six years ago and status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy , with a six month history of 30 pound weight loss , who was admitted to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center with a left basilar ganglion hemorrhage .at baseline , he had lived with his guardians , pandeprob , he was " slow " , walked with a very ataxic gait , did not talk much and spends most of his time watching tv and smoking .he had had several months of increased difficulty swallowing and slurred speech .a recent head computerized tomography scan in 01/92 was negative .he had been evaluated by his local medical doctor for his weight loss .he was transferred to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center after being found in the bathroom , on the floor at 8 a.m. , unresponsive .past medical history :cerebellar brain carcinoma , status post surgery , chemotherapy and radiation therapy six to seven years ago .he had not had any recurrence .he had history of alcohol abuse in the past .there was no cardiac disease , hypertension or diabetes mellitus .allergies :he had no known drug allergies .medications on admission :none .physical examination :a generally cachectic white male , resting quietly with his eyes closed .his blood pressure was 140/70 , heart rate 75 .the general medical examination was noted for bilateral temporal wasting .his oropharynx was clear .his skin was clear .the neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .the lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation .the heart exam revealed a normal sl and s2 , regular rate and rhythm , no murmur , rub or gallop .the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly .extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .pulses were 2+ throughout .the rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .he did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .his pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.the discs were flat .there was no retinopathy .he responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .he had a gag and good palpate movement .the tongue was midline .there was a right facial droop which was mild .he had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .he lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .his deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .he had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .laboratory data :an erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .the head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .there was mass effect and some midline shift .there was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .hospital course :the patient was admitted to then neurologic intensive care unit .on admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .his blood pressure was not elevated .the aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and b12 .once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .an magnetic resonance imaging study on 07/17/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .the medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .there was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .this was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .a repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest i minus on 7/27/92 did not show the mass initially noted .a cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .a testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and g-tube was performed at the same time .there was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .the gi service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .this confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on t2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .the urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .initially , the patient remained drowsy until decadron was added to his medical regimen .he awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .he has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .he was started on dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .this seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .his decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :he still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .he needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .he sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .he followed all commands readily .his pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .there was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .he had limited vertical up gaze .he still had a significant right central facial droop .his gag was intact with palatal movements .on repetitive testing with speech therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .he squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .he had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .his left side was full .he had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .his deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .he had an upgoing toe .on the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .he had right clonus , which was sustained .a head computerized tomography scan was repeated on 08/08/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .at that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .it was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .thus , he should return to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .disposition / plan on discharge :the patient will be discharged to limestrict t pio medical center and will be followed by dr. mo muell in one month in the neurologic clinic .medications on discharge :multivits , 1 q.d. ; dilantin , 300 mg. per g-tube qhs ; lotromin cream , 1% t.i.d. ; nystatin powder to groin t.i.d. ; mylanta , 30 boluses , 200 c.c. per g-tube q6h ; heparin , 500 c.c. subcutaneous b.i.d. ; nystatin , 5 c.c. swish and swallow q.i.d. ; full strength jevity , 65 c.c. per hour .            raba kote ,
