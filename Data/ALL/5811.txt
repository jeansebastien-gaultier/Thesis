t4 was low at3.9, c/w primary hypothyroidism; pt was started on synthroid112mcg/day. [last name (un) ] stim test was negative. endocrine was consultedand did not feel many of his symptoms were secondary tohypothyroidism. they wanted to decrease his synthroid to 50 mcg,recheck his tsh in 1 week and then decrease again to 25 mcg.this should be done at rehab.2. bradycardia: thought likely [2-19] hypothyroidism, maintained onon tele, had episodes of brady down to 35s occassionally withlongest pause 2.2 seconds. cardiology evaluated while thepatient was in the micu, said that the patient did not requirepacer but to continue to monitor for drops in pressure orsymptoms, which patient did not have during his hospital stay;thought likely to resolve as synthroid takes effect. will needoutpatient follow up..3. hypotherm: also likely [2-19] hypothyroidism, will warm asneeded for now. did not improve with synthroid. on discharge hastemp of 92.7, so there  is likely a central cause for this ofunknown etiology. the patient should be followed closely, if histemp drops farther, he should be rewarmed.4. pancytopenia: patient was noted on admission to have wbc 1.9down from baseline 6.0, hct 26.2 down from baseline 30, plts 21down from baseline 90-100. patient currently receiving epogen?5000 or 20,000 units/week, received at the va, but not followedby a hematologist. has had fairly stable counts until [2174].  in[11-19] anemia began, and was thought to be [2-19] kidney disease.egd and cspy in [5-21] were negative for bleed, iron studies werec/w anemia of chronic disease with low retic count 1.7%. hemerecommended increasing his epo to 40,000 units per week, whichwas initiated while he was in house on the night prior to hisdischarge. heme also noted that his peripheral smear containedstrange-looking cells suspicious for myelodysplastic process.they do not feel that a bm biopsy would change his management,but plan to follow him in clinic. of note, the patient's wbccount returned to the patient's normal range, his hct remainedstable after receiving 2 units prbcs. his plt count remains lowbut is slowly trending upwards. he has had no evid of bleedingbut we are holding asa given this significant risk (he has a h/ofalls).5. blood sugars: pt has h/o dm2, was started on riss asglyburide was held, then patient became hyponatremic, possiblybecause of hypothyroidism; was on a d5w drip briefly, rissadjusted to keep sugars in check; pt seems very sensative toinsulin at bedtime when he is not eating, so this scale wasdecreased compared to his daytime dosing. if patient needs to bestarted on a oral hypoglycemic, he should not be restarted onhis glyburide as it is renally cleared. glipizide can beconsidered..6. arf: pt's creatinine bumped to 4.1 from 3.5 on day prior todischarge; likely prerenal in setting of overdiuresis, netnegative 1700 day prior. rehydrated gently with 500cc, recheckedbun and cr afterwards with resolution. baseline cr 3.5..7. constipation: possibly [2-19] hypothyroid, increased bowelregimen.8. cad: ces flat, asa held [2-19] low platelets; cont statin;holding bb [2-19] avb, bradycardia. he should not be restarted on abeta blocker..9. chf: patient was initially felt to be a bit overloaded [2-19]his cxr and his clinical presentation; this was thought to bedue to a combination of bradycardia, anemia and possibleinfection; tte showed lvh but no evid of worsening heartfunction with lvef>55%. pt was initially diuresed with lasix40mg iv as needed, then became overdry with bump in creatinine,was given some fluid back via ns boluses, and is beingdischarged euvolemic..10. ?lll pna: thought to have evid of pna (?aspiration) oninitial cxr, started levaquin x 7days ( started on [1-6] to stop[1-12]). needs 1 more day..11. htn: continued prazosin, increased to 2 mg prasozin atnight, also increased hydralazine.  we avoided acei givenarf/cri, and avoided bb given profound bradycardia..12. code: dnr/dni13. communication: son [name (ni) ] [name (ni) 18965]medications on admission:asa 325 qdprotonix 40 qdlipitor 10 qdglyburide 2.5 qamiso mono 30 qdzoloft 50 qdmomepogen ?20,000/week vs 5000/weekprazosin 1mg qddischarge medications:1. alprazolam 0.25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qhs (once aday (at bedtime)) as needed.2. multivitamin     capsule sig: one (1) cap po daily (daily).3. simvastatin 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).4. isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg tablet sustained release 24hrsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24hr po daily (daily).5. prazosin hcl 1 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po qhs (once aday (at bedtime)).6. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 ml suspension sig: thirty (30)ml po qhs (once a day (at bedtime)) as needed.7. protonix 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: one (1)tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po once a day.8. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1) treatmentinhalation q8h (every 8 hours) as needed.9. epoetin alfa 10,000 unit/ml solution sig: 10,000 unitsinjection qmowefr (monday -wednesday-friday): per hemerecommendation patient should stay on this dose rather thanreturn to his 5000 unit/week prior regimen.10. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) treatmentinhalation q6h (every 6 hours) as needed.11. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid(2 times a day): especially important while on iron;
