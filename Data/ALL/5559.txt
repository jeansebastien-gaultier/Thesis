he completed a 10-day course of ivvancomycin and remained afebrile- sputum culture grew non-pseudomonas gram negative rods (cxrnormal); completed course of levofloxacin- ceftriaxone was added for 3 days ([date range (1) 18881]) due to concernfor meningitis with his second change in mental status (seebelow) and was stopped once mental status returned to baselineand it became clear there was no meningitis.# mental status change:-on the night of [9-3], the patient became acutely psychotic andagitated.  he was very worried that people were smoking crack inthe halls and that there were people trying to hurt the nursesand sabotage dr[name (ni) 6168] practice.   his warfarin and steroidswere stopped at this time. a psych consult was obtained the nextmorning who recommended haldol/cogentin.  he required sedationwith haldol/ativan/dilaudid to get a head ct (which was negativefor a bleed).  following sedation, the next evening, he wasnoted to be very rigid and received an additional dose ofcogentin.  a neuro consult was obtained the next day whorecommended stopping haldol due to the rigidity.  per neuroconsult, an lp was attempted twice to rule out cns infection,but the patient was too agitated; he was treated empiricallywith vanco/ceftriaxone until it was clear that there was nomeningitis; he had a persistently non-focal neuro exam with nomenigeal signs.  an eeg showed nonspecific slowing consistentwith his sedation.  infectious workup (cxrs, cultures) remainednegative and he remained afebrile.  his mental status slowlyreturned to baseline overnight on [2171-9-6], presumably as theeffects of the steorids wore off.  he was taken off of 1:1observation and remained calm and cooperative.  furtherpsychoactive meds (except for pain control meds) were held..## multiple myeloma: currently on velcade, last dose 10/6, anddexamethasone.- he was continued on his outpatient dexamethasone regimen (8mgpo bid) but this was stopped on [9-6] when he developedpsychosis; there were some indications that he might not havebeen taking this at home, and his self-limited psychosis wasthought to be secondary to the steroids.## ?di/endocrine:- during previous admission there was a reported history ofdiabetes insipidus; a water deprivation test was done duringthat admission, though endocrine did not see the patient.endocrine was consulted this time and recommended a pituitarymri which showed a lack of expected hyperintensity in theneurohypophysis.  no water deprivatino test was done, though hisddavp was stopped when he became psychotic and his sodiumremained normal with normal urine output.  per endo, he does notneed to be on ddavp.  also noted were low tsh, t4, t3, ft4levels.  a rt3 was slightly high and endocrine recommendedrepeat thyroid functino tests in [12-26] weeks (suspect sickeuthyroid) for follow-up with no thyroid replacement at thistime..## obstructive/restrictive lung disease: unclear etiology. mrichest showed no pe and pa hypertension- continued advair- weaned off of o2 as tolerated.## paf: currently rate-controlled.- cont metoprolol and short-acting diltiazem for rate control- warfarin was stopped due to mental status changes; with hiscontinued gait instability, it was deemed too unsafe for him tocontinue warfarin, especially since he was not in afib at allduring the admisison.## endocrine- dexamethasone as above- tsh, t4, ft4 all low; ?sick euthyroid.## hypertension:- continued on his metoprolol and diltiazem.## fen: poor po intake x weeks per sister; npo in micu- 500cc ns bolus then ns at 125cc/hr; check fluid status closely- daily lytes; watch for rising sodium- dysphagia diet, thickened liquids; may need speech/swalloweval.## code status: with his psychosis, he was made dnr/dni by hissister (due to his advanced myeloma) when he did not havecapacity to make medical decisions.## communication: sister [name (ni) 18882] [name (ni) 634] ([telephone/fax (1) 18883].## dispo: pt is deconditioned and unsteady on his feet and, perprimary team and pt, needs rehabmedications on admission:atorvastatin 20 mg qddiltiazem sr 240 mg capsule qdoxycontin 20 mg q12hddavp [hospital1 ]dexamethasone 8 mg [hospital1 ]metoprolol 100mg tidwarfarin 2.5mg qdadvair 250-50mcg [hospital1 ]oxycodone prnalbuterol mdi prnatrovent mdi prnsenna prndischarge medications:1. albuterol 90 mcg/actuation aerosol sig: 1-2 puffs inhalationevery 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.2. ipratropium bromide 17 mcg/actuation aerosol sig: two (2)puff inhalation q4h (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness ofbreath or wheezing.3. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day).4. oxycodone 20 mg tablet sustained release 12hr sig: one (1)tablet sustained release 12hr po q12h (every 12 hours): givewith 10mg tablet for total dose of 30mg q12h.5. oxycodone 10 mg tablet sustained release 12hr sig: one (1)tablet sustained release 12hr po twice a day: give with 20mgtablet for total dose of 30mg q12h.6. toprol xl 100 mg tablet sustained release 24hr sig: three (3)tablet sustained release 24hr po once a day.7. fentanyl 50 mcg/hr patch 72hr sig: one (1) patch 72hrtransdermal q72h (every 72 hours).8. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday) as needed for constipation.9. diltiazem hcl 30 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qid (4times a day): hold for hr<55, sbp<100.10. oxycodone 5 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po every 4-6 hours asneeded for pain.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital1 ] senior livingdischarge diagnosis:primary diagnosis: change in mental status, multiple myeloma,steroid psychosissecondary diagnosis: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,hypertension, osteoarthritis s/p bilateral knee replacements,restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseasedischarge condition:stabledischarge instructions:you were admitted to the hospital after an acute change in yourmental status which required intubation in order to protect yourairway.  after you were extubated, you were sent from theintensive care unit to the floor.  while on the floor, you againhad an abrupt change in your mental status where you werehallucinating and feeling very paranoid;
