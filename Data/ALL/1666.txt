details: bypass time was 211 minutes.cross-clamp time of 152 minutes. two atrial wires and oneventricular wire were placed. one pericardial blake drain wasplaced. one retrosternal blake drain was placed and one rightpleural tube blake drain was placed. for full operative details ,please refer to the operative note.immediately after transferring the patient to an icu bed from theor table , the patient went into a vfib arrest. cpcr was brieflyperformed until we could charge the external defibrillator. asingle shot of 125 joules lidocaine 60 mg resulted in sinusrhythm and stabilization of hemodynamics. the patient wastransferred to the icu for further postoperative care.icu course by system:1. neuro: the patient received sedation as required duringintubation. after extubation , the patient was weaned off allsedating medications and is neurologically intact upon transferfrom the unit.2. cardiovascular: the patient was externally paced initiallypostoperatively with external pacing wires and then wastransferred back to internal pacing with previously placeddevice. the patient was noted to be hypotensive on postoperativeday #1 and a levophed/epinephrine drip was initiated andtitrated for appropriate blood pressures. the patient was weanedoff pressors as tolerated and by postoperative day #3 was notrequiring any iv pharmacologic intervention with her blood pressure.the patient was placed on lopressor perioperatively and alsoreceived iv amiodarone for previous arrhythmia. upon transfer ,patient is internally rate controlled with a rate of 90 beats perminute and stable on a dose of lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.i.d. aswell as amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.3. respiratory: the patient was weaned to extubation onpostoperative day #1 without complication. the patient iscurrently stable on 2 liters nasal cannula upon transfer from theunit.4. the patient received perioperative iv fluids for bloodpressure maintenance. these have been weaned to off bypostoperative day #3. the patient received electrolytereplacement as indicated. the patient has begun on diuresis of40 mg lasix p.o. b.i.d. upon transfer from the unit. of note ,creatinine is 1.3 upon discharge from the icu which is equal tothe patient's baseline creatinine.5. gi: the patient's diet is advanced as tolerated afterextubation and was begun on nexium 40 mg p.o. daily.6. hematologic: the patient received blood transfusions asindicated , which included 1 unit packed red blood cells onpostoperative day #1 for a hematocrit of 25 as well as 3 units ofpacked blood cells on postoperative day #2.
