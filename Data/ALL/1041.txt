0666729cc: consult for radial artery harvesthpi:  74 rhd m with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type ii dm, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the vascular surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia. on 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by dr. godfrey.  this was complicated by a postoperative mi. 03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and cabg was planned.  of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.   he was evaluated by sonosite by the cardiac surgical pa, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.  we are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest. pmh:  cad-remote, silent myocardial infarction

       preop per cardiac surgery service-          patient to be seen by dr. queen olivares, plastic surgery fellow.  she will not be available for radial artery harvest on thursday of next

note on 3/22/81: ros: denies ha, visual changedenies cp, sob, palpitationsdenies n/v, gi upsetdenies h/o seizurescurrently has lle wound (from recent procedure)states is r. handed, likes to golf, states hands are always cold and sometimes turn "blue"-no pain associatd w/ symptomsdenies new onset of ue/le weakness plan:allen's test on rue is abnormal and is consistent with a dominant radial artery, however, left appears to be fine.will likely attempt harvest of lue radial artery-will retest allen's test intraop as welllplease avoid any additional needle sticks or blood draws from the lueplease let the plastic team know asap of the surgery date so that our schedule can be coordinated with the cabg surgery
