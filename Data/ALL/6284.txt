cad/ischemia:  status post stemi and rca stent in [2127],anterior stemi [2137-2-21] with 2 overlapping bms to proximal lad,anterior stemi [2137-3-1] with stent thrombosis.  patient presentedwith anterior stemi with st elevations v1-v4 and st depressionsin ii iii and avf.  by cardiac angiography he was found to havecompletely occluded proximal lad, 80% occlusion of the lcx andcomplete proximal occlusion of the rca with distal flow fromcollaterals. the lad lesion was opened by angioplasty and a baremetal stent was placed.  during the procedure the patient becamehypotensive with episodes of v tach and v fib requiring multiplecardioversions.  after emesis he was intubated for airwayprotection. he was then transfered to the ccu and started on[month/day/year ], plavix, and heparin. on [2137-3-1] pt developed chest painwhile at rest and was found to have anterior st elevations inv1-v3. he was treated with nitroglycerin, o2, and morphine whichresulted in alleviation of his symptoms. at cardiaccatheterization he was found to have an lad stent thrombosisthat was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improvedflow through the lad stent.  he remains on toprol xl 25mg daily,[last name (lf) 17339], [first name3 (lf) ], and plavix daily..# pump: at presentation the patient developed cardiogenic shockand was found to have a pcwp of 40 with vef 20% by echo with 3+mr, and septal and anterolateral ventricular akenesis.  an iabpwas not used becasue the patient has a tortutous aorta.  he wasinitially started on dopamine. in the first 24 hours post cathhe developed several episodes of sinus bradycardia andhypotension when attempting to wean down the dopamine thatrequired atropine boluses on one occasion. he was transitionedto levophed on [2-23]. metoprolol was started on [2-24]. aftermaintaining pressure well he taken off levophed on [2-26]. on [3-1]he developed dyspnea and appeared fluid overloaded on clinicalexam and has begun on lasix for diuresis.  on the day ofdischarge the lasix dose was increased to 80mg daily.  this canbe titrated based on fluid status and blood pressure parameters. ace-i/arbs was held due to concerns for renal function; ifrenal function recovers to baseline, we would stronglyrecommended ace inhibitor therapy for decreased ef. will need tohave creatinine and potassium checked in 2 days at rehabfacility. needs strict intake/output measurement along withdaily weights..# rhythm: during cardiac catherization patient had ventriculartachycardia and ventricular fibrillation that required multiplecardioversions to regain perfusing rhythm. at that time he wasthen started on amiodarone drip.  he was transfered to the ccuin nsr and the amiodarone was discontinued.  on [2-23] and thenagain on [2-24] he developed atrial fibrillation with rapidventricular repsonse in the context of attempted ventilatorweens.  both episodes were treated with amiodarone andmetoprolol and he returned to nsr. since [2-24] he has been in nsron daily metropolol and amiodarone.  he is also on coumadin.coumadin dose was held on [3-25] for supratherapeutic inr.plan is to restart coumadin on [3-6], inr on [3-5] at the time ofdischarge was 3.1, was receiving a dose of 5mg, patient wasbeing loaded on amiodarone. the dose of amiodarone will bedecreased and it is reasonable to initiate warfarin at 5mg andcheck frequent inr level to ensure he is not supratherapeuticand adjust as necessary..# respiratory: during cardiac arrest the patient vomitted andwas intubated for airway protection.  he was removed frommechanical ventilation on [2-25]. since, he has used up to 3l o2by nasal canula after patient reported subjective dyspnea thoughhe has maintained 02 saturations above 95%.  after ecoli wasfound in a sputum culture he completed a course ofciprofloxacin. he has had episodes of dyspnea with elvated jvpand lower extremity edema, and signs of chf on cxr;  diuresiswith lasix was begun on [3-1].  the dose was uptitrated from 40mgpo lasix to 80mg po lasix based on increased pulmonary edema oncxr.  vq scan was low probability for pulmonary embolism on[3-4].# ckd: cr 1.4-1.8 at baseline. during initial cardiaccatheterization he received  600cc dye load and  had episodes ofhypotension. he arrived to the ccu with a non ag acidosis ofunclear etiology that resolved over the next several days. hiscr peaked on [2-23] at 4.4 and then declined steadily declined to2.4 on [3-4] despite receiving another 60cc dye load on [3-1].  henever required hd, although renal consult team followed closely.he will need renal follow up as an outpatient.# dvt: despite therapeutic heparin levels, patient developed aright sided femoral to popliteal dvt discovered on ultrasound on[2-28]. as mentioned above vq scan was negative. he was maintainedon heparin and then transitioned to coumadin. because of dvtdespite heparin for acs on presentation and antiplatelet therapyperi-mi as well as in-stent thrombosis on adequate antiplatelettherapy, concern for hypercoagulable state is high and pt shouldhave full hypercoagulable work up once other issues are stable..# r arm cellulitis: in addition he developed an infiltratedright forearm venous access site that became ecchymotic andtender and was presumptive treated with cefelaxin for concern ofa possible cellulitis..# bph: restarted on flomax on day of
