service for biopsy ofpharyngeal mass, g-tube and port placement.  then transferred tothe oncology service on [8-8] for initiation of chemotherapy.  hishospital course was significant for initiation of tube feedsafter failing a swallow evaluation.  chemotherapy withdocetaxel, cisplatin, 5fu was initiated [2108-8-11], complicated bydiarrhea, severe cytopenias, ? leaking g tube, severenausea/vomiting.  on [2108-8-19], he received 10mg olanzapine fornausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developedfever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimatelytransfered to the icu [2108-8-20] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.his icu course was significant for diagnosis of lll pneumonia,hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [3-8] limited pointake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure,hypernatremia.  he has had frequent atrial ectopy and pvcs andelectrolyte abnormalities.  ent planned for tracheostomy [2108-8-28]for airway protection during therapy, but on [2108-8-28] early

however, this was complicated bybleeding over one week.  anticoagulation was stopped as aresult.  a rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second timedue to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.  he hassubsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylacticheparin 5,000 units sc tid.  on [2108-9-24] he coughed out histracheostomy cannula.  replacement was complicated by bleedingand hemoptysis requiring ent evaluation.  bleeding/hemoptysisresolved gradually over next 4 days.  he again developedaspiration pneumonia [2108-9-28] and was started on cefepime andvancomycin.  his respiratory status was stable and actuallyimproved rather quickly.  antibiotics were stopped [2108-10-3].combination xrt and cetuximab was planned.  a loading dose(400mg/m2) of cetuximab was given

placement was uncomplicated.  onadmission, he was breathing comfortably and in no distress.post-op cxr was performed, which showed pneumomediastinum; thiswas not unexpected given recent open procedure.  repeat cxrshowed no change in pneumomediastinum.  post-op trach care wasadministered including airway suctioning as needed.  tube feedswere re-initiated with additional boluses of free water givenhypernatremia.  enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of micucourse because of bleeding from suction.  however, bleeding waslimited, so enoxaparin was restarted in the morning of micu

instructions:you were admitted to the hospital for a biopsy of a tumor inyour throat (hypopharynx).  a g-tube for tube feeding and a portfor chemotherapy were placed.  the tumor biopsy confirmedsquamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to theoncology floor to start chemotherapy.  mri of the brain did notshow any cancer in the brain.  video swallow evaluation showedsevere aspiration of food and liquids.  you cannot eat or drinkuntil this is re-evaluated.  all of your nutrition must comethrough tube feeds.  tube feeds were started and you developedhigh blood sugars managed with insulin..chemotherapy was difficult to tolerate.  you needed severaldifferent types of anti-nausea medications.  all of your bloodcounts became very low from the chemotherapy.  you developedfevers and pneumonia that were treated in the intensive careunit with iv antibiotics.  you also developed a stroke withleft-sided weakness.  the stroke likely originated from a bloodclot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream andpassed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) andthen into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.you were started on a blood thinner for this.  to preventdifficulty breathing from future radiation therapy, atracheostomy was placed.  however, this was complicated bybleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.you also developed a rash on your left forehead.  cultureconfirmed this was shingles.  you were treated with ananti-viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for
