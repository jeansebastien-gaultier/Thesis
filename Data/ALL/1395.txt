of post-pyloric feeding tubein the fourth portion of the duodenum..abdominal ultrasound [2140-7-29]:impression:1.  patent tips with slightly increased velocities.2.  new 4 cm echogenic wedge-shaped structure in the right lobe. given its development since examinations of 9 and 11 days ago,it is unlikely to be a mass, however, mri can be performed on anonemergent basis for further characterization.3.  slight increase in ascites..portable cxr [2140-7-31]:there has been interval extubation and removal of right-sidedvascularcatheter and sheath.  right picc line has been placed,terminating in theproximal superior vena cava.  cardiac silhouette is upper limitsof normal in size allowing for low lung volumes.  previouslypresent mild pulmonary edema has resolved.  there is improvedaeration in the left retrocardiac region with residual patchyopacity containing several air bronchograms.  although possiblydue to resolving atelectasis and dependent edema, infectiouspneumonia is also possible in the appropriate setting.  minorright basilar atelectasis is noted as well as a possible smallright pleural effusion..renal u/s [2140-7-31]:findings:  the right kidney measures 12.2 cm and the left 11.2cm.  the renal parenchymal thickness and echogenicity arenormal.  there is no evidence of hydronephrosis or calculi.small amount of ascites is

to second part of the duodenum.brief hospital course:# alcoholic cirrhosis/acute alcoholic hepatitis: admitted to[hospital3 ] from outside hospital after recent variceal bleeds/p variceal banding. here, repeat egd was performed whichshowed previously banded esophageal varices and gastric variceswith stigmata of recent bleeding. no new bands placed.subsequently underwent uncomplicated tips on [2140-7-16]. completed 5day course of octreotide and 7 day course of levofloxacin forsbp prophylaxis. unfortunately, patient continued todecompensate, with rising bilirubin and inr. she was treatedwith lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy. ultrasound [7-18]and [7-20] both showed patent tips..given rising bili/inr, she was given a trial of pentoxyfillineand ursodiol for suspected acute alcoholic hepatitis.corticosteroids not given because of recent bleeding. however,her synthetic function did not improve, and her creatininesubsequently rose from 0.6 to 3.0. a diagnostic paracentesis wasperformed (on [7-29]), which demonstrated no evidence of sbp. herpentoxyfilline and ursodiol were discontinued as there was noclear improvement on treatment. she was started empirically onoctreotide/midodrine for possible hepatorenal syndrome.nephrotoxic medications were held and she was given volumerepletion both with normal saline and albumin. creatininesubsequently improved to 1.2-1.4 at the time of discharge..for nutritional support a post-pyloric feeding tube was placedand tube feeds were intiated per nutrition recommendations. shewill be discharged for continued nutritional support to meetcaloric goals..she was seen by social work for substance abuse support. inaddition, she was provided with information on post-dischargesupport services..meld at time of discharge was 33, driven by a bilirubin of 19.8,creatinine of 1.4, and an inr of 2.9..diuretics held given renal failure and lack of ascites onultrasound, s/p tips..# s/p upper gi bleed: initial hct was 34 which drifted down to25 then 21.9 on day of admission. she underwent egd a few hoursafter arrival, and it showed 3 esophageal variceal bands andgastric varices which had recent stigmata of bleeding but noactive bleeding. she was supported with blood products andunderwent tips as above. her hematocrit subsequently remainedstablized with no further evidence of active gi bleeding. repeategd on [2140-8-3] prior to discharge showed no significant varicesin the esophagus. there was noted granularity, friability,erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearancein the whole stomach consistent with portal gastropathy, but noactive bleeding..# acute renal insufficiency:  as outlined above, developedrising creatinine, initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome(hrs), with  uop <30 cc/hour in setting of known etoh cirrhosis. started empirically on midodrine/octreotide. however urinesodium >10, so was not completely consistent with hrs.paracentesis [7-29] demonstrated no evidence of bacterialperitonitis. urinalysis demonstrated no eosinophils. ultrasoundon [7-30] showed no hydronephrosis, but did show a new echogenicwedge shaped structure in right lobe, of unclear clinicalsignificance.  no other evidence of infarcts/ischemia werenoted, and lupus anti-coagulant was sent and was negative aswell.  renal service was consulted and nephrotoxic medicationswere held. she was repleted with iv fluids and renal functionsubsequently improved, with creatinine trending down from 3.0 to1.4, with good urine output..# hypotension: initially likely from gib, hypovolemia.subsequently remained stable in low 90's-100's systolic, insetting of chronic liver disease.  initially started on zosynand vancomycin as well as levaquin for concern for infectiousetiology, however antibiotics subsequently discontinued as noinfectious source identified. of note, blood cultures from [7-17]grew 1/4 bottles staphylococcus, coagulase negative.  this wasconsidered contaminant and repeat blood cultures were negative..# hcv: repeat hcv viral load on this admission ([2140-7-21]) showedno hcv viral rna..# dm ii: on metformin prior to hospital admission. covered asinpatient on sliding scale insulin and glargine. discharged onglargine 24units/night, and the patient demonstrated how to usessi at home. metformin and alternative oral hypoglycemicscontra-indicated in setting of her cirrhosis..# hit antibody positive: hit antibody sent due tothrombocytopenia, and was noted to be positive on thisadmission; however, she could not be anti-coagulated given herrecent variceal bleed and coagulopathy from liver disease. allheparin products were held. platelet count remained lowsecondary to liver disease, but stable, with no clear evidenceof clinical thrombosis..# nutritional deficiency: post-pyloric dobhoff placed fornutritional support to meet caloric goals. tube feeds willcontinue upon discharge with outpatient services
