y/o female without significant past medical history whopresented initially with 4 days of cough, malaise, fever at homedx with pneumonia via xray, admitted to micu for increased o2demand and acute kidney injury. ultimately intubated forrespiratory distress and found to have pneumococcal sepsis w/course c/b mods..# hypoxic respiratory failure:likely secondary to pneumonia in the setting of underlying copd,thus minimal reserve. patient had progressive increasing work ofbreathing ultimately requiring intubation. this was furthercomplicated by the development of ards in the setting of septicshock, and pulmonary edema from fluid resuscitation. herpneumonia was treated with antibiotics (see below) and shediuresis was started once she was hd stable. her respiratorystatus slowly improved. however, there was concern that due tocritical illness myopathy and resulting poor inspiratory effort,she would be at high risk of re-intubation. a tracheostomy wasperformed on [6-30]. prior
