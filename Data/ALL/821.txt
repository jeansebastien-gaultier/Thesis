and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. her ekg onadmission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats perminute and that her ekg was unchanged from her prior ekg fromseptember , 2005.hospital course by problems:1. cardiovascular pump: initially , the patient's imdur andlabetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poorrenal perfusion. however , on the hospital day #1 without ivhydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. as such ,the patient was restarted on her home imdur on february ,2005. however , her spironolactone continued to be held. inaddition , her torsemide was held. her urine output wasmonitored , revealed that she put out over 2 l on her secondhospital day. as such , the patient was started on home dose ofbeta-blocker toprol-xl 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 aswell as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. the patient'screatinine continued to improve. it was felt that the patientwas achieving good forward systolic flow and then herhypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the130s to 150s on hospital day #2. however , over the course ofhospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluidwith a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. asthe patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and chfexacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be moreaggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. as such , thepatient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continuedto gain weight and retained fluid. as such , the patient waschanged to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of lasix 2 days prior to dischargeand was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 l of netdiureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge.

artery disease. however , overnight , theevening of august , 2005 , and the morning of february ,2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , butwas restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. therewere no ekg changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,which were excessive , currently negative. she was maintained onaspirin , lipitor , imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin forthe remainder of her admission. she had no further chest painevents.3. rhythm and rate: the patient was ventricularly paced andmaintained on telemetry. she was continued on her amiodarone 200mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this withgood effect. she also continued her coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic ptat 2.8. the patient had no complications or events from herrhythm or rate standpoint.4. renal: the patient's creatinine returned to baseline byhospital day #3. it was felt that her acute and chronic renalfailure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior toadmission and subsequent hypovolemia. the patient had no furtherissues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressivehydration , taking good p.o. on november , 2005 , the patientdeveloped an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associatednausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reportedwas due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,identified by a ct of the abdomen without contrast within thepast year and by ultrasound in 2004. however , given thedislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may berelated to renal colic and as such , a ct of the abdomen stoneprotocol was obtained on november , 2005 , which showed noevidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once againgallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. the patient respondedwell to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution ofher symptoms by august , 2005 , hospital day #3.5. gastrointestinal: the known biliary colic had resolved byaugust , 2005. the patient was continued on p.r.n. codeinep.o. 30 mg q.6h. and tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. thepatient did not require iv morphine , requesting not to usenarcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospitalcourse.6. endocrine: the patient was initially started on her homedose of nph insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. andregular insulin sliding scale. the a.m. fingersticks were low ,ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.this was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospitalsetting. as such , the diabetes service after consultationrecommended decreasing her nph insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. the patient requestedminimal injections during her hospital course and at home. assuch , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as thepatient continued to express preference for twice dailyinjections. the patient achieved goal fingersticks over herhospital course and was discharged on regimen of nph insulin. inaddition , a tsh was obtained during the hospital course whichshowed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her synthroid wasincreased to 150 mcg daily. she will follow up with herendocrinologist to repeat her tsh and hemoglobin a1c.7. fluids , electrolytes , nutrition: the patient was restartedon her k-dur 40 meq q.a.m. and 20 meq q.p.m. for potassium losssecondary to diureses. her electrolytes remained stable overcourse of her
