the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .at laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .there was a class ii laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided &quot; mattox &quot; maneuvers were performed .the retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .this was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .the vein was divided and suture ligated .bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .the tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .the examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .the patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit .the patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of ringer &apos;s lactate .an intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the neurosurgery service staff during the laparotomy .intracranial pressures were normal .that day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .an arch aortogram was normal .over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring pa line guided fluid and pressors developed .the patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing svr , oliguria unresponsive to lasix / mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ards , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .he was returned to the operating room on july 4 .three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor roux-en-y drainage was feasible .four large flat jackson-pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian quinton catheter were placed .the patient &apos;s hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .however , upon transfer from the operating room table to the ricu bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .he was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the ricu .continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on july 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient &apos;s course .vancomycin , flagyl , and aztreonam were given for gram negative coccobacilli ( later identified as bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .he was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .total parenteral nutrition was started on july 5 .initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low svr , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the jackson-pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .the patient was returned to the operating room on july 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .it was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with adaptic and laparotomy pads .the abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .he was returned to the operating room on july 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .tracheostomy was also performed on july 17 .there was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .the subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .on july 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the ricu ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .on july 29 , the septic state with low svr and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .his blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on july 30 , 1993 .discharge diagnosis :severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .special procedures and operations :1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian quinton catheter ,3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,complications :severe necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .medications on discharge :n / a.doctors discharge orders :n / a.estimated disability and probable duration :n / a.disposition :mason street .risspa breath , m.d.tr :un / bmotdd :08-07-93td :08/08/93cc :
