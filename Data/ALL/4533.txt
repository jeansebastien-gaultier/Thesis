im villtro university medical center medical oncology consultation .history of present illness :the patient is a 39 year old white female , gravida i , para l , with a history of recurrent stage lb cervical carcinoma .she was originally diagnosed with cervical cancer in may of l989 .she was staged as lb and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .she underwent a radical hysterectomy .there were positive margins and positive nodes .in december of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .a ct , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .a biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .between march and may of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating cisplatin and vp-l6 with vincristine , cytoxan , and adriamycin .in june of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in july of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of cytoxan .also in july of l99l , she had right hip pain .there was a bony metastasis .orthopedic surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .on july 30 through august 4 of l99l , she received her first cycle of ifosfamide and mesna .she had prolonged neutropenia and on august 28 , she was admitted with a headache .ct scan at that time was normal .she had non-focal findings per the neurology service .on september 6 , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin , ifosfamide , and mesna .since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .she also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks .she was started on zovirax on october 3 .she presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .past medical history :as above .past surgical history :radical hysterectomy in may of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in july of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in december of l990 .past obstetrical history :spontaneous vaginal delivery times three .current medications :zovirax 200 mg five times daily ,

signs and no guarding .there were normal bowel sounds .extremities :without edema .pelvic :by dr. friednantflirt revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .there was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .laboratory examination :her electrolytes were within normal limits , her bun was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .her alt was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .her admission cbc revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .hospital course :the patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .the bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .there was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .the radiation service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the radiation service .she was also seen by the dermatology service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .she was given synalar cream and eucerin cream as a moisturizer .the patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .due to dr. friednantflirt &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the im villtro university medical center medical oncology service was consulted .they noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .however , they felt that at the venbonlea health , there were several possible options including a possible phase i trial regimen .the plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with im villtro university medical center next week .on the evening of 12/26/06 , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .disposition :discharge medications :methadone l5 mg p.o. t.i.d. ,
