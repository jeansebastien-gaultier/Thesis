                  08/15/67chief complaint:  stroke.history of present illness:  this is a 72-year-old right-handedwoman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, andhypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the neurology service on06/18/2067 with right-arm weakness and difficulty speaking.  shepresented to the emergency room 5.5 hours after last seemingnormal.  her initial ni stroke scale was 11.  she was admitted tothe neurology service for a stroke workup.  her imaging studiesshowed a left mca infarct involving the left corona radiata, headof the caudate basal ganglia, and an mi cutoff on the cta and mrain addition to a left ica occlusion.  she was taken to angiogramfor interventional neuroradiology.  she had an angiogram. radiology felt they were unable to access thecause and no intervention was attempted and the patient wasadmitted to the neuro icu for blood pressure monitoring andhypertensive therapy.  she remained stable anti-coagulated onheparin.  during the hospital stay, she spontaneously convertedto rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation, which was felt tobe the likely source of her stroke and as such was planned toremain anti-coagulated.  she was discharged to rehab andsubsequently went home from rehab on 08/04/2067.  at home, shehad been noted to have elevations in blood pressure but has beenfeeling o.k.  vna sees her once a week.  at rehab, for unclearreasons, her warfarin was discontinued and in speaking to thedischarging physician from the tracy medical clinic, this wasdone for a question of vaginal bleeding although the patient isunaware of any such problems.  she continues to get pt andoccupational therapy twice per week and complains that her memoryremains poor.  according to the family member and her daughterwho are here interpreting for her at clinic today, she continuesto have right-sided weakness, although significantly improved anddecreased verbal output although her daughter seemed to be ableto communicate well with her.  since her discharge, she has nothad any new episodes of numbness, weakness, headaches, or visualchanges.review of systems:  she denies any fevers, chills, weight loss,chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, leg cramps,claudication, dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis,heartburn, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea, vomiting,diarrhea, melena, dysuria, changes in bowel or bladder habits,rashes, arthralgias, myalgias, polyuria, polydypsia, breathing,or bleeding problems.  review of neurological systems as above.  past medical history:  hypertension, diabetes, and elevatedcholesterol.medications:  metoprolol, zoloft, zocor, and captopril.allergies:  she has no known drug allergies.social history:  the patient lives in castle rock with her son. no history of tobacco or alcohol.family history:  a sister had a stroke.physical examination:  her blood pressure was 150/80, her heartrate was 70, respiratory rate of 12.  general:  pleasant woman inno acute distress.  heent:  atraumatic, normocephalic, scleraanicteric, and oropharynx is clear.  there is no thyromegaly. neck:  supple, no bruits, with 2+ carotids.  heart:  regular rateand rhythm.  lungs:  clear to auscultation.  abdomen:  has goodbowel sounds, soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly. extremities:  no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  skin:  no rashesor ulcers.  neurological exam (conducted via her daughter and theinterpreter):  she is alert and oriented.  she is attentive.  sheis non-fluent with really minimal verbal output.  she hasdecreased naming and decreased comprehension.  she does not haveany neglect or apraxia.  registration is 3/4.  short-term memoryis 0/4 in 5 minutes.  pupils are 3 and reactive to 2 millimeters. fundi are normal.  extraocular movements are intact withnystagmus.  visual fields are full to confrontation.  she has aright facial droop.  facial sensation is intact.  hearing isnormal.  motor exam:  there is increased muscle tone on the rightarm and leg.  she has strength on the left is normal.  on theright, her strength is at least 4/5 in all muscle groups on theleft on the neck, except for about 3/5 in the distal arm.  shereports decreased pinprick and temperature on the right arm. there is no ataxia on the left.  gait is slow, walks with a cane,and so conducts the right leg.  her reflexes are brisker on theright at about 3 and she has a right plantar extensor response.  imaging data:  initial head ct on 06/18/2067 did not show anyacute stroke or hemorrhage.  on the ct, there was a question of aleft mi cutoff.  ct angiogram also showed a distal left icastenosis with minimal distal interflow.  mri of the brain showeda left mca infarction involving the left corona radiata, head ofthe caudate basal ganglia.  she has had mild to moderate chronicsmall vessel ischemic changes on her mri.  echo showed a normalef of 55% without any clot, no pfo.  impression:  this is a 73-year-old woman with significantvascular risk factors, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillationwith a left ica mca clot resulting in a left mca territoryinfarct.  on exam, she has residual aphasia involving bothcomprehension and fluency; and a moderate right hemiparesis.  itis unclear to me why the warfarin was discontinued but given herstroke and the documentation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillationduring her hospital stay, i think that she would benefit fromanti-coagulation therapy.  i have asked her to get a follow uppcp evaluation at the och to determine if indeed there areany contraindications to anti-coagulation.  if there are no suchcontraindications, she should restart on warfarin.  in addition,her blood pressure is still not well controlled and i would askher to increase her captopril to 12.5 mg t.i.d. and to maintain ablood pressure diary.  recommendations:1.  continue anti-hypertensive and increase captopril to 12.5 mgt.i.d.2.  blood pressure diary for next clinic appointment.3.  continue risk factor modification with the management ofblood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterol as she is doing.4.  pcp evaluation for question of bleeding problem during rehabstay and resumption of warfarin if there are no contraindicationsper the pcp.5.  continue physical therapy and occupation therapy for gaittraining and language rehab.6.  return to clinic in 6 months or sooner if there are any newproblems.more than 50% of this clinic visit was spent on patient educationand counseling.______________________________jordan namari akers, md, phddictated by: jordan namari akersescription document:7-1410500 vssten
