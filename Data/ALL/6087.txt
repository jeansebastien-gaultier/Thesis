drugsattending:[first name3 (lf) 6169]chief complaint:presenting for elective surgerymajor surgical or invasive procedure:total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomyendotracheal intubationcentral venous catheter placementarterial line placementhistory of present illness:the patient is a 60 year old female, with no significant pastmedical history, recently referred to gynecology-oncology for adiagnosis of ovarian cancer. she initially presented to [hospital ]hospital with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath.she also reported a 20-30 pound weight loss, gradual abdominaldistention and bilateral lower extremity swelling.  she wasfound to have a large right pleural effusion and underwent a 2.5l thoracentesis, with negative cytology. the patient also had aparacentesis with negative cytology at the osh. ct torso on [10-20]showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy,ascities, and ovarian masses.  ultrasound on [2107-10-21] showedbilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normaluterus. ca-125 was elevated at greater than 2500. she was thentransferred to the gyn-onc service for further management..patient underwent tah/bso, and ascites drainage.  right pelviclymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to beconsistent with lymphoma.  the right ovarian mass was found tobe benign.  multiple enlarged lymph noes were found, the largestwas over 5 cm.  intraoperatively, she received 1 l ivf and wasbolused subsequently for low uop and for post-operativehypotension.     patient was transferred to the [hospital unit name 153] for ongoingtreatment..upon arrival to the [hospital unit name 153], patient was intubated and mildlysedated, vs: bp 84/52 map 65 hr 88 o2 sat 95% on ac. centralline was placed under ultrasound guidance in the right ij.while in the icu, she was put on up to 3 pressors for herhypotension.  she went into acute renal failure (thought to befrom hypotension-related atn with a possible component of tumorlysis syndrome from steroid-induced lysis) requiring cvvh andrasburicase.  she was successfully taken off cvvh and extubated. she was diuresed aggressively for a 20l net positive fluidstatus since her icu admission.  her abdominal wound wasdraining up to 1l/day.  also while in the icu, she was noted tohave an ef of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an mi in thesetting of hypotension or if it is just "shocked" myocardium..after her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferredto 7 [hospital ward name 1826] for further management.past medical

heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with asmall 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe. there aremultiple nodes present within the mediastinum, the largest ofwhich is seen within the paraesophageal space measuring 16 mm indiameter. there are bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes whichcannot be definitely measured given lack of iv contrast. thereis marked axillary lymphadenopathy with a representative node onthe right measuring 20 x 18 mm and is seen on series 2, image 6.a representative node within the left axilla is seen on series2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm. there are multiple tinynodules seen within the breasts bilaterally, the largest on theleft hand side measuring 12 x 15 mm, seen on series 2, image 16.there are bilateral large pleural effusions. the lungs areotherwise clear. along the right thorax just below the scapula,there is a moderate amount of air within the subcutaneous andintramuscular space, probably sequelae from prior thoracentesis.the heart and great vessels are unremarkable. there is a 27 x 15mm node along the right pericardium measuring 15 x 27 mm, seenon series 2, image 36. the patient is intubated and has anasogastric tube extending with tip in the post-pyloric region.ct abdomen without iv contrast: there is a moderate amount ofascites. the liver is unremarkable. the gallbladder wall isthickened likely secondary to third spacing. the pancreas is notclearly defined but appears grossly unremarkable. the spleen isprominent, slightly displacing the stomach medially 12 x 7 cm.the adrenal glands are not well visualized secondary to anextensive amount of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extendingfrom the level of the sma inferiorly and encasing the aorta andivc. a representative size of this conglomeration is seen onseries 2, image 74 measuring 86 x 52 mm. there is extensivelymphadenopathy within the mesentery with a conglomerate ofnodes measuring 57 x 40 mm, seen on series 2, image 85. there isa moderate amount of ascites. the small and large bowel areunremarkable and opacified with oral contrast extending to therectum. there is no evidence of obstruction.ct pelvis with iv contrast: the urinary bladder is catheterized.the rectum is unremarkable. the uterus is not well visualized.there are no adnexal masses with the exception of extensivelymphadenopathy that extends into the deep pelvis bilaterallyinferiorly from the above-mentioned retroperitoneallymphadenopathy along the iliac nodal chains. the largest bulkof this lymphadenopathy measures 94 x 47 mm along the left iliacnodal chain seen on series 2, image 105. there is extensiveinguinal lymphadenopathy, the largest nodal conglomerate seen onthe left measuring 49 x 62 mm.also noted within the subcutaneous tissue in the midline of theabdomen are a few pockets of air seen along a linear soft tissuedefect likely secondary to prior surgical intervention.bone windows: no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions..echo ([2107-11-2]):the left atrium is normal in size. left ventricular wallthicknesses andcavity size are normal. there is severe regional leftventricular systolicdysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of theventricle. basalsegments contract well. the apex is milldy aneurysmal andakinetic, but nomasses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though theapex istrabeculated. right ventricular chamber size is normal. there isfocalakinesis of the apical half of the rv free wall. the aorticvalve leafletsappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and noaorticregurgitation. the mitral valve appears structurally normal withtrivialmitral regurgitation. there is no mitral valve prolapse. thereis moderatepulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is atrivial/physiologicpericardial effusion.repeat echo prior to r-chop ([12-5]): the left atrium is normal insize. left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size arenormal. there is severe regional left ventricular systolicdysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of theventricle. basal segments contract well. the apex is milldyaneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen inthe left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated. rightventricular chamber size is normal. there is focal akinesis ofthe apical half of the rv free wall. the aortic valve leafletsappear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and noaortic regurgitation. the mitral valve appears structurallynormal with trivial mitral regurgitation. there is no mitralvalve prolapse. there is moderate pulmonary artery systolichypertension. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardialeffusion.abdominal ultrasound ([11-24]): there are again identifiedbilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged. there is amoderate-to-large amount of ascites present in all fourquadrants, best appreciated in the left lower quadrant. in theleft lobe of the liver there are two uniformly hyperechoiclesions, the largest of which measures 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm withappearance consistent with hemangiomas. no other focalabnormalities are demonstrated within the liver. the gallbladderis collapsed with likely wall thickening again, which could besecondary to third spacing of fluid. a shadowing gallstone isdemonstrated within the gallbladder lumen. the spleen is stablein size measuring 11 cm in its longest length. a small roughly 1cm anechoic lesion, without blood flow is demonstrated withinthe spleen, not fully characterized on this study, thoughpossibly a cyst. the previously described extensive mesentericor retroperitoneal adenopathy is not well assessed on thisstudy.color flow and doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature wasperformed given history of ascites. the hepatic veins, hepaticarteries main portal vein and its branches are patent withappropriate direction of flow and normal waveforms. the inferiorvena cava is generally narrowed without intraluminal fillingdefects. this appearance could be secondary to fluid status orsecondary to ascites..cta ([12-2]): 1. there is a large right pleural effusion with completepassive collapse of the right lung. there is a small leftpleural effusion.2. again seen is mediastinal and pericardial lymphadenopathy,which is not significantly changed in comparison to the priorstudy.3. a large amount of ascites.4. three hypodensities are seen within the visualized portion ofthe liver which are not completely characterized...cytology:pleural fluid: by immunohistochemical stains, the lymphocytesare a mixture of cd20 positive b-cells along with cd3 positive(b greater than t). although definite co-expression of cd5amongst b-cells could not be discerned, a subset of weak cd5expressing cells is seen amongst the brighter cd5 positivet-cells.  scattered cd10 positive lymphocytes are seen.bcl-1/cyclin d1 is expressed in a minor subset.overall, the findings indicate involvement by the patient'sknown mantle cell lymphoma.peritoneal fluid: three color gating is performed (light scattervs. cd45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. abnormal/lymphoma cellscomprise 5% of lymphoid gated events.b cells demonstrate a monoclonal lambda light chain restrictedpopulation.  they co-express pan-b cell markers cd19 along withcd5 and fmc-7.  they do not express any other characteristicantigens including cd10, cd23. a subset express cd20.t cells express mature lineage antigens.interpretationfindings are of involvement by a lambda restricted, cd5-positiveb cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immunophenotypicallyconsistent with patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.  given thesmall percentage of involved b-cells, peripheral bloodcontamination cannot be ruled out.brief hospital course:1. see hpi for micu course.2. mantle cell lymphoma:  received 300mg/m2 of cytoxan twice aday for six doses, with high-dose decadron.  the decadron wasdiscontinued after the patient developed psychotic paranoia.she developed tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, andinitially requiring cvvh.  her counts dropped in response tochemotherapy and she was neutropenic for several days.  thepatient was treated with neupogen until her counts normalized,and she remained afebrile.  her effusions (below) continued tore-accumulate after taps, and ultimately the decision was madeto treat the patient with the first round of r-chop.  shetolerated the regimen very well, and had no issues completingthe prednisone portion of the therapy.  the patient wastransfused to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above10..3. malignant effusion:  the patient originally presented withshortness of breath from a right pleural effusion and ascites.her ascites fluid was drained in the operating room, and notsent for studies.  her right pleural effusion was tapped twice,both large volume.  cytology was positive for lymphoma.  thepatient had reaccumulation of both fluid collections, which wereunintervenable while she was neutropenic.  once her countsrecovered, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis of 3liters, which demonstrated malignant cells.  the patientremained short of breath after this procedure and underwent a1.6 liter thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary.  shetolerated the procedure well with immediate symptomaticimprovement. on a post-procedure x-ray, however, her right lungremained [last name (un) 57454]-out. she underwent cta which demostrated a verylarge right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.  thepatient, however, had an improvement in her symptoms anddecrease in her oxygen requirement.  she underwent r-chop in aneffort to treat the underlying cause of her effusions.  she wasdischarged on 40 po lasix to take daily, to which she respondedwell in the hospital..4. s/p tah-bso: the patient was originally thought to haveovarian cancer, and she underwent tah-bso on [2107-11-1].  thediagnosis of lymphoma was made on an intraoperative lymph nodebiopsy.  her ovarian pathology was cystadenofibroma..5. cardiomyopathy: in the icu, her ejection fraction was foundto be 20%, which is likely ischemic in origin from "shocked"myocardium.  repeat tte, when her critical illness resolvedrevealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sidedfailure. prior to beginning treatment with r-chop, the patientagain had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of theright heart failure and 2+ mr..6.  id:  the patient had asymptomatic pyruia on [11-14], and wastreated for 7 days with zosyn for a citrobacter uti.  repeaturine culture was negative.  she remained afebrile whileneutropenic..7. chronic back pain: mri demonstrated no spinal or vertebralinvolvement of her lymphoma.  she was maintained on narcoticsfor pain control.  as her ascites reaccumulated, her painmedication requirement increased.  she was discharged on 10 mgoxycontin [hospital1 ] and 5 mg oxycodone q4 prn.  mri revealed no spinalinvolvement of her lymphoma.8. disposition: the patient will go to rehabilitation to assisther after her prolonged hospitalization and very low functionalstatus at this point.  patient had a port placed by surgery on[2107-11-17], which was functional through the hospitalization.  shewas full code.medications on admission:hnonedischarge medications:1. calcium carbonate 500 mg tablet,
