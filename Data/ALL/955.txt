got ct head and lp, both negative for blood. however, bp was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s. i see no lmr note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his bp, given some insulin and a rx for insulin, and instructed to see his pcp the next day, and discharged. friday he did see his pcp, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral dm meds instead, and told him to return to the ed b/c he still had a terrible ha, so he came back to the educare-pullman ed tonight. he was given caffeine, ibuprofen, tylenol, and compazine, reported that his ha was gone. however, a staff physician in the ed on exam noted a wide based gait. an mri was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes mri. neurology is now consulted.to comment on his gait and other sx. patient and his wife tell me that his gait is baseline, and has been as it is for years; they have noticed no change and have no complaints. he is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ed still now that his ha is gone. vs in ed tonight: bp 172/95 max, but mostly 150-160s;
