admission date :2/15/94discharge date :2/28/94history of present illness :this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993 , while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .he came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .he had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .he became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone .his headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol .the renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin .the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .no autopsy was obtained .
