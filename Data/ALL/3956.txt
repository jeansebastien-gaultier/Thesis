he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .at that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .he had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .he was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.the family was contacted and were present at his bedside .a postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .dictated by :nila s. kayschird , m.d. ew96attending :ra leickgrend , m.d. rj12 oy792/4208batch :0953index no. sizyjjshqd :05/19/95t :05/22/95
