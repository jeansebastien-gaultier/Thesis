m.d.chief complaint:this is a 64-year-old woman with a history of nonischemiccardiomyopathy who was admitted with increasing volume overload.history of present illness:ms. schmittou was doing well until approximately two weeks prior toadmission when in the setting of dietary indiscretion she noticedsome shortness of breath and weight gain. she states that shestarted to increase her demadex from 200 mg in the morning and150 mg in the afternoon to 200 mg b.i.d. without significantdiuresis. she has continued to participate in cardiac rehabwithout significant difficulty. her weight was stable at 174.she did , however , noticed worsening of intermittent dyspnea onexertion and orthopnea , although she denied pnd or pedal edema.she denied abdominal symptoms of bloating , no satiety , nausea orvomiting. she denied chest pain , discomfort , palpitations ,lightheadedness or syncope. she does have occasional chestburning. she also noted burning in her feet bilaterally whichhas previously been attributed to neuropathy. on the day ofadmission , she presented to the outpatient clinic to have anechocardiogram and repeat exercise stress test with oxygenuptake. she exercised for 4 minutes and 32 seconds achieving apeak heart of 90 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 100/64and stopping secondary to fatigue. her peak oxygen uptake wasonly 9 ml per minute despite on rer of 1.09. this is essentiallyunchanged from a prior exercise stress test one year ago.past medical history:includes nonischemic cardiomyopathy diagnosed in 1996 , with cleancoronary catheterization at that point. she has history ofhypertension , hypertriglyceridemia , and left bundle-branch blockstatus post icd and pacemaker placement. her pacer isbiventricular. she also has a history of urine bleeding. shehad a recent hysteroscopy and laparoscopy which wereunremarkable.medications on admission:included lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily , toprol 75 mg p.o. daily ,demadex 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aldactone 25 mg daily , kcl 10 meqdaily , allopurinol 100 mg daily , colchicine 0.6 mg daily andevista 60 mg daily.allergies:penicillin.physical examination:she was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , blood pressure of 104/66.her weight was 174. her jvp was at approximately 16 cm of waterwith hepatojugular reflux to the angle of the jaw. her carotidupstrokes were brisk without bruits. her lungs were clear toauscultation bilaterally. her cardiac exam was regular in rateand rhythm with normal s1 and s2 and audible s3. she has 2/6systolic murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation. herabdominal exam was benign except for liver edge that is palpableapproximately two fingerbreadths below the costal margin. herextremities were noncyanotic with no clubbing or edema. theywere lukewarm.social history:unremarkable.family history:noncontributory.laboratory data:her most recent labs had showed a sodium of 138 , a potassium 3.9 ,a bun of 67 , a creatinine of 1.9 and glucose of 123. her lftswere all normal except for mildly elevated bilirubin of 1.3. herlast lipids showed a total cholesterol of 128 with 191triglycerides and hdl of 31 and an ldl of 59. her last cbc wasunremarkable. her ekg shows an a-sensed v-paced rhythm at therate of 72 beats per minute.hospital course by systems:cardiovascular: ms. helger is a 64-year-old female withnonischemic cardiomyopathy and class ii-iii symptoms whopresented with worsening volume overload in the setting ofdietary indiscretion. given that she is already maximized on heroutpatient diuretic dose and somewhat worsening of her renalfunction , she was admitted for further diuresis with ivtorsemide. she was also admitted for the beginning of hertransplant evaluation for potential cardiac transplant. she wasinitially started on iv torsemide 200 mg b.i.d. with a goal of 1to 2 liters of diuresis per day. she was continued on digoxinand switched over from lisinopril and captopril. her medicationswere adjusted to optimize her diuresis and avoid hypotensiveepisodes. she did go for a right heart cath on thishospitalization that showed increased ra pressure of 14 and awedge pressure of 35-44 with v wave. her cardiac index wascalculated at 1.38. her svr was calculated at 1600. her mixedvenous o2 sat was between 52% and 60% when the readings wererepeated. given that she appeared quite well and lasix drip wasstarted to accelerate her diuresis. she was maintained ontailored therapy including nitrates for afterload reduction andthe up titration of her captopril. she did have impressivediuresis on lasix drip. her transplant workup at this timeincluded pfts that showed an fvc of 2.64 , which his 86% predictedan fev1 of 1.82 , which is 75% predicted and fev1 to fvc ratio of69%. her corrected dlco was 14.6 , which was 56% of predicted.she did have as well a carotid duplex ultrasound showing nosignificant stenosis in either carotid artery. her anklebrachial indices were greater than 1 in both lower extremitiesand her leg pulse volume recording was all entirely normal. her24-hour urine collection showed a value of 920 mg over the totalvolume which was in the normal range. she did continued torespond reasonable well to the diuresis with the exception of afew episodes of asymptomatic hypotension. her creatinine didbegin to bump marginally indicating that she had likely beenslightly over diuresed. she subsequently stabilized and wasdischarged on a stable dose of diuretics including torsemide 100mg p.o. b.i.d.her other discharge medications include captopril 25 mg t.i.d. ,isordil 20 mg t.i.d. , claritin , coumadin 5 mg daily , thiamine andmultivitamin , colchicine , magnesium , evista , aldactone 25 mgdaily , digoxin 0.125 mg daily and allopurinol 100 mg daily ,toprol-xl 25 mg daily.she was discharged with plan for regular follow up with heroutpatient cardiologist.escription document: 6-0881993 emssten teldictated by: tarwater , charlieattending: jecmenek , stuartdictation
