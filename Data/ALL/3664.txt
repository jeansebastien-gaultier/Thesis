poor echo windows .based on 1997 aha endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .conclusions :the left atrium is normal in size .left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal .due to suboptimal technical quality , a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded .overall systolic function is good ( lvef > 40% ).right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion .no aortic regurgitation is seen .the mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal .mild ( 1+ ) mitral regurgitation is seen .there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .there is no pericardial effusion .impression :good global biventricular systolic function .mild mitral regurgitation .the prior study of 2017-06-01 ( tape reviewed ) was of very suboptimal technical quality and not directly comparable to the current study .if more definitive information regarding ventricualr fuynction is needed , a cardiac mri ( ( 951 ) 247-0244 ) or radionuclide study is suggested .based on 1997 aha endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations , the echo findings indicate a low risk ( prophylaxis not recommended ).clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data .electronically signed by lisa john , md on 2017-06-13 18:41 .oak bluffs physician : gregory,domingo j .brief hospital course:pleural effusion : s/p pigtail cath drain .imaging indicated that the pleural effusions had resolved .thoracics agreed to no need for pigtail placement .chf :patient was seen by chf ( echo results are detailed above ) .they recommended continuing beta-blocker and titarting ace as tolerated .patient should be kept euvolemic once peripheral edema resolves ( may use lasix to decrease edema ).she will need a repeat echo in 3-6 months ( since this echo showed a question of focal wall motion abnormality ).also , patient was started on amiodarone and digoxin was held secondary to high levels ( please restart when level less than 2 )diarrhea :stool c. diff neg x1 .she will need two more specimens .copd : cont nebs .paf : started on amio , cont b-blocker , and patient was started on coumadin - levels ( inr ) should be monitored .nutrition :patient should be started on tube feeds at rehabrash :patient developed a diffuse erythematous rash , though to be an id reaction to a recent fungal infection .she has been satrted on benadryl and hydrocort for sx relief .please monitor this ( may need dermatology consult ).also a drug reaction is in the ddx but unlikely as rash started at rehab prior to receiving drugs here .medications on admission :meds at pocasset mental health center :sq heparin , mvi , nystatin , colace , albuterol , atrovent , amiodarone 400 bid , pulmicort , digoxin , metoprolol 12.5 tid , reglandischarge disposition :extended caredischarge diagnosis : tracheobronchomalecia chfpafcopddischarge condition : deconditioned but stabledischarge instructions :please call your doctor or come to robert if you develop fevers , chills , cp , nausea or vomiting , or any other concerning sxfollowup instructions :call dr. pederson office for appointment in 2-3 weeks -( 869 ) 263-1570.you will need a repeat echo within 3-6 monthsplease call your pcp for an appointment within 1 week -
