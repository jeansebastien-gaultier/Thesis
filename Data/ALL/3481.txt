blacheon 11/16/06 , urgent cardiac cathet1erization for cardiac arrestperformed by dr. monte lenig with stent placement in thecircumflex.on 4/22/06 , dual chamber icd placed by dr. dannihospital course by problem:this is a 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease andmitral valve replacement. he was initially admitted for an uppergi bleed and was then admitted to the ccu status post v-fib arrestand found to have nstemi. his course in the ccu was as follows:1. cardiovascular:a. ischemia: nstemi. the patient had a troponin elevationbeginning 15 minutes after a code was started , suggesting that the nstemioccurredand then caused v-fib arrest. the peak troponin was 111.cardiac catheterization showed severe 3-4 vessel disease ,and occlusion of the svg graft. two drug-eluting

meals.physical examination at discharge:on the day of discharge , the patient was afebrile. heart rate70-80s , blood pressure 90-120/66-70. oxygen saturation 96-98% onroom air. weight 87 kilograms.
