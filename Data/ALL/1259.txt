on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.  she also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the l foot, but there is no paresthesia.  she denies cp, sob, n/v, flank pain, or any urinary sx and has no history of cardiac disease.pmh: - diabetes type 1 since age 10- pvd- htn- hyperlipidemiapsh:- l fem-anterior tibial bypass - 5/3/78- right fem-pop bypass - 2066- left fem-dp bypass &#8211;
