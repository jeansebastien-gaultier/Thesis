or chills. she reported that her symptoms did not improveduring the day and the night prior to admission , the patient notedshortness of breath on exertion. she denied chest pain or chestpressure. she had no diaphoresis , nausea , vomiting , or lightheadedness. the patient presented to bellmarle medical centeremergency department for persistent inability to sleep. onevaluation in the emergency room , her blood pressure was 136/75with a pulse of 124 , respiratory rate of 32 , and saturations of 94%on room air. she was given nebulizers times three then 20 mg ofintravenous lasix. she put out 600 cc of urine to that lasix. theemergency department then attempted to give her verapamil 5 mgtimes three to decrease her heart rate which was not effective.the patient had no prior history of cardiac event. her lastexercise test was in 1993. she went three minutes and five secondson the treadmill and stopped secondary to shortness of breath. hermaximum heart rate was 130 with a maximum blood pressure of 190/80.she had a baseline left bundle-branch block and therefore , her ekgwere not interpretable.allergies: patient had no known drug allergies.current medications: meclizine 25 mg t.i.d. , proventil tablet 4 mgp.o. q.h.s. , oxazepam 10 mg p.o. q.8h. ,hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d. , and flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h.social history: habits included that patient did not drink alcoholand she did not smoke cigarettes. patient livedat home with her family who were very involved with her care.physical examination: patient was an elderly hispanic woman in noacute distress. vital signs included atemperature of 98.2 , blood pressure 108/59 , pulse 101 , andrespiratory rates of 30 with saturations of 92% on three liters.heent: examination revealed a jugular venous pressure at 6 cm.chest: showed bilateral rales two thirds of the way up withoutwheezes and no focal findings or egophony. cardiac: examinationshowed a regular rate and rhythm , tachycardic with a normal s1 ands2 , no murmurs , and no s3 or s4. abdomen: showed a well healedsurgical scar , breath sounds present , no hepatosplenomegaly , and nohepatojugular reflux. extremities: without edema , clubbing , orcyanosis and she had 2+ symmetrical distal pulses. neurological:examination was within normal limits.laboratory examination: sma 7 was within normal limits with a bunof 15 and a creatinine of 1.0 , cbc showeda white count of 9.45 , hematocrit of 36.5 , and platelets of 338.ck was 110 and troponin was 0.0. chest x-ray showed increasedheart size with bilateral increased interstitial markingsconsistent with pulmonary edema and positive pulmonary vascularredistribution. ekg showed normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats perminute with normal intervals , an axis of negative 16 , a leftbundle-branch block , and no significant changes since 6/21/97.hospital course: patient was admitted for new onset congestiveheart failure. she was ruled out for myocardialinfarction. on the second day of hospitalization , she underwent anexercise tolerance test mibi on which she went four minutes andeleven seconds on a modified bruce protocol. she stopped secondaryto fatigue. she denied chest pain , there were no ekg changes , andshe had several bursts of nonsustained supraventricular tachycardiawith exercise. nuclear images revealed mild fixed reduced uptakein the inferior wall consistent with a small injury but no evidenceof ongoing ischemia. an echocardiogram was also performed thatrevealed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesis and anejection fraction of 15% to 20%. she had mild mitral calcificationwith mild regurgitation , trace tricuspid regurgitation , and anormal right ventricular size and function. it was determined thatthe patient would benefit from afterload reduction and inatropygiven her poor ejection fraction. she was started on captopril ,digoxin , and isordil in addition to the lasix she had received uponpresentation for her congestive heart failure. the patienttolerated these medications well and maintained a systolic bloodpressure of approximately 100 without symptoms of orthostasis.disposition: discharge medications: proventil tablets 4 mg p.o.q.h.s. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,flexeril 10 mg p.o. q.8h. , digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q.d. , lasix 80 mgp.o. q.d. , isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , meclizine 25 mg p.o.

patient will follow-up with her primary carephysician , dr. rheaves , at sharp statepark rehab inston dr. jankoff will adjust her medications asnecessary and will arrange for an out-patient holter monitor tofollow-up with nonsustained run of supraventricular tachycardiaduring her exercise stress test.dictated by: albert w. breithaupt , m.d. en80attending: barrett delsol , m.d.
