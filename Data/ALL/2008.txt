flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .associated procedures :2/14/94 - tracheostomy .history of present illness :mrs. scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an fev1 of .93 and a dlco of 5.12 .her x-rays and ct scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .she underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the pulmonary service .she was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .past medical history :( 1 ) hysterectomy .( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .( 3 ) bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .medications on admission :prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , cytotec 10 mg q.d. , zantac 150 mg b.i.d.physical examination on admission :respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :sclerae nonicteric , perrl , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .the heart exam revealed a normal sl and s2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .chest :decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .the abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .extremities :slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .admission laboratory data :room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , bun 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest x-ray post biopsy :tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .hospital course :early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .there were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .she was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .she underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .these were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .it was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .this proceeded uneventfully .she was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .however , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .this appeared to be respiratory in origin .she was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .x-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .she was therefore transferred up to the respiratory intensive care unit .early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .she ruled out for myocardial infarction .she developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .this improved her right heart function with lower pa pressures .she developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .she remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her levophed as well as her nitric oxide .however , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .this improved her cardiac function .she failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .she had a complicated course from an infectious disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for streptococcus milleri .the right pleural fluid was also positive for streptococcus milleri .she had citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .she was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .this was discussed with the respiratory intensive care unit staff .her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.the patient &apos;s family was notified .rielleus large , m.d.tr :siw / bmotdd :02/17/94td :02/19/94
