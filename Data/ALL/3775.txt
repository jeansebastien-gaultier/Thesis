course:on [10-6] the pt presented to an osh with abdominal pain where act abdomen was done which showed an aortic dissection. she wastransferred to [hospital1 18] and had a confirmatory cta.  she wasadmitted to the icu for blood pressure control and serialabdominal exams.at the time of presentation to [hospital1 18] she was not complaining ofany abdominal pain and her vascular exam was unchanged (palpablebilateral upper and lower extremity pulses).  she was agitatedwhile in the icu and received ativan to which she becamedelerious.  she was seen by psychiatry for acute delerium andthey asked to hold ativan and to use hadol for any agitation.she remained stable and the plan was to manage her medially.she was transferred to the vicu.  on the morning of [2112-10-10] shewas complaining of upper abdominal pain and retro sternal pain.her vs were stable at that pt as was her ekg.  on exam shelooked slightly pale without diaphoresis.  her distal pulseswere all palpable at
