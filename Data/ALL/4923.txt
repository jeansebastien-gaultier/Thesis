infrarenal abdominal aortic endograftplacement. no endoleak is identified. the left limb of the graft is occluded throughout its entire extent.  there is mural thrombus identified in the proximal aspect of the graft circumferentially.	the left limb is again noted to extend into the left external iliac artery.  the distal right limb terminates in the right	common iliac artery. there is a normally patent right to left femoral femoral bypass graft. the aneurysm sac, previously measuring 55 x 51 mm, now measures 53 x 50 mm.echo 2/94: ef > 50% trace to mild mitral regurgitation. there are thin mobile echoes associated with the aortic valve leaflets most c/w lambl's excresence.  there is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral doppler.  there are atheroma in the aorta but no protruding or mobile components.the left ventricular cavity size is normal.  the left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.there is a very small circumferential pericardial effusion.  there is evidence of a large pleural effusion.egd 1/94: - savary-miller grade iii reflux esophagitis.ekg:  sinus rhythm w/ 1st degree av block. q in i, avl, and ii, ii, avf.  t wave
