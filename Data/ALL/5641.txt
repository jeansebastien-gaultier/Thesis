[2159-4-27]findings: as compared to the previous radiograph, the volume ofthe right hemithorax has decreased. as a consequence, there isincreased crowding of the right perihilar vessels. however,there

to the cardiology service anddofetilide was initiated given atrial fibrillation. on hd#1patient develope hypoxic respiratory distress reguiring transferto the ccu where he was treated for community acquired pneumoniawith vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline given concern for qtprolongatoin. during his stay in the ccu he was intermittentlyin atrial fibrillation with rvr and would intermittently developrespiratory distress reguiring bipap.  patient was eventuallytransferred to the micu for more intensive management of hispulmonary issues. there the patient completed his course ofantibiotics and was diuresed. slowly the patients breathingimproved and on [5-4] was transfered to the general medicalfloor.hypoxic respiratory distress:on presentation to the hospital patient was at baselinepulmonary status. initial cxr with question of rll opacity. onhd#1 patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure which[hospital 70655] transfer to the ccu and broad spectrum antibiotics totreat rll pneumonia visualized on cxr. further patient becamefebrile prior to transfer. initially patient was thought to haverll infiltrate c/w pneumonia and high fever. patient was treatedfor probable rll pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, anddoxycycline completing an 8 day course. on transfer to the micuthe patient appeared to have superimposed pulmonary edema fromvolume resuscitation as evidenced by los fluid balance, intervalweight, and clinical exam.  micu attempted low dose lasixovernight [4-27] for diuresis and monitored respiratory status,with 700cc out and no worsening in creatinine.  non-contrast ctshowed moderate right sided pleural effusion. based uponpatient's respiratory distress, he underwent a 1.5lthoracentesis on [4-29] with interval improvement in respiratorystatus. patient has limited reserve given prior pneumonectomyand severe kyphoscoliosis and may not tolerate small volumes offluid. a urine legionella was negative. blood cultures negative(finalized). sputum cultures contaminated. pleural fluidappeared transudative and cultures ngtd. the patient wasmaintained on nebulizers as needed. the patient underwentaggressive diuresis with iv lasix and was negativeapproximately 6 liters for his micu stay (though even fromadmission weight). the patient initially required bipap aroundthe clock.  he was weaned to a shovel mask and eventually to anasal cannula with diuresis.  he continued on bipap at nightwith his home settings. based upon radiographic images, therewas concern that patient may be aspirating.  he was evaluated byspeech and swallow who cleared the patient for solids and thinliquids; pills whole with puree. after diuresis patientcontinued to improve, no longer needing bipap during the day.patient was transferred to the general medical floor wherediuresis was continued. the patient was maintained on nasalcannula 1-2l for a week, and finally weaned down to ra, sattingmid90s on discharge. the patient was discharged on lasix andaldactone.atrial fibrillation:on admission to the hospital patient was found to be in atrialfibrillation. with therapeutic inrs for the past two months.decision was made to start dofetilide. patient initiallyconverted to sinus rhythm prior to transfer to ccu. during ccustay patient was paroxysmally in atrial fibrillation which wasintermittently controlled with diltiazem.  the patient wascontinued on dofetilide per ep recommendations, and daily ekgswere initially obtained to monitor for qt prolongation.  thepatient's diltiazem was up-titrated as tolerated.  at the timeof leaving the micu, he was on diltiazem extended release 240mgpo bid.  he was in sinus rhythm. on the floor, the patient wasintermittently in afib. he was started on metoprolol 25mg po bidfor

last day inthe micu, he was started on acetazolamide 250 mg [hospital1 ].junctional bradycardia:likely secondary to beta-blockers.  the patient was started onmetoprolol, as recommended by ep. the
