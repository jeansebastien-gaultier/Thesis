neck, superior mediastinum, throughout theintrathoracic mediastinum, bilateral hila, and to a lesserextent within the axillary regions. large right pleural effusionis dependent in location and measures simple fluid density. asmall amount of loculated fluid is also present within the majorfissure and in the anterolateral portion of the right lowerchest. extensive consolidation is present within the right lowerand right middle lobes.  peribronchiolar abnormalities arepresent in both upper lobes with a combination of ground glassand consolidation accompanied by bronchial wall thickening andsmall peribronchial nodules. a dominant peribronchial nodule inthe left upper lobe measures 2.2 cm and is surrounded by a haloof ground-glass opacity (26, series 3a). this corresponds to arapidly growing focal opacity on serial chest x-rays between[2135-2-8] and [2135-2-10]. additionalperibronchiolar abnormalities are present to a lesser extentwithin the left lower lobe.exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region,but note ismade of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy aswell asincompletely imaged splenomegaly.lucent spine lesions within the lower thoracic spine (image 53,series 3a and image 48, series 3a) are probably hemangiomas.degenerative changes are also noted at multiple levelsthroughout the spine.impression:1. multifocal lung abnormalities most suggestive of a widespreadinfectious process. nodular opacity with ground-glass halo inleft upper lobe is nonspecific, but this appearance may beassociated with angioinvasive aspergillus infection in thesetting of neutropenic fever.2. large simple right pleural effusion.3. extensive lymphadenopathy, likely related to the providedhistory of cll.  splenomegaly is also in keeping with thisdiagnosis.4. two lucent thoracic vertebral body lesions in the lowerthoracic spinewhich probably reflect hemangiomas..ttethe left atrium is normal in size. no atrial septal defect isseen by 2d or

a normal left ventricular fillingpressure (pcwp<12mmhg). right ventricular chamber size and freewall motion are normal. the aortic valve leaflets are moderatelythickened. there is no aortic valve stenosis. trace aorticregurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildlythickened. trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. there isborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is nopericardial effusion.impression: normal left ventricular cavity size and wallthickness with preserved global and regional biventricularsystolic function. no clinically significant
