posterior circulation infarction .2) aspiration pneumonia .history of present illness :the patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .he was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .on the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .the family reported one episode of vomiting at home .physical examination :the patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .general :the patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .neck was supple with full range of motion .no bruits were heard .chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .there was no pupillary defect .dolls eye was negative .there was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .corneals were present bilaterally .gag was present weakly .face was symmetrical .tongue was midline .the patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .there was only minimal movement on the left side .on sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .the left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .laboratory :laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , bun 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .ast was 20 , alt 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. ck was 113 .thyroid function tests were normal .troponin i was 0.05 .total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. white blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .pt was 12.3 , ptt 27.1. an ekg showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic t-waves in v1 to v3 without any acute changes .a chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .the head ct scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .hospital course :the patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .around 4:00 am the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .neurologically , the patient was not following commands .eyes were closed .he was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .withdrawal to pain was still present .both plantars were upgoing .a blood gas at this point showed a ph of 7.49 , po2 61 , pco2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .ekg showed sinus tachycardia .the patient 's temperature was 102 degrees .a repeat cat scan of the head was performed .this showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .there was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .at this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .an mri and mra of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .the mri showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .the mra of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .the left vertebral artery was not visualized .there was a dominant right vertebral artery .there was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .there was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .the patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .the aspiration pneumonia was treated with cefotaxime and metronidazole .the patient 's family was involved and they decided to opt for dnr / dni in view of the poor prognosis .the patient passed away at 6:45 am on june 12 , 1998 .condition on discharge :deceased .discharge orders :none .dictated by :gregsis streets , m.d. sq51attending :chlino b. sham , m.d. ni76 ln647/8356batch
