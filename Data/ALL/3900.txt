the jugular venous pressurecannot be assessed secondary to the patient's body habitus. thecardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with ans1 , an s2 , and an s3 , and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border and a 2/6 murmur at the left uppersternal border. examination of the lungs is significant for ralesbilaterally in one-third of the lung fields. she also hasinspiratory and expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratoryphase. the abdomen is soft , non-tender , and non-distended , with nomasses. the extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lowerextremities and the pulses are 2+ in the dorsalis pedis andposterior tibial arteries. on neurological examination , thepatient is alert and oriented times four. the neurologicexamination is otherwise non-focal.data base: the admission chest x-ray showed moderate congestiveheart failure with moderate pulmonary edema but noacute infiltrate. the ekg revealed a normal sinus rhythm with arate of 60 , a normal axis , and no st-t wave changes when comparedto prior ekgs from october 2000. the admission laboratory studieswere as follows. the sodium was 140 , the potassium 4.0 , thechloride 99 , the co2 39 , the bun 23 , the creatinine 0.9 , theglucose 78 , the ck 114 , the troponin 0.00. the white count was8 , 200 , the hematocrit 44 , and the platelets 315 , 000. the pt was11.8 , the ptt 23.1. the cholesterol level was 206.hospital course: by problems:1. cardiovascular. the patient was re-admitted to the wakeview hosp of valley with worsening congestive heart failure on a doseof lasix of 40 mg p.o. q.d. she received 120 mg iv lasix in theemergency department and her diuresis was continued with aggressiveintravenous lasix until two days prior to discharge , when she wasswitched to p.o. lasix. she was started initially on 120 mg of ivlasix once a day , which resulted in a diuresis of 1-2 liters everytwenty-four-hour period. the patient was ruled out for myocardialinfarction by serial enzymes and ekgs. the decision had been madeduring the last hospitalization to manage her coronary arterydisease medically. the patient did not desire cardiaccatheterization at this point. she was eventually switched to orallasix at a dose of 60 mg by mouth twice a day.2. respiratory. the patient was admitted to the hospital forcongestive heart failure but also had evidence of reactive airwaydisease on clinical examination. she had profound inspiratory andexpiratory wheezes and shortness of breath. due to the history ofreactive airway disease , the patient was started on intravenoussolu-medrol , albuterol , atrovent , and serevent. she was givensupplemental o2 to maintain her oxygen saturations greater than93%. she was continued on her iv steroids throughout thehospitalization , and these were eventually switched to p.o.prednisone near the end of the hospitalization and were to betapered on an outpatient basis. her shortness of breath resolvedby the time of discharge.3. fluids and electrolytes. due to the aggressive diuresis , thepatient developed a contraction alkalosis during the course ofhospitalization. her bicarbonate rose to a level of 43 , with a bunof 34. at this time , the diuresis was withdrawn slightly and thepatient's electrolytes normalized.discharge medications: albuterol inhaler two puffs q.i.d. ,enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. ,lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , robitussin with codeine 5 ml p.o. q.4h. ,atrovent inhaler two puffs inhaled q.i.d. , isordil 20 mg p.o.t.i.d. , lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , nitroglycerin 0.4 mgsublingually p.r.n. , zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , zocor 20 mg p.o.q.h.s. , norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. , serevent two puffs inhaled b.i.d. ,claritin 10 mg p.o. q.d. , flovent 220 micrograms inhaled b.i.d. ,cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d. , and a prednisone taper with 60 mg p.o.q.d. for three days , then 50 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 40mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 30 mg p.o. q.d. for three days ,then 20 mg p.o. q.d. for three days , then 10 mg p.o. q.d. for threedays.discharge condition: improved.disposition: the patient was discharged home.dictated by: carmen o. montalgo , m.d. ao20attending: casey m. mcgoon , m.d. fs8cm264/7085batch: 11834 index no. grkj7234j1 d: 3/13t: 6/3
