left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descendingartery , saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , saphenous veingraft to the posterior descending artery , and saphenous vein graftto the obtuse marginal artery three. in 1992 he had unstableangina , and catheterization showed that the distal grafts weretotally occluded. he had a redo coronary artery bypass graft withsaphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery and theleft circumflex , his postoperative course being complicated byatrial fibrillation. in 1996 , he had a non-q wave myocardialinfarction with a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ofthe saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one , and saphenous veingraft to the posterior descending artery. in 1997 , he had a repeatpercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with an saphenousvein graft to the diagonal one , and an saphenous vein graft to theposterior descending artery. most recently he was admitted inmarch of 1999 with an

course: in summary , this is a 73-year-old man withextensive coronary artery disease , who presents with one day of histypical anginal pain , multiple bruits , new lateral t waveinversions , admitted for a rule out myocardial infarction. hishospital course by issue:1. cardiovascular: mr. jinkerson was catheterized on the evening ofadmission , and he was found to have the following. he was found tohave a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal one was 100 percentoccluded. saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending arterywas open. his left main was 30 percent occluded. his leftanterior descending artery was 99 percent occluded. his diagonalone was 100 percent occluded. his left circumflex was 80 percentoccluded. his left subclavian which was supplying his leftinternal mammary artery

mr. maheu tolerated thisprocedure well. he had no return of his chest pain after theprocedure , and his pulses remained normal , he had no groinhematoma. he was placed on plavix. he also continued his aspirin ,and his coumadin was restarted after the heparin and intravenoustng which were originally put on board to prevent arterial spasmafter the procedure , were discontinued. his next cardiovascularissue was his blood pressure. he was originally on atenolol 25milligrams q.d. , we added back cozaar 25 milligrams q.d. which hehad been on before admission and had been stopped a month
