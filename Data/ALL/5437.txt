you for kindly referring your patient, jacob rodriquez, to theinternal medicine for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.although i'm sure you are familiar with his history, i will reviewit now for our records. dr. rodriquez is a 77-year-old retired electricianat wells fargo who by his report has enjoyed excellenthealth until the past year. he denies any prior history ofhypertension, coronary artery disease, chest pains, significantchildhood illnesses or malignancy. he describes his usual baselinehealth as excellent. he is a religious walker, walking multipletimes each week as well as a woodwind and singing enthusiast. dr.rodriquez states that in approximately april or mayof the past year hewas first diagnosed with hyperglycemia. this was treated withmetformin. subsequently hydrochlorothiazide and zestril were addedapparently for hypertension (although the patient does not believehe has been diagnosed with hypertension). he subsequently developeddiarrhea which he felt was related to glucophage which wassubsequently reduced in dose. in june of the past year the patientwas noted to be anemic which was felt to be related to sulfa in hishydrochlorothiazide. at that time he also was found to have lowerextremity edema which worsened with the discontinuation of thehydrochlorothiazide. the patient states in september of 2119 hetraveled to trinidad and tobago. while in trinidad and tobago he had amarked increase in his lower extremity edema to the point that hefound it difficult to ambulate. he denied any difficulty with chestpains or shortness of breath. he had no hemoptysis and no focalunilateral leg swelling despite the long period of immobilityduring the trip. he was seen by a trinidad physician who prescribed anethacrynic acid which reduced his lower extremity edemasignificantly. however, he subsequently developed diarrhea to thismedication and it was stopped. subsequently his lower extremity hasonce again worsened and has been treated with increasing doses oflasix and with the recent addition of zaroxolyn. at the presenttime dr. rodriquez states that he has no overt shortness of breath. hestill able to sing vigorously and to play woodwinds without any page 2freeman faust, m.d. re: jacob rodriquez, m.d. january 18, 2120limitation. he does find ambulating difficult due to the swellingin his lower extremities. he has no chest pain, has no cough, nosputum production, no hemoptysis. he has no fevers or chills. hebelieves his weight is increased by 35 pounds in the past severalmonths. he believes this is entirely due to edema accumulation. hedenies any difficulties with disrupted sleep although he does notethat he's becoming increasingly fatigued during the day and isoften napping in the reclining chair which is new for him. hedenies any history of snoring. he has noted no new joint complaintsalthough he has had a pruritic eruption on the anterior surface ofhis right lower extremity as well as on his left arm. this has beenpresent for approximately two or three months. other than that hebelieves his bowel and bladder function is normal. review ofsystems is otherwise unremarkable. his past medical history is significant for:     1. type ii diabetes as above.      2. an apparent diagnosis of labile hypertension noted in his         chart.      3. anemia thought secondary to hydrochlorothiazide.      4. past history of right bundle branch block. he has no              history of rheumatic fever. current medications include atenolol 25mg daily, folic acid,glucophage 850mg bid, lasix 120mg daily, lisinopril 15mg daily,compression stockings, metolazone 2.5mg daily was added recently. drug allergies include possible hemolytic anemia due tohydrochlorothiazide. family history is significant for diabetes mellitus. social history is assuming for the fact that the patient is animmigrant from trinidad and tobago. he has been living in haleyvillesince the early 2059's. he is a electrician at wells fargo. hehas minimal exposure to chemicals in his research towards hisbachelor's degree but none since then. he is a non tobacco user. heuses alcohol minimally. he's never had any blood transfusions. helives with his wife. they have no pets. he does not enjoy anyunusual hobbies not noted above. he has been exposed totuberculosis in the past and has a history of a positive ppd. on physical examination today dr. rodriquez weighs 193 pounds. bloodpressure is 136/90. pulse 83 and regular. respiratory rate is 20.temperature is 96.8. resting oxygen saturation is 98-99% withambulation in the hallway. this fell to a minimum of 97% with anincrease in his heart rate to 100. heent exam is significant for aclear oropharynx. sclera are white. conjunctiva are minimally pale.page 3freeman faust, m.d. re: jacob rodriquez, m.d. january 18, 2120the thyroid gland is normal. jugular venous distention toapproximately 10 cm. was noted. neck was supple. examination of thechest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with dullnessat both bases. there was no egophony and no wheezes. otherwise thelungs were clear. cardiac exam with a regular rate in rhythm,normal s1 and s2, an intermittent s4 was appreciated. no rv heaveor lift was appreciated. no pulmonary artery tap was appreciated.the pontic component of s2 was moderately enhanced. no appreciablemurmurs were detected. the point of maximum impulse was in theanterior axillary line. examination of the abdomen revealed anontender abdomen with a palpable liver edge, three fingerbreadthsbelow the right costal margin. this was nontender and smooth.minimal splenomegaly was also appreciated as well. normal bowelsounds were present. examination of the extremities reveal threeplus symmetric edema to the top of the thigh in the lowerextremities, one plus edema was also present in both upperextremities. no clubbing was noted. there were no skin changesconsistent with collagen vascular disease. multiple follicularlesions were noted on the anterior aspect of the right thigh aswell as on the left arm. neurological exam was grossly nonfocal. objective data include a cbc which most recently demonstrated awhite count of 11.8, hematocrit of 32.1, platelet count of 250.differential was not remarkable. lvh is elevated at 599, ast ismost recently 22. a urinalysis on 12/07/19 was negative forprotein. no reportive cast was made. a cea was notable for a levelof 2.4 on 1/05/20. an echocardiogram obtained on 12/22/19demonstrated normal lv size with mild concentric lvh and preservedlv function. the right ventricle was mildly dilated andhypertrophied with mild reduction in rv function. there was tracemr with moderate tr. a peak systolic artery pressure of 64 plusright atrial pressure was noted. in summary dr. rodriquez is a 77-year-old gentleman with a clear cutpulmonary hypertension. the etiology of this is not clear at themoment. differential diagnosis could include chronic thromboembolicdisease, occult underlying pulmonary disease (doubt), obstructivesleep apnea, and collagen vascular disease. in addition somepatients develop a marked pulmonary artery hypertension in thesetting of stiff left ventricle even with preserved leftventricular function although this i think would be a diagnosis ofexclusion. the degree of his edema is quite striking and i agreewith increasing his diuretic regimen. i'm embarking on a course ofevaluation to exclude the most likely causes. in specific he willbe having a ct with iv contrast to rule out chronic thromboembolicdisease this afternoon. this has already been arranged by dr.faust. in addition i'm sending serology including an ana, anantidouble stranded dna and an anti scl70. i've also asked dr. rodriquezpage 4freeman faust, m.d. re: jacob rodriquez, m.d. january 18, 2120to undergo polysonography to exclude obstructive sleep apnea. hewill be following up with our pulmonary function lab to have formalpulmonary function testing performed in addition to having anarterial blood gas drawn. if this evaluation should be unrevealing,he may require more invasive diagnostics. i've already consultedformally with dr. eddie roy, the physician with mostexperience in pulmonary hypertension at this hospital and he wouldbe able to assist us in the further evaluation of dr. rodriquez if ourworkup is nondiagnostic.  dr. faust, thank you again for referring dr. rodriquez for evaluation.i'll plan on seeing him in approximately three to four weeks afterhis diagnostic tests have been performed. please do not hesitate tocall me with any further questions or concerns. sincerely, jose church, m.d./raydd: 01/18/20dt: 01/19/:0dv: 01/18/20
