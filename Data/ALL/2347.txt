polyglandular autoimmune syndrome initially admitted in may to ficu for suicide overdose then transferred to whittier rehab hospital 4 for depression , who was transferred to the medical floor for a syncopal episode and hypotension to 60 systolic that returned to baseline with 2.5l ivf who was subsequently transferred to the cmed csru for a recurrent episode of hypotension , fevers and concern for sepsis .initially when she arrived to the floor she was afebrile , normotensive without signs of orthostasis , had a negative ua , a clear chest xray and no signs / symptoms of a fever .she was slightly tachycardic .she was initially not started on antibiotics .she was given a standing ivf order .overnight she became febrile to 102.3 , increasingly tachycardic to 125 , and hypotensive to 80 systolic .she was started on stress dose steroids and levo , flagyl , and vanco .she was given 4l of fluid boluses and transfered to the cmed csru .in the cmed csru , repeated attempts to place lines were unsuccessful .the above treatments were continued .urine cultures returned with 10-100,000 organisms coag negative staph .blood cultures remained negative .vital signs stabilized and she was transfered back to the medical floor after 2 days in the icu .stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course , antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone , and a r hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation .echo showed normal function , trace ar , and no mr .she had a normal ruq us , as well .on the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically without recurrent fever and was stable for transfer back to franciscan children 's hospital & rehab center 4 .at the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion , na was elevated , as was blood pressure .on recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms . ) .1. hypotension :patient presented after episode of hypotension and syncope on mass. mental health center 5 .initially it was felt that this was a result of poor po intake .she was afebrile without orthostatic vital signs nor hypotension .she had no symptoms of infectious source , normal ua , normal chest xray , and no symptoms nor signs of injury after her fall with syncope .neuro exam was normal .subsequently overnight , she developed a fever to 102.3 and recurrent hypotension in the setting of fevers and tachycardia that was concerning for an infectious source .she still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative .ruq us was ordered and returned without signs of infection later .she was started on stress dose steroids .she had cultures drawn , was given tylenol ( tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative , as was a urine tox ) , was started on levofloxacin , metronidazole , and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia , gi sources , and a potential hip infection .her transaminases were slightly elevated , which was later attributed to shock liver as a result of her period of hypotension .lipase and amylase remained normal .in the icu she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease ( she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam ) , and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening .urine culture twice grew 10-100,000 coag negative staph .a line could not be placed for technical reasons , however after 4l ns on the floor and 01-30 more in the icu via peripheral iv 's she was stable .she remained hemodynamically stable with good uop in the setting of being started on abx and stress dose steroids .the steroids were thought to have helped significantly in in the setting of addison 's with possibely superimposed infection .the patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone / fludrocortisone dose .2. elevated lfts :lfts wre elevated at presentation .initially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension , hepatitis , cholangitis or choledocholithiasis .hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time .3. hypoparathyroidism :this is a chronic problem .calcium levels were followed with a goal to keep them around 8.0 by continuing calcium carbonate , calcitriol .the pt required calcium gluconate x1 the day prior to discharge .per endocrine at the time of discharge , the pt may need an increase in calcium po , but at this time they recommended no change .it will need to be monitored over time .4. addison 's- the patient is on basal prednisone / fludrocortisone .these were initially continued as above and later , when she became hypotensive and febrile , stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone .at the time of discharge , her potassium had been low despite repletion ,na was elevated , as was blood pressure .on recommendation from endocrine , her fludrocortisone was decreased from 0.2 to 0.1 ( higher than required doses of fludrocort can cause these symptoms. ) .5. dm :light followed the patient .she was continued on her prior dose of steroids with sliding scale per patient using a 1:15 carb counting scheme with a 1:30 correction factor .on the day of discharge her glargine was decreased by one unit because her glucose remained somewhat low in the mornings .6. r hip pain :later in her hospital course , the pt complained of hip pain .a r hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement .pain was controlled with tylenol and the pt was reassured .pt was consulted .the pt uses a wheelchair often at baseline due to pain from arthritis .7. depression :the pt was being treated at mediplex rehab hospital 4 for suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt on original admission with tylenol and oxycodone .she had planned this attempt carefully without the knowledge of those close to her and very much expected her attempt to work .she had been depressed for some time but her loved ones were very surprised at her attempt .she remained very depressed at her inpatient admission and refractory to treatment .one day prior to her transfer to the medical floor she was sectioned to initiate ect , which she had previously refused .as a result , she was maintained on her ativan , mirtazapine , risperidone , duloxetine .she did not exhibit psychotic symptoms .she had a 1:1 sitter at all times .she denied any suicidality but did endorse depression .she denied hi , si , and illusions / hallucinations .her mood appeared stable throughout her hospitalization .she was followed by psychiatry in consultation while she was on the medical floor .the patient did have heparin subcutaneously while on the medical floor and in the icu .she remained full code throughout the hospitalization .as on prior hospitalization , her hcp was shared by dianne white .medications on admission :meds on transfer :fludrocortisone acetate 0.2 mg po daily 07-12 @ 1033acetaminophen 650
