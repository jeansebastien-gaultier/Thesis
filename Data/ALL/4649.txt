if her 02 sat of 78% in the ed is true, this should be pursued if cardiac evaluation is negative. specifically could she have an interstitial pulmonary process corresponding to imaging and exam w/ fine crackles. arguing against this is the acuteness of her symptoms. continue current regimen w/ holding avandia and metformin.page #96082signed electronically by oconnell, philip d on feb 05, 2092
