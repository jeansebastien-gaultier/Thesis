essentially was admitted to [hospital6 2018] for ep ablation.  the patient had been admitted to[hospital1 ]-gluver on [2-10] through [2-24].  thepatient complained of left heart palpitations with weakness,dry cough, no nausea, fever, chills or vomiting.  the patientdid have a little bit of yellow mucous when social historyawoke on [2-10] with palpitations, notified her primarycare physician who noted [name initial (pre) ] heartrate of 180 and sent her tothe emergency room.  the patient did have a history of atrialtachycardia but it had been quiescent.  the patient had along ventriculoperitoneal tachycardiac narrow complex at 139,a dopamine drip was terminated but recurred.  sotalol andmetoprolol was added.  cardizem eventually was made p.o.blood pressure had been limiting.  on [2-12] ? thepatient had had surgery for repair of gastric ulcerperforation.  records are not available at this timeregarding that procedure.  the patient had near total gastricoutlet obstruction, silk suture closed and placement ofjejunostomy tube and gastrostomy tube.  right internaljugular line was placed at the same time.  it was hard tocontrol the patient's arrhythmias and was originallytransferred to dr.[name (ni) 1565] service for ep ablation.however, the procedure was cancelled secondary to the patientdeveloping a fever.  on transfer to the medicine intensivecare unit the patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain,dizziness and was evaluated in the medicine intensive careunit.past medical history:  significant for hypothyroidism,hypertension, paroxysmal atrial

sounds, erythema andpus coming from the gastrostomy tube site.laboratory data:  studies at an outside hospital,computerized tomography scan noted right greater than leftpleural effusion, ascites free air.  bilateral renal cysts.electrocardiogram on [2-25] noted supraventriculartachycardia, 160s, left axis deviation, scalloped 1, 2,flatter st waves in v2 through v6.  white count on admissionwas 16,

methicillin-resistant staphylococcusaureus positive for urine on [2152-2-25].hospital course:  on [2-11] at the outside hospital shewas in normal sinus rhythm, within normal limits.  on[2-17], narrow tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia120s to 130 with rare related st changes.  the patient wasplaced on telemetry.  rate was in the 180s after examination.repeat blood pressure noted the patient to be in 80s/40s. thepatient was then sent to the medical floor for fever workup.diltiazem drip was started for tachycardia.  the patientbecame hypotensive.  the patient was transferred to thecoronary care unit for treatment of hypotension andconcomitant atrial tachycardia as well as fever workup.  on[2152-2-27], the patient was noted to have a rightpneumothorax, status post right internal jugular lineplacement.  chest tube was placed.  the patient was alsonoted to have methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus inthe urine and gastrotomy tube.  esmolol drip andneosynephrine drip were started for her hypotension.  on[2-29], the patient underwent the ablation procedure.esmolol and amiodarone were discontinued.  the patient wasweaned off of neosynephrine.  on [3-1], the patient wastaken off of pressors and was placed on maintenance fluid.the patient was also noted to have clostridium difficile.the patient was transferred to the floor on [2152-3-1].  chart was reviewed and the patient was seen andexamined.in summary, the patient is an 83 year old female withhypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, atrial tachycardia,transferred from the outside hospital status post surgicalrepair for a duodenal ulcer and was sent to [hospital6 1760] for ep ablation for atrialtachycardia.  the patient was admitted to coronary care unitsecondary to decreased blood pressure in the setting ofintravenous calcium channel blocker for rate control, lymphassist and tachycardia.  intensive care unit course thought aright pneumothorax secondary to attempted internal jugularline placement.  the patient underwent successful ablation ofatrial tachycardia, atrial flutter on [2-28].infectious disease issues included clostridium difficile instool, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus pyuria inurine in the setting of foley catheterization.  on the floorthe patient remained stable and had numerous complaints ofpain.  the patient had no cardiac events.  the patient wasplaced on flagyl for a 14 day course, 500 mg b.i.d.  thepatient was on vancomycin intravenously 750 q. 18 for acourse of seven days.  the patient got tube feeds via thegastrostomy tube.  the patient is to be screened forrehabilitation to assist with placement.  the patient'slaboratory data indicated the patient was generallyhypophosphatemic and would supplement as such.  the patient'stsh was also elevated to 25 and we would be increasing hersynthroid dose.discharge diagnosis:1.  status post ep ablation for atrial tachycardia2.  clostridium difficile in stool3.  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus
