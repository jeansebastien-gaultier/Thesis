recommended to exclude the possibility of underlyinginfectious process.brief hospital course:61m with esrd s/p crt, htn, dm, admitted with dyspnea and arf.during ir placement of an hd catheter he suffered a pea arrest x2. he was cooled using artic sun protocol. he slowly recovered,but his hospitalization was complicated by prolonged intubationleading to tacheostomy placement, psuedomonas uti, hap,stenotrophomonas pna, aspiration pna, acute on chronic kidneyinjury leading to loss of fuction of his transplanted kidney,ivc thombosis, spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrage duringheparinization for his thrombus, gout flair, and altered mentalstatus which has slowly improved. after more than a month in thehospital he has stabilized, is ambulating with assistance,speaking through a passe muir valve, and tolerating tube feeds..# aspiration:  patient had emesis [2107-12-13] and aspirated tubefeeds. developed aspiration pneumonitis vs. aspiration pna. cxrshowed no clear evidence of pna but ct showed confluentconsolidative opacity of superior rll. pt was febrile followingaspiration event and ended up re-intubated. now s/p 7-day courseof vanc/zosyn for aspiration that ended on [2107-12-18]. respiratorystatus has dramatically improved and he is now on trach maskonly. he had a video swallow evaluation on [2107-12-20] which showedsilent aspiration.  it was suggested that he have a diet ofnectar thick liquids and soft consistency solids.  meds must becrushed in purees with q6 hour oral care.  he should have followup with speech therapy at rehab with repeat video swallow ifdiet is to be advanced..# stenotrophomonas pna: diagnosed from repeated sputum cultures.on bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[12-16] to d/c [12-30]. note thatbactrim must be give following hd as it is dialyzed off.intially diagnosed [12-2], but was inadquately treated as bactrimwas given prior to hd rather than after..# pseudomonas uti: had a long course of cefepime for ucxpositive for pseudomonas x 2..# line infection: s/p cefepime initially for uti. then linezolidwas added for purulent appearing cvl. his lines were exchangedand complicated by pea arrest during procedure. his cvl grew outmicrococcus. according to id, the cefepime should have coveredit. he received a 14d course of cefepime and 9d course oflinezolid. a picc line and new hd line were placed and have hadno further complications..# labile blood pressures: pt had been intermittently hypotensive(infectious source vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency). hisinfections were treated. he was given stress dose steroids. hewas on pressors for hypotension. ultimately this resolved and hebecame persistently hypertensive to the 190s to 220s. he wasstarted on a labetalol drip as well as prn hydralazine. he hasbeen transitioned from labetalol drip to po labetalol on [12-9],then switched to labetalol prn. on [12-14], labetalol was d/c??????ed.continue atenolol at 50mg daily. continue lisinopril 10mg daily..# foot pain:

[month (only) 116] need suppressive allopurinol in the future forhis gout..# dvt: patient found to have venous thrombi in several vesselsincluding his ivc.  he was on a heparin drip, being bridged withcoumadin.  however, all anticoagulation stopped when liverhematoma developed (see helow). hematology was consultedregarding whether it is appropriate to resume anticoagulationgiven the risk of bleed, and recommended sc heparin tid until hefollows up with hematology and possibly vascular surgeryregarding possible benefits vs. risks of an ivc filterplacement. the patient should not be anti-coagulated with agentsother than sc heparin given his high risk of bleed..# abdominal distension:  patient??????s abdomen became distended andtympanitic during this hospitalization. ct abdomen [12-11] showedlarge liver hematoma with scattered areas of perihepatichematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery but withoutdefinite sites of active extravasation.  distension likely [2-7]chemical peritonitis which is resolving following reversal ofanticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[last name (un) ]??????s syndrome frominfection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, orrespiratory failure.  this is consistent with the patient??????scontinued +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but ct abdomen did notshow dilated r side of colon and loops of bowel were read aswnl.  currently improved abdominal pain and minimally improveddistension. abd is much less tense than prior.  continue reglan2.5mg tid standing for treatment of presumed diabeticgastroparesis. advancing diet as tolerated with tube feeds..# liver hematoma:  as above, ct showed hematoma of liver whileon heparin drip for ivc thombus.  ir consulted re: possibleembolization, did not feel the bleed was acute (felt >48 hoursold) and wished to preserve hepatic artery and liver function ifpossible, so recommended monitoring hct.  general surgeryconsulted re: possible relation to peg placement, but did notbelieve this was [2-7] procedure based on the location of thehematoma.  recommended montoring q6h hct and coags, transfusingas needed and keeping hct >20.  received total of 3 unit prbcafter reversal of ptt with ffp. awaiting hematologyrecommendation for long term anticoagulation given presence ofivc thombus but complication of hemorrhage. (ultimately decidedto hold all anticoagulation given severity of liver bleed.).# respiratory failure. originally intubated in setting of arrestwith hypoxia beforehand. was very difficult to wean from ventdue to persistent hypoxia, recurrent pna, and altered mentalstatus. trach and peg placed on [12-2]. now stable on trach. hadaspiration even as above leading to short tern re-intubation.now tolerating trach mask. speaking with passe muir valve..# altered mental status s/p pea arrest: s/p pea arrest x 2.underwent artic sun cooling protocol. suring weaning of sedationwas severely agitated. ultimately was transitioned from fentanylto methadone and then weaned on seroquel. he had a significantset back from his liver hematoma and aspiration pna. neuro wasconsulted and noted a staring spell that was concerning forseizures. he was monitored with continuous eeg, which showedepileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. neurorecommended startingkeppra, with keppra 500mg qday and an extra250mg after hd. the patient has slowly improved and is notconversant, [location (un) 1131], walking with assistance, and no longeragitated. he is alert and oriented..# acute on chronic renal failure. he is s/p crt in [2101].etiology of arf likely multifactorial due to hypotension frompea, sepsis, contrast loads, and nephrotoxic drugs. her therenal service, he will not recover renal function of his kidney.he will require hd henceforth. continue prednisone 5mg po dailyfor rejection as well as renagel 800 tid, sevelemer 800 tid..# fen:  speech and swallow recs -
