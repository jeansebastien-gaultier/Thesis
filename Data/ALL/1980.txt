diagnosis: chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseexacerbation.problem list: 1. polymyalgia rheumatica.2. lumbar disk disease.3. hypertension.4. cor pulmonale.5. tobacco smoker.history of the present illness: the patient is a 62 year old womanwith a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency wardwith a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. she wasintubated for somnolence and worsening respiratory acidosis , andtransferred to the micu. she had never had any intubationspreviously. she is an active smoker with a long history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease who is followed by dr. jerald fennermost recently , she was admitted on 8/5/92 for a chronicobstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation which was treated withaggressive bronchodilators. her baseline abg on discharge was7.39 , pc02 51.1 , and a p02 of 66 with 91.3% 02 saturation. she hada previous sleep apnea study on 5/25 which was negative. hermost recent thyroid function tests on 8/6 revealed an fev1 of 38%and an fvc of 51% , with an fev1/fvc of less than 80%. this wasfelt to be consistent with a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern.she has been treated with theophylline and proventil as well ashome nebulizers , lasix , and 02 overnight. she continues to smokeas well as noted above. she has had frequent episodes of cough andproductive sputum as well as lower extremity edema. she nowpresents with one to two weeks of increase in her postnasal drip ,denying any change in her cough or sputum production although shedid note a slightly increased temperature. she began to becomemore short of breath and was taken to the emergency ward by hersister. there , she was found to be cyanotic with an 02 saturationof 59%. her first blood gas on 50% was 7.27 , pco2 79 , p02 78%saturation after one nebulizer treatment. her peak flows afterthree nebulizers were only 90. she began to become somnolent witha repeat blood gas showing a pco2 of 94 , and was thereforeintubated and transferred to the micu. past medical history: wasremarkable for ( 1 ) asthma/copd , ( 2 ) polymyalgia rheumatica , ( 3 )borderline hypertension , ( 4 ) lumbar disk disease , ( 5 ) psoriasis ,( 6 ) right sided heart failure , ( 7 ) spinal stenosis , ( 8 ) sinusitis ,( 9 ) obesity. past surgical history: status post cholecystectomyin 1979 , status post back surgery. medications on admission:theo-dur 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , kcl , lodine 300mg p.o. b.i.d. , proventil nebulizers p.r.n. , supplemental 02 q.h.s.allergies: she is allergic to sulfa which causes her to have arash. habits: she continues to smoke , and she has a history of 40pack years. there is no alcohol use. social history: she livesalone. she has two sons. she is assisted by her sister.physical examination: on admission , she was an intubated , obesefemale in no acute distress. her bloodpressure was 140/70 , pulse 70-100 , and temperature of 101.6. heentwas unremarkable. neck: supple with no jugular venous distention.lungs revealed diffuse wheezes with an i:e ratio of 1:4. heart:tachycardiac with a normal s1 , s2 , without murmurs , rubs , orgallops. breasts: no masses. abdomen: obese , mild tenderness todeep palpation , normal bowel sounds. extremities: 2+ edema to hercalves bilaterally , no clubbing. pulses were 2+ dorsalis pedispulses. on neurological exam , she was awake but lethargic anddifficult to arouse , but was able to move all extremities. herreflexes were 2+ and symmetric bilaterally.laboratory data: on admission , sodium 138 , potassium 4.4 , chloride98 , bicarbonate 36 , bun 10 , creatinine 0.6 ,glucose 113. her liver function tests were within normal limits.her white count was 9.96 , 76 polys , 15 lymphs. her hematocrit was47.6% with 265 , 000 platelets. the pt was 11.4 , and the ptt was30.5. theophylline level was 5.3. abg's were as mentioned above.post intubation , abg 7.45 , pco2 41 , p02 57 , with 91% saturation.the most recent echocardiogram in 1/11 revealed mild concentricleft ventricular hypertrophy and normal left ventricular function.the chest x-ray revealed an increased heart size with noinfiltrates. the urinalysis revealed too numerous to count whiteblood cells and 4+ bacteria. cultures eventually grew out e. coli.ekg revealed normal sinus rhythm with an axis of +8 , right bundlebranch block , inverted t's in v1 and v2 , but no significant changecompared with 11/1hospital course: the patient was admitted and continued on theventilator until 3/6/93. she was given aggressivebronchodilator treatment via nebulizers , albuterol and atropent.she was started on iv solu-medrol dose which was rapidly tapered ona p.o. schedule. she also received two days of iv ceftriaxone tocover a possible tracheobronchitis. she was also continued on herancef as well. her urinary tract infection was treated via theceftriaxone. she did well over the next two days and essentiallywas ready for extubation on this regimen on 3/6/93. she waswatched overnight and did continue to do well , and was transferredto the floor on 6/14/93. by this time , her 02 saturations were 92%on two liters. she was afebrile , and her peak flows were improvingwith continued albuterol nebulizers and atrovent inhaler. herpolymyalgia rheumatica remained stable during her admission. therewas a question whether or not her urinary tract infection wasadequately treated as she had several repeat cultures growing 5 , 000colonies of staph aureus and one also growing diphtheroids. thesewere clean catches. she had it repeated one more time as a cleancatch , and this was found to grow probable pseudomonas species ,with an exact speciation pending. this last culture on 5/17/93 wasassociated with an urinalysis that was without white cells. becauseof this and because of the low cell count , i did not feel that itwas necessary to treat the positive culture until a straight cathspecimen was obtained. the patient was informed that if herdysuria were to persist that she was to call dr. gigger immediately ,but that otherwise , her urine was most likely noninfected. shealso received a sleep study on 1/16/93 which revealed that heroxygen saturations dropped to 46% during rem sleep. this was at apoint when she appeared not to be breathing , and therefore had anelement of essential sleep apnea. she also during periods ofnon-rem sleep alternated between breathing against an obstructionand not breathing at all. this revealed that she also has acomponent of obstructive sleep apnea as well. she was started onprogesterone as an outpatient and will continue to be followed forevaluation for possible nasal c-pap. the patient was discharged on8/19/93 with a continued good airflow and much fewer wheezes thanpreviously. there were no complications.disposition: discharge medications: progesterone 20 mg p.o.t.i.d. , albuterol 0.5 cc in 2.5 normal saline q4hours p.r.n. , atrovent inhaler two puffs p.o. q4 hours , prednisonetaper 50 mg p.o. q.d. times two tapering down to 10 mg p.o. q.d.with four days of each dose , continued home 02 at night , ampicillin500 mg p.o. q.i.d. , lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. , lodine 300 mg p.o.b.i.d. , theo-dur 300 mg p.o. t.i.d. , and kcl 40 meq p.o. q.d. thepatient is to be followed up by dr. cormany on 3/17/93. the patientwill also have evaluation of her cataracts by ophthalmology on thesame date.dictated by: lacy v. grandi , m.d. jh7attending: cristopher j. storey , m.d. vm4dj114/7129batch: 2156 index no. oasuyp9aqm d: 7/5/93t:
