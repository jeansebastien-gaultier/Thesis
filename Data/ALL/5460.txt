systolic pressure at 38.assessment and plan: this is an 80 years old female with historyof afib and chf , diastolic dysfunction with ef of 80% and copdwho was recently discharged for chf w low dose lasix of 20mg nowis found to be in chf in a setting with suspected afib with lvr.the patient also had acute on chronic renal insufficiency likelysecondary to low flow from her volume status. the patient wasadmitted for diuresis and for the rate control.hospital course by system:ischemia: there is no evidence of ischemia. the patient wasruled out with serial enzymes. she was continued on aspirin , nobetablocker , and short acting diltiazem and statin. herbeta-blocker was initially not initiated , however , on three daysprior to discharge , she was started on short-dose beta-blockadedue to hypertension. she tolerated that reasonably well ,however , did have episodes of bradycardia to 40s. decision wasreached to defer starting betablockade on her until herappointment with her cardiologist. her bb was discontinued.pump: the patient was volume over loaded on chest x-ray with bnpgreater than 500. the patient has ef of 80% with hypodynamicheart. the patient was diuresing initially with 80 iv lasix andsubsequently increased to 120 b.i.d. of iv lasix. she wasdiuresed slowly at about 500 ml everyday. ultimately , her lasixwas switched over to 160 p.o. b.i.d. with very good diuresis , buther creatinine was elevated , prompting decreasing her lasix backdown to 120 p.o. b.i.d. she will continue on this dose ondischarge and has a followup with her primary care physician forcreatinine trial and make sure that her creatinine is trendingdown. we did not want to over diuresis the patient given hervolume dependence and the diastolic dysfunction especially as wesuspect that the heart failure is secondary to her rhythm , butnot really significant volume overload. she had a repeat chestx-ray three days prior to admission , which shows slightlyimproving pulmonary edema and pulmonary effusion. she was torepeat lytes and her creatinine was followed very closely.rhythm: she was in afib w rvr initially. the patient wasstarted on diltiazem t.i.d. we hold her dig initially as herlevel was elevated to 2.4 eventually. her dig was restarted at0.125 mg p.o. every three days. her dig level will need to befollowed as an outpatient. her dig was stable on this particulardose. we also started her on short acting beta-blocker withlopressor at 6.25 t.i.d. she will be reduced to 6.25 b.i.d. ondischarge. the patient tolerated the lopressor though had a fewepisodes of bradycardia. bb was d/c on discharge.pulmonary: the patient has shortness of breath , despitesecondary to chf and copd. the patient was given nebs and heradvair. she was on 4 liter of oxygen on discharge and she willbe self-weaned at home to 2 liter as possible.heme: she has chronic baseline shortness of breath. she wascontinued on her coumadin for anticoagulation. inr was stablethroughout the hospital stay.renal: has acute renal insufficiency on chronic renalinsufficiency. her avapro was held initially. suspect that heracute renal insufficiency is secondary to poor flow in thesetting of afib and atrial flutter and failure. her renalfunction actually improved slightly upon diuresis , however , shebumped her creatinine slightly on discharge secondary tohigh-dose lasix. her lasix will be decreased to 120 b.i.d. p.o.on discharge and her creatinine will be checked two days afterdischarge.id: no evidence of infection. she has some sputum that was sentwith normal flora. blood culture and urine culture was negative.chest pa and lateral was also negative for any evidence ofconsolidation or infection.fen: she was kept on the low-salt ada diet , cardiac diet with kand mag repletion.prophylasix: pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and also on appi.code status: she was full code.disposition: she is to follow up with her primary care physicianand also cardiologist. she has appointment dr. kohli on3/24/2006 at 2:40 p.m. and dr. mccarl , the cardiologist on2/25/2006 at 8:40 a.m.discharge medication: she is on aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily , duoneb3/0.5
