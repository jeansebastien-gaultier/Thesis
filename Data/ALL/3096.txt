thrombocytopenic purpura .2 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .3 ) renal failure requiring chronic dialysis .history of present illness :the patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from pre health on june 19 , 1998 to the verg medical center intensive care unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .on may 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to pre health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .she was treated with clindamycin and erythromycin which were changed to trovan and then transferred to a hospital .on may 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to pre health intensive care unit .chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .a vq scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .on may 24 , 1998 , the patient had a ct scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .at this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ana was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative .she was started on a steroid trial at that point .her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .on june 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .the patient was then started on 40 mg of prednisone q. day .from may 27 , 1998 through june 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .on june 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the verg medical center medical intensive care unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .past medical history :1 ) cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .2 ) hypertension .3 ) status post hysterectomy .4 ) status post appendectomy .medications on transfer :1 ) albuterol inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.2 ) lasix p.r.n.3 ) prednisone 40 mg p.o. q. day .4 ) inderal 40 mg p.o. q.i.d.5 ) thiamine .6 ) lasix p.r.n.7 ) atrovent inhaler 4 puffs q.i.d.8 ) folic acid .9 ) premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .10 ) omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .11 ) insulin sliding scale .allergies :the patient had no known drug allergies .social history :the patient is divorced .she has two children .she recently retired as a clerical worker .she denies any tobacco .she has only social alcohol use .family history :father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .brother has coronary artery disease .there is no family history of hematologic problems .laboratory :laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , bun 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and ldh 496 .hospital course :1 ) bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :the video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .the patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .this was changed to solu-medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .by discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .the patient &apos;s bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on july 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .repeat chest x-rays and chest ct scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient &apos;s pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .at the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .2 ) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :the patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , ldh of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .this was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on june 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through july 27 , 1999 .she was also changed to intravenous solu-medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of prednisone prior to discharge .her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on july 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on july 20 , 1999 .her ldh which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .she continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .the patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after july 27 , 1999 .after this , the patient &apos;s platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .it is felt that the patient &apos;s thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .she will continue on her prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .3 ) renal :the patient presented in acute renal failure with a bun of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .throughout the month of june , she had a rising potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on july 12 , 1998 .the opinion of the renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .she required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .during the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .4 ) infectious disease :the patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on june 23 , 1998 , july 4 , 1998 , july 8 , 1998 and july 9 , 1998 .the patient eventually had a left subclavian tesio catheter placed and a right brachial picc line placed on july 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .she received a full three week course of vancomycin and also received a three week course of ceftazidime .in addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received levofloxacin times fourteen days .she also received a fourteen day course of acyclovir which was begun on june 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .she was also on fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .the patient was also started on bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .5 ) rheumatology :the patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ana of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and anca were negative .unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .a repeat ana , rheumatoid factor and anca may be repeated as an outpatient .follow-up :1 ) the patient will follow-up with her primary care physician , dr. tamarg study , in arvus after she is discharged from rehabilitation .2 ) the patient is being discharged to a hospital where she will receive onsite hemodialysis three times per week on monday , wednesday and friday .the nephrologist who will follow her there is dr. study .3 ) the patient will continue to have her cbc , ldh , bilirubin , chem-7 and magnesium and calcium checked with each dialysis and the results will be faxed to dr. ian zineisfreierm , the hematology attending at fax number 751-329-8840 .4 ) the patient will eventually need a permanent dialysis fistula .the left subclavian tesio which she has in place will last for several months in the mean time .she would like to arrange to have her fistula placed at pre health and the vascular surgeons there should be contacted regarding this .5 ) the patient will need packed red blood cell transfusions with dialysis when her hematocrit falls below 26 .6 ) the patient will continue her prednisone at 40 mg p.o. q. day times one month ( this was started on july 27 , 1999 ) and then she will begin a slow taper as guided by pulmonary .7 ) the patient has a follow-up appointment in the pulmonary clinic with dr. cedwi stone at 336-2931 on august 30 , 1999 at 1:40 pm .8 ) the patient has a follow-up appointment with dr. ian zineisfreierm at the we erthunt hospital at 180-0455 on august 15 , 1999 at 12:30 pm .medications on discharge :1 ) calcitriol 0.25 mcg p.o. q. day .2 ) tums 1250
