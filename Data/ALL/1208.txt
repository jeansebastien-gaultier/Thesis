present illness: mr. mauras is a 72-year-old man withhistory of cad status post cabg , pci with history of stableangina , type 2 diabetes , peripheral vascular disease , formersmoking history and also history of seizure disorder withcataracts and recently discharged after an admission for atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response. he had occasionalanginal symptoms prior to discharge. he took about twonitroglycerins per week. over the past week , he had escalatingchest pain requiring one nitroglycerin per day. the pain wasrelieved by rest and nitroglycerin. one week prior to admission ,his digoxin was stopped and his amiodarone was decreased. hisplavix was stopped and his coumadin was held. on the morning ofadmission , he had chest pain. he had two nitroglycerins andrested but the pain persisted. he was taken to the ed. in theed , he received lopressor , enalapril , lovenox treatment dose anda plavix load.past medical history: includes cad , hypertension , chf , diabetes ,hypercholesterolemia , peripheral vascular disease and pastsmoking history.allergies: to penicillin.social history: significant for past alcohol and smokinghistory. he quit alcohol 25 years ago.physical examination: significant for afebrile , heart rate 45and blood pressure 95/50. he had a left surgical pupil , left eyeptosis at baseline. his heart had no murmurs , rubs or gallops.his lungs were clear. his abdomen was soft , nontender andnondistended. he had bilateral femoral bruits , 2+ distal pulses.no pronator drift.labs: significant for hematocrit baseline at 30 to 32 , whitecount of 13. his troponin peaked at 6.4.ekg showed st depressions in v3 through v6 that were new.echocardiogram on 8/11/05 showed an ef of 25 to 30% with septalakinesis lateral and posterior hypokinesis and mild tricuspidregurgitation.chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema.hospital course: hospital course for this 72-year-old man withnon-st-elevation mi.1. cardiovascular: a catheterization on hospital day 1 showedfour-vessel disease. no intervention was taken at that point , asit was unclear which region was the culprit. afterwards , he wasin hypotensive respiratory distress , likely secondary to flashpulmonary edema. he received lasix and morphine and he wasstarted on a nitro drip with improvement in symptoms. he wasfound to have flash pulmonary edema and in atrial fibrillationwith rapid ventricular response. he was taken back to thecatheterization lab and given four stents to his saphenous veingraft , om1 with good resolution of his symptoms and he went tothe ccu afterwards. on hospital day 3 , he was transferred to thefloor and was given an amiodarone load given his ejectionfraction and increased ectopy on telemetry. his troponin hadbeen trended down to the 0.2s by discharge. his beta-blocker andace inhibitor were titrated to heart rate and blood pressure.prior to anticipated discharge , he re-developed flash pulmonaryedema secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricularresponse. electrophysiology consult evaluated him and based onhis prior ejection fraction symptoms , it was decided to place adual-chamber pacemaker with aicd. he has had no respiratoryevents since that placement. he has remained in atrialfibrillation and was re-loaded with digoxin. he was started onhis coumadin two days prior to discharge and was not yettherapeutic. his repeat echo did show an ef of 55%. this wasafter the pacemaker was placed.2. renal: he has chronic renal insufficiency. he was givenmucomyst precath with good effect. his
