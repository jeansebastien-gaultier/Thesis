felix mddiagnosis:respiratory failure , fluid overload.service:medical intensive care unit.history of present illness:mr. bryne is a 67-year-old man with history of multifactorialhypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure with a recent prolongedstay at the fordtist hospital medical intensive careunit ( 8/1/06 - 3/10/06 ) who was discharged to stown valley medical center with tracheostomy and peg on 3/10/06 . thepatient had done well at rehab with significant improvement inhis pulmonary status to the point that he was off the ventilatorusing a nasal cannula for supplementary oxygen only. he also hadsignificant improvement in his functional status with ability tostand and ambulate for short distances as well as improvement inhis mental status back to baseline. however , over the severaldays prior to this admission his respiratory status had beendeteriorating with an increasing respiratory rate , increased workof breathing , and falling oxygen saturations. for the last twonights prior to admission , the patient had to be bagged overnightand was not able to maintain saturations above the high 80s. hehad been afebrile with no change in cough or secretions. hedenied any abdominal pain , vomiting , or diarrhea. he was startedon empiric levofloxacin on the day prior to admission as well assome increased diuresis with an increase in his standing lasixdose to 40 mg iv q. 8h. according to the patient's wife , thisdid improve his respiratory status somewhat; however , he wasstill unable to remain oxygen saturation above 90%. the patientalso received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocritof 25 the day prior to admission. the morning of admission toronon health it was felt that the patient'srespiratory distress and poor oxygenation were such that heneeded to return to ventilator assistance. the patient was thentransferred to the prinin health emergencydepartment where on arrival his vitals were notable for a heartrate of 76 , blood pressure 123/62 , respirations 28 , oxygensaturation of 92% by nasal cannula. he was placed on theventilator at pressure support with 10 of pressure support and 5of peak with an fio2 of 50%. arterial blood gas at this time was7.38 , 66 , and 63.past medical history:1. diabetes mellitus ( hemoglobin a1c of approximately 10 ).2. morbid obesity , likely obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.3. status post tracheostomy and peg placement after pmh micustay for hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure , 8/1/06 to3/10/06 .4. status post crush injury to bilateral lower extremities ,followed by right below the knee amputation and surgicalreconstruction of the left lower extremity.5. l3 radiculopathy.6. hypertension.7. left internal capsule cva in 1997 with residual chronic finemotor deficits of the left hand , chronic mild word-findingdifficulty , short-term memory loss , mild left lower extremityweakness and left foot drop.8. right lower extremity prosthesis.9. history of left dvt on coumadin.10. chronic shortness of breath.11. likely sleep apnea.12. urinary frequency.13. iritis: right eye recurrent episodes , negativerheumatologic workup.14. central blindness , left eye , since childhood.medications on transfer to o hospital :levofloxacin 750 mg p.o. daily started 5/23/06 , coumadin 3 mg atbedtime , lasix 40 mg iv t.i.d. started 5/23/06 , labetalol 200 mgt.i.d. , simvastatin 80 mg at bedtime , aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily , lantus 56 units at bedtime ,tiotropium 18 mcg daily , flovent one puff b.i.d. , sodium chloridenasal spray q.i.d. , albuterol nebulizers p.r.n. , mucomystnebulizers p.r.n. , senna , bisacodyl suppository 10 pr daily ,nystatin swish and spit q.i.d. , ramelton 8 mg at bedtime , haldol5 mg per g-tube at bedtime p.r.n. and haldol 1 mg q. 6h. p.r.n.allergies:the patient has no known drug allergies.social history:the patient has lived with his wife though he has been at rehabsince 3/10/06 . he is a former longshoreman. he isself-educated and an avid reader. his wife is a neonatalintensive care unit attending physician at gno jones medical center .the patient quit use of tobacco in 1995 and does not drinkalcohol. he denies use of any illicit drugs.physical examination:on arrival to wbkh micu , was notable for temperature of 97.3 ,heart rate 68 and normal sinus rhythm , blood pressure 140/56 ,respiratory rate in the 30s , oxygen saturation 92% on pressuresupport 10 and 5 with an fio2 of 50%. the patient was an obesealert man in no acute distress. physical exam notable for coarsebreath sounds anteriorly and diminished breath sounds atbilateral bases , distant heart sounds. right lower extremity hasa bka. left lower extremity with 2+ edema with some chroniccolor change suggestive of venous insufficiency. distal pulsenot palpable.chest x-ray revealed tracheostomy tube in position , a rightpleural effusion , somewhat difficult to evaluate lung bases.echocardiogram 8/1/06 revealed normal size and function of theleft ventricle , normal right ventricle , and a trivial pericardialeffusion.laboratory data:at the time of admission , were notable for a creatinine of 1.3improved from 1.5 at the time of discharge on 3/10/06 .urinalysis revealed 50-100 red blood cells but 0-2 white bloodcells. white blood count was 9.1 with 75 polyps , 14 lymphs , and8 monos. hematocrit was 30.7 , which is at baseline.ekg revealed normal sinus rhythm at 77 , normal axis , normalintervals and less than 1-mm of st depression in leads 2 , 3 , v4through v6.hospital course by system and problem:1. hypoxemic respiratory failure , likely multifactorial fromobesity-hypoventilation syndrome , sleep apnea , question copd.recurrent decompensation was thought to be precipitated by volumeoverload and subsequent pleural effusion. the patient improveddramatically with aggressive diuresis and he was able tosuccessfully transition back to use of trache collar during theday , however , it seems that he does better with ventilatorysupport overnight and current permanent plan of care is totransition patient to home ventilator support such that he willsupplemental oxygen either by nasal cannula or trache collarduring the day and be able to use the ventilator at night. thepatient was also continued on inhaled steroids and nebulizers.2. positive blood culture , 1/4 bottles from blood cultures drawnon 7/26/06 were positive for gram-positive cocci and clusters;however , he was afebrile and with no clinical evidence ofinfection , so this was thought likely to be contaminant and notreatment was given.3. fluid overload. as noted , the patient responded very well todiuresis. he was transitioned to a new stable dose of p.o. lasixnamely 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. this will need to be adjusted asneeded.4. hypertension. the patient was continued on his home regimenof labetalol and amlodipine on which he did well.5. diabetes. the patient was continued on home regimen oflantus , however , this was titrated up somewhat due to someelevated sugars the last few days of his admission. he is sentout on lantus 60 mg subcutaneously at bedtime as well as aregular insulin sliding scale.6. nutrition. the patient should follow a cardiac , diabeticsalt restricted and fluid restricted p.o. diet. he does have apeg tube for supplemental feeding should he be unable to takep.o. but at the time of discharge he is doing well with amechanical soft diet with the above restrictions.7. the patient is therapeutically anticoagulated on coumadin.indication is history of dvt. he will be continued on a dose of3 mg at bedtime. coumadin should be drawn every two daysinitially until it is clear that this is the correct stable dosefor him. it may need to be titrated up or down.code status:the patient is full code.medications at the time of discharge:aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , lasix 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. , labetalol 200mg p.o. t.i.d. , amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily , simvastatin 80 mgp.o. at bedtime , coumadin 3 mg p.o. at bedtime ,
