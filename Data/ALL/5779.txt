trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole   susceptible           a/p: 48m with a hx of dm2, pvd and multiple admissions in the past for le cellulitis in the setting of gangrene. 1.	id: patient is now presenting with appears to be another episode of cellulitis but now probably coming from his l 5th toe lesion. surgery has debrided the wound, sending wound cultures as well as blood cultures. acute om would not be visible on xr changes and clinical picture is more consistent with acute than chronic om. will consider further work up for om if symptoms do not respond to treatment. levo and flagyl were added to unasyn in accord to previous culture data.2.	pvd: will need arterial lenis to assess for vascular patency and flow. continuing acei, and adding asa and lipitor, will order lipid profile and smoking cessation consult.3.	dm2: very poor control last admission, eventhough patient now says he takes medications and checks it up to qid. will order hgba1c and glucose monitoring._______________________________________________________________________name ian jurado md                               pager # 14558pgy-1
