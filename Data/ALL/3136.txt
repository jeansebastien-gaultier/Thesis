record date: 2096-03-10hall, nick6521981603/10/2096youssef nall, m.d.ludlow medical center45 wilder stpost, in  86454dear dr. nall:it was a pleasure to see nick hall again in the cardiology clinic at wytheville south hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.  as you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.  he is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by vt/vf arrest.  he has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.  he does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin a1c has been elevated at 8%.  his prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-st elevation mi and coronary interventions to his lad and rca.  he has subsequently had a vt/vf arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and poba with good results.  he remarkably has had a preserved lv function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.  in 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to wytheville sanitarium hospital emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal lad and rca occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting cypher stents with good results.  since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.we see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.  work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.  he is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.  he has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.  he has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  he has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.  his heart rates have been in 50s-70s.  he has had no side effects to his medications.  he is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.  he says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.his current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.physical examination: nick looked well.  his weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.  his head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.  there are no bruits.  his chest is clear to auscultation.  he was not clubbed.  his cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal s1 and s2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  he had no peripheral edema.  his abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  his pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.ekg:  normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for lvh and left atrial enlargement.  prior inferior q-wave mi.lab values from today:  his electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal lfts, and normal ck level.  tsh was also normal.  hemoglobin a1c was elevated at 6.8%.lipid levels:  total cholesterol 164, tg 145, hdl 33, ldl 102.echocardiogram from last year revealed normal lv ejection fraction of 60%-65%.  mild left atrial enlargement, no lvh.impression:  nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, i think it is time to start an ace inhibitor as we have discussed previously.  we started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.  he will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.  to simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.  we also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.  he was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.with regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.  nevertheless, dr. turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at wsh and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.  the results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature cad etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.  to that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.  we have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor v leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein c and s levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and crp today.otherwise, i believe nick is doing well.  we will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.  if by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.  he may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.  this patient was discussed with dr. turner in clinic.yours

in the internal medicine at wytheville south hospital on 06/14/2098 for routine folow up of radiation associated ischemic heart disease.  as you know, nick had mantle radiation in his youth for hodgkin's lymphoma, and subsequently had 2 nstemis in 2087 and 2090.  he received bare-metal stents to his lad and rca and did well until 2094 when after diagnosis and resection of a squamous cell lung carcinoma, his postop course was immediately complicated by an acute inferior stemi/vt/vf arrest.  immediate angiography post-resuscitation found massive thrombus burden in his proximal right coronary artery, with good result after thrombectomy and poba, in addition to integrilin, aspirin, plavix, and low dose heparin.  remarkably, after an iabp and aggressive care nick walked away with a preserved lv function after this event.  he did well until 01/2095 when he represented with unstable angina and was found to have in-stent restenosis in the ostial lad and the ostial rca bare-metal stents.  he was treated with cypher drug-eluting stents to both lesions (3.5 x 18 mm cypher stent post dilated to 20 atm to the lad and 3.5 x 23 mm extending slightly into the sinus of valsalva to the rca) with no residual stenosis.  because of concerns with regards to recurrent in-stent restenosis he was put on dual antiplatelet therapy (325mg ecasa and clopidogrel 150 mg) since that event intended as longterm therapy.  he has been followed by me since 2095 with no recurrent ischemic heart disease, chest pain, and has returned to normal exercise capacity and with preserved cardiac systolic function.  nick continues to be very successful as a technology consultant in ibm research in leland.  as the economy is picking up, his work environment has improved as has his stress level.  he is walking every day both at work and recreationally and lost another 5pounds.  he takes his medications regularly and is usually compliant  but ran out of atenolol last week and instead has been taking bid ramipril in its place.  every year he asks whether we can down-titrate his clopidogrel both for tolerance and cost reasons (i reassured him that it should be generic within a year).  nevertheless, we tested the degree of platelet inhibition he currently has with the verifynow p2y12 pru assay, and his result was 177, which is below the cut-off of 230 pru thought to approximate adequate platelet inhibition.  he recently had some transient melena for which he was placed on ranitidine.his current medications should be aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, ramipril 10 mg p.o. daily, atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily, l-thyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, ranitidine 150 mg po daily, 1 tablet fish oil daily, and 1 tablet of vitamin d daily. he has no known drug allergies.physical examination:  nick looks well.  he is in no distress. weight is 221 lbs.  blood pressure is 150/80 in the right arm repeated over 3 manual measurements with a large manual cuff and his heart rate is 70 and regular.  his head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure, normal carotid upstroke and contour with no bruits.  his chest is clear to auscultation.  his cardiovascular exam demonstrated normal left apex and normal first and second heart sounds with a normal splitting of the second heart sound with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  he had no peripheral edema.  his abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  he had 2+ pulses in the peripheral exam.ekg today demonstrated sinus rhythm at 88 bpm with voltage criteria for lvh, lae and prior inferior q-waves.we are awaiting an updated lipid profile due this week before modifying his lipid therapy which is aimed to target a goal of less than 70 mg/dl.  he has tried and failed a trial of niacin in the past due to intolerable flushing and headache.  his ldl last year was 98 mg/dl though hdl has improved to 37 mg/dl. his tc/hdl ratio is 4.2, his tc is 155 mg/dl, and tg 101 mg/dl.  hba1c is 7.2%.the previous echo in 2096 demonstrated normal lv size and function with a normal lv ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no signs of lvh.impression:  nick is doing well with ccs 1 symptoms after repeated mis most recently in 2095 due to accelerated coronary atheroclerosis and radiation stenoses.  to target his coronary risk factors, i recommended the following:1.  should his ldl be &gt;70mg/dl he should switch to rosuvastatin 40mg daily for ldl and hdl improvement.2.  given clopidorel platelet reactivity is less than 230 pru he will decrease to 75 mg daily and we will re-check his pru activity after at least 7 days on this dose.  should pru &gt; 230 he will either need to restart 150 mg daily and take a ppi like pantoprazole or switch to prasugrel (or when available ticagrelor).3.  he will continue a healthy heart diet and exercise and we will see him again in 6 months.thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.  as i am not continuing a general out-patient clinic next year, nick will transition to another cardiologist who can accomodate his day off from work which is typically on saturday.  the patient was discussed in clinic with dr. neale xiao who agreed with this plan.yours sincerely,______________________________dictated by: yisroel f cooley, md mph frcpcemail: yfcooley@wsh.org
