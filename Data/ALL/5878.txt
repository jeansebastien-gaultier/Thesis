po tid .condition on discharge :stable .history of present illness :pauci may is a sixty three year old patient referred by dr. laymie aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .he developed acute pulmonary edema on may 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to sonpathcermu jords hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .he denied any angina .he had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .his pulmonary function tests showed fev1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .an echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .he was discharged home but readmitted on may 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .a thallium stress test showed equivocal st segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .his coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .he also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .on june 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .he was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .his ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .past medical history :as above .social history :he has a wife pandeprob and lives in ashing .he did smoke up to three pack per day .he has three children .he is retired .physical examination :six foot , 250 pounds .he is a well appearing male , in no distress .his blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .his neck veins were not distended .his carotids showed bilateral bruits .his lungs are clear .his cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .his abdomen is obese , but benign .his peripheral pulses are intact .he has no peripheral edema .his neurological exam is nonfocal .laboratory data :sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , co2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , bun 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , sgot 20 , and his digoxin level was 1.0 .hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , mcv 86 , pt and ptt were normal .urinalysis was unremarkable .his chest x-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .his electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .there were nonspecific st and t wave changes .hospital course :the patient was admitted to hellworthston hospital .there , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by cardiology and anesthesiology .there was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .on june 24 , 1993 , dr. lenni breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .he placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .he weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .he had no hemodynamic difficulties .he was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .he did revert back to atrial fibrillation .he was extubated within forty eight hours .he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit on june 26 .he reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required digoxin , and verapamil to control .he could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of quinaglute .he also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service .he was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .he was treated with digoxin and diuretics along with ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .he was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .it was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .he will be followed closely in 23 hwy , hamp by dr. laymie aslinke .may a , m.d.tr :ot / bmotdd :7/1/93td :07/02/93cc :dr. daizsmaellille dr. lenni breutzoln , reos 0
