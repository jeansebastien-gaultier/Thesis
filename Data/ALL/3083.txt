60 year old , spanishspeaking woman with multiple cardiacrisk factors who presented complaining of unstable chest pain. thepatient's cardiac risk factors include adult onset diabetes ,hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , a positive family history ,previous history of smoking as well as postmenopausal statesecondary to hysterectomy 21 years ago and not on estrogenreplacement therapy. the patient

occasionally notediaphoresis. she denies any nausea or vomiting or palpitations.in july of 1994 the patient underwent an echocardiogram whichshowed a left atrial size of 4.0 cm and ejection fraction ofapproximately 60% with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mildtricuspid regurgitation. since this time she has been followed bydr. maximo bryum in c&o medical center clinic who initiated an antianginal regimenwhich resulted in decreased frequency of her symptoms. of note thepatient recently stopped taking aspirin. her symptoms thenrecurred. on the 27 of january , 1995 the patient underwent adobutamine mibbe on which she went 6 minutes and 48 secondsreaching a maximal heart rate of 154 , a blood pressure of 172/82.the test showed 2 mm st depressions diffusely. the mibbe showedmoderate to severe reversible anterior and anteroseptal wallischemia. of note , on the morning of admission the patient wasseen by her vna. during her vna's visit the patient began to haveher typical anginal symptoms with radiation to her arms and jaw aswell as shortness of breath. she denied any diaphoresis or nausea.the patient was given three sublingual nitroglycerins after herprimary m.d. was called and her pain resolved after approximately15 minutes. past medical history: remarkable for a 10 yearhistory of insulin dependent diabetes with complications includingneuropathy and retinopathy. chronic atrial fibrillation included anormal tsh. hypertension. degenerative joint disease.gastroesophageal reflux. status post hysterectomy approximately 21years ago. medications on admission: atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d. ,axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.which the patient recently stopped , coumadin 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. ,diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d. ,

no known drug allergies.physical examination: her heart rate was 58 , blood pressure141/73 , o-2 saturation 97% on 2 liters ,respiratory rate 16 and unlabored. heent exam showed pupils equalround and reactive to light. extraocular movements were intact.oropharynx was clear. mucous membranes were moist. neck wassupple with full range of motion. jugular venous pressure wasdifficult to assess secondary to increased soft tissue around theneck. carotids were 2+ and without bruits. cardiac exam showed anirregularly irregular rate and rhythm , a normal s-1 and s-2 , a i/visystolic ejection murmur noted at the left upper sternal border.lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion. abdomen was soft ,nontender , obese with active bowel sounds. extremities showed aright shin scar which was healing well. there was no clubbing orcyanosis , no evidence of any femoral bruits. rectal examinationwas guaiac negative. on neurologic examination the patient wasalert and oriented x 2. cranial nerves ii-xii were intact.strength was 5/5 bilaterally. there was decreased sensation tolight touch bilaterally in the lower extremities.laboratory data: on admission sodium 134 , potassium 4.7 , chloride96 , bicarb 22 , bun 28 , creatinine 1.3 , bloodglucose 472 , digoxin level 1.0. pt 14.5 , ptt 26. urinalysis wasnegative. ekg showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 with anormal axis. t wave inversions were noted in both leads 3 and fand q waves were noted in v-1 through v-3. chest x-ray showed noevidence of infiltrates or effusions. there was borderlinecardiomegaly.hospital course: the patient was admitted to medicine team voone parkway , ainggo ra i , alaska 89772she was ruled out for myocardial infarction withserial ck , mb and ekg's. heparin was initially started given thepossibility that this was unstable angina. the cardiology team wasconsulted for recommendations on possible cardiac catheterization.on further review of her history the cardiology team decided toschedule a cardiac catheterization. this was performed on the 4 of june and showed mildly elevated right sided pressure including aright atrial pressure of 15 , an rv pressure of 50/16 with a mean papressure of 32 , pulmonary capillary wedge of 22. the coronaryarteries were noted to be normal and left ventricular function wasalso assessed as normal. the patient tolerated this procedure welland without complications. given the confluence of her data , twopossible explanations were postulated including either syndrome xor small vessel disease , not noted on cardiac catheterization. thepatient remained stable , status post cardiac catheterization andwas prepared for discharge. also during her hospital course thepatient's insulin dosages were adjusted in the manner to keep herblood sugars in the approximately 200 range.disposition: medications on discharge: enteric coated aspirin 325mg p.o. q.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; lopid 600 mgp.o. q.d.; insulin nph 100 units sub-q q.a.m. , 70 units
