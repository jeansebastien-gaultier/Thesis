failure .electrocardiogram :showed normal sinus rhythm at 107 beats per minute with left axis deviation and poor r-wave progression .however , no acute changes were apparent .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the cardiac medicine service and treated for presumed diastolic and systolic dysfunction .echocardiogram was obtained which showed moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function as well as hypokinesis of the lower half of septum and apex .also of note was the distal lateral wall hypokinesis .the wall motion abnormalities were noted to be new .it was believed that a troponin on admission in addition to the wall motion abnormalities she underwent a non-q wave myocardial infarction prior to resulted in her current cardiac failure .throughout hospital course

optimal .on 05-25 she underwent catheterization and subsequent stenting of the left renal artery .due to dye load required to assess the coronary disease were not visualized .after the procedure the

heart failure and cardiology in one week as well .in addition , patient is to have her own appointment with podiatry .discharge medications :1. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day .2. norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day
