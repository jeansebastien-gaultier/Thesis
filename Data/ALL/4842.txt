insufficiency who now presents with syncopal episode.		hpi:  ms rivers was in her usoh until the morning of admission, when she went into the city to buy some buttons and pay a bill at viewsonic.  she noted that she was not feeling well throughout the morning, and she felt as if she may need to eat something.  however, because she did not have her insulin and blood sugar monitoring equipment, she decided not to eat.  she continued to feel poorly (she is somewhat vague on symptoms but reports feeling that her chest was congested and that she may have had some palpitations and felt chilled).  she saw a police cruiser, and walked over to it with the intention of getting help.  when she arrived, there was no one in the car, and she leaned forward to rest her head on the front of the car.  this is the last thing she remembered; when she awoke, she was surrounded by people.  she was told that she had falled backwards and hit the back of her head.  when ems found her, she was confused, making repetitive statements, and stating that she had pain in her occiput that radiated down her neck.  when she arrived at the fmh ed, her blood pressure was 213/97 hr 84 rr20 o2 sat 99% ra temp 97.3.  she received labetolol 20 iv, toradol 30 mg iv, asa 325 mg and tylenol 1000 mg po x 1.  her mental status cleared somewhat, and her blood pressure came down to 130s/80s.  she did have one episode of emesis, during which her hr was noted to transiently dip to the 40s (not captured on the monitor); spontaneously recovered to the 60s.she had a c-spine series and head ct which were negative for acute process, and a cxr which was negative except for r shoulder not well-visualized on cxr.  she was noted to have some superficial bleeding of her posterior scalp, but no obvious laceration.  she was admitted to the sdu because of the episode of bradycardia.pmh/psh -diabetes type i (by her report) followed at hometown medical-sjogren's disease, followed by dr vidal at
