hct 25-27.hemolysis work-up was negative.  acute drop in hct was thoughtto be from gi source.  pt's hct bumped appropriately with 2u rbctransfusions, and she was monitored for 1 day in micu, where sheremained hemodynamically stable.  gi was consulted, and givenher family's desire for minimal intervention, she was managedconservatively with ppi, hct checks, and prn transfusions.  shewas also taken off asa ppx for stroke, in setting of gib.although labs do not show iron deficiency, she was supplementedas she may continue to have gib.  her hct remained stable at ~25on day of discharge.  she should have her hematocrit checked onthe day after discharge.  her hematocrit should be regularlymonitored afterwards according to her attending doctor'sdiscretion, but we would advise that another hematocrit bechecked this [last name (lf) 2974], [10-2], and that she be transfusedas needed to keep her hct at baseline ~ 25.# hypernatremia:  pt arrived with sodium of 153, which wasthought to be
