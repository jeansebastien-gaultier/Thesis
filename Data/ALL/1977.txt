downhis left arm. however , the pain was different from the pressure he hadfelt from his previous admissions that were positive for stenosis. painwas described as sharp 9/10 that improved after taking his second dose ofntg. the diaphoresis and arm symptoms resolved concurrently with thechest pain. he received a third dose of ntg from the ems and brought toed.of note , one week ago patient was struck in the center of his chest byteenagers "horsing around" next to him. the impact was severe enough tocause him to fall to the ground. he noticed pain around the region forthe next several days

pain free but began to experiencenausea and vomiting which was relieved by ntg and then with a dose ofcompazine. it was unclear if the nausea was related to ischemia or thedose of dilaudid he received in the ed. however there were no ecgchanges during his nausea. altogether the nausea lasted forapproximately 10 minutes. he remained pain free during the night withwhat he described as some slight pressure over his chest. his chest istender at baseline ever since his cabg and it was difficult to assesswhether the pain was msk or cardiac in nature. he sometimes felt it wasdifferent from when he first presented with an mi , and at other times hedescribes the pain as being related to movement and to the kick to thechest that he received 2 weeks earlier ( see hpi ). overnight on hd#1patient did not require any more ntg doses , remained hemodynamicallystable , and three sets of enzymes were negative for mi. pt had severaladmissions in the past where he presented with chest pain and underwentcatheterizations , some of which revealed restenosis and some of whichwere negative. given his presentation was very atypical it was decided todo a stress pet the next day to assess ischemia and then re-evaluateplan. he was kept on his home regimen of cardiac medications in additionto lovenox 100 mg sc for acs. on hd#2 when moving from his chair to thebed he began to complain of 2/10 chest pressure that he says felt alittle different than the pain when palpating his chest. again therewere no ecg changes. he underwent a stress pet which was negative forischemia. given his presentation with a clearly negative study it wasmost likely that his symptoms were msk in origin.2 ) dm2patient's home regimen of oral hypoglycemic agents were held and he wastreated with basal
