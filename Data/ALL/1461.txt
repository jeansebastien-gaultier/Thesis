.electroencephalogram :normal study .visual field testing :small wedge-shaped visual field defect in right eye , suggesting retinal lesion .echocardiogram revealing segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving inferoseptal , inferior and posterior segments at the base and mid ventricular level .overall left ventricle systolic function moderately impaired with and estimated ejection

course :the patient was admitted with a right occipital cerebral infarction .the patient was started on intravenous heparin and had the studies as described above for rule out source of embolic strokes including carotid noninvasives , transcranial dopplers , holter electrocardiogram and echocardiogram .the patient also had serial electrocardiogram , which showed no change .the patient also had serial creatinine kinase with mb fractions studied , which revealed mb fraction too low to be tested .the patient also experienced a feeling of moving back and forth when lying down with neck extended during the magnetic resonance imaging study and also in bed .this moving sense , with normal electroencephalogram , was thought to be a mild vestibular dysfunction or from the acute episode of the stroke .the patient will have these symptoms only when the eyes are closed .our opinion was not to intervene or have any further studies for acute period and to continued to observe .the patient did have a hypotensive episode and the systolic blood pressure was 80 , after the patient received his regular cardiac medications .the patient had been off his regular medications since during the admission and will be discharged off his medications .otherwise , there were no further episodes of blurred vision .the patient was stable with an unchanged neurological and physical examination and was discharged on aspirin 325 mg po qd , on may 14 , 1995 .the patient will be randomized on the wars study early next week by the stroke service at ph university of medical center .condition on discharge :the patient was stable with the physical examination as described above .discharge orders :medications - aspirin 325 mg po qd , glipizide 25 mg po qd .the patient will be discharged home without his regular cardiac medications .the patient will be followed by dr. ketyvi liftjesc of the neurology service at ph university of medical center on may 17 , 1995 , for randomization on the wars study .the patient will be also followed by dr. joseet gelineau of the neurology service at ph university of medical center .the patient will also be followed by dr. margmimaui gelineau , his primary care physician at ochtuheihugh put university medical center within one week after discharge .the patient will also be followed by his regular urologist at
