( 3 ) insulin dependentdiabetes mellitus diagnosed in 1980. ( 4 ) cerebrovascular accident1997 with residual right lower extremity motor debilitation andword finding. ( 5 ) p32 , calcium 45 , carbon 14 exposure at work.social history: the patient is a microbiologist at ford , works on virus in vandmi ave , co , new york 88983 harbor andlives in delpa he has a tobacco history significant for 35pack years of pipe and cigarette smoking. he has no significantalcohol history.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 98.2 , heart rate66 , blood pressure 144/84 , 96% o2 sat onroom air. neck: jvp was at 8 cm , carotids 2+ bilaterally withoutbruit and no lymphadenopathy. heart: regular rate and rhythm witha loud p2 at the left upper sternal border and s4. lungs: clearto auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. abdomen:obese , nontender , nondistended with normal abdominal bowel soundsand a palpable liver margin. right rib cage nontender.extremities: demonstrated 1+ bilateral pitting edema with palpablepulses bilaterally , they were cool.laboratory evaluation: normal electrolytes with serum creatinineof 0.8. white blood count 9.7. hematocrit32.2. platelets 225. serial ck's were obtained and were 35 , 36 ,and 31. dedimer was 411. troponin i was 0.01. electrocardiogramdemonstrated atrial flutter with a 4 to 1 block at 65 beats perminute without st-t wave changes. he ambulated times four minuswith a d sat from 95% to 90 to 92 %.hospital course: this 66 year-old male with coronary disease ,status post coronary artery bypass graft with aninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus complained of excelleratingshortness of breath times six months with minimal exertion. aftera presentation with low intermediate pre-test probability forpulmonary embolus , we obtained a vq scan that was determiend to beintermediate probability. the patient was then referred for acoronary angiography. this was performed on 2/23 and revealedthree vessel native coronary disease and one occluded bypass graft.left anterior descending artery had a discrete mid 50 % stenosisoccluded distally. the ramus had a smooth discrete 80% stenosis.the left circumflex artery was totally occluded proximally. theright coronary artery was also totally occluded but in themidportion. of the graft , the left internal mammary artery to theleft anterior descending was patent. saphenous vein grafts to theramus was totally occluded at the tessio site. svg to the rightcoronary artery was patent. lower extremity noninvasive studieswere negative for deep venous thrombosis. the patient's dyspnea onexertion was deemed to be due to left ventricular diastolicdysfunction and the patient was discharged on appropriateanti-hypertensive and ischemic medical regimen for follow up withhis cardiologist , dr. gregg berlin on 5/29 in stable condition.medication at the time of discharge: aspirin 325 mg po q day ,atenolol 50 mg po q am , nphhumulin insulin 20 units qam , 4 units qhs subcutaneously , regularinsulin on a sliding scale , lisinopril 10 mg po qam , sublingualnitroglycerin as needed for chest pain q 5 minutes times 3 ,simvastatin 20 mg po qhs , micforman 1 gram po bid , plavix 75 mg poqam , lasix 20 mg po qam.dictated by: donn ulmen , m.d. aj79attending: winfred d. severns , m.d. qu24fl084/5833batch: 88885 index no. ynxp4a8ve9 d: 9/11t: 1/6
