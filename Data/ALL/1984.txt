admission date :10/23/1999discharge date :11/02/1999history of present illness :ms. breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a c-1 to c-2 dural avm in january , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .she was originally admitted to the verg medical center in january , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .she was found to have intermedullary lesion at c1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .the postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .as of the beginning of september , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .she is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .she has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .she denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .the patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .this pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .hospital course :on admission , a ct scan of the head with and without contrast was performed , showing a missing posterior arch at c-1 and metallic clips at the craniocervical junction consistent with prior surgical intervention .no arteriovenous malformations are identified ; there is no evidence of recurrence of her former vascular malformation .no intraspinal lesions are identified .upon further review of dr. laymie fields , department of neuroradiology , review of the cervical spine on ct reveals no extrinsic compressive lesions impacting the spinal cord and no enhancing lesions of the spinal cord with contrast .angiography performed on october 31 , 1999 , showed normal vascular distribution of the head and neck with no recurrence of arteriovenous malformation .during this admission , the patient was started on baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for spasticity .coumadin was discontinued .the patient was given aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.the patient was also given valium 5-10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for muscle spasm .she was continued on demerol 50 mg q 6-8 hours p.r.n. for left arm and leg pain .upon further review of ct and angiography results with neuroradiology and neurology service , it was decided that ct myelography was not indicated at this time .note , the patient is not a candidate for magnetic resonance imaging secondary to ferromagnetic intracardiac pacing device .
