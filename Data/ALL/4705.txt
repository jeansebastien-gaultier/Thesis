as a fixed inferiorwall defect consistent with a right coronary artery infarct. thepatient was diuresed , started on carvedilol and improved.troponins trended down. the patient continued to have frequentruns of ectopy and svt. the patient was placed on a heparin dripand transferred to the acbroadl hospital forcatheterization and possible percutaneous intervention. onadmission , the patient

expiratory phase.heart , s1 , s2 , prosthetic s2. no murmurs , gallops or rubsappreciated. abdomen soft , nontender and nondistended withpositive bowel sounds. extremities are without edema. dpintact. feet are cool but well perfused. skin warm , dry andintact , no rashes. the patient is alert and oriented x3.laboratory data: labs notable for creatinine of 1 , hematocrit of39.5 , platelets of 113 , cholesterol 157 , triglycerides 76 , hdl32 , ldl 110 , hemoglobin a1c 6.3 , tsh 1.9. ekg , sinus rhythm ,left bundle branch block with multiple pvcs , a widened qrs ofduration of 190 milliseconds. chest x-ray , cardiomegalyconsistent with mild interstitial edema.hospital course: in summary , this is a 64-year-old male with ahistory of coronary artery disease status post cabg and nstemi ,chf with a known ef of 15% , status post aortic valve replacement ,presenting through an outside hospital with chf exacerbationlikely secondary to ischemia.1. cardiovascular:ischemia: no evidence of ongoing ischemia on admission.elevated troponin at outside hospital trended down possiblysecondary to nstemi prior to admission versus demand. thepatient was continued on aspirin , plavix , beta-blocker and aceinhibitor , which were titrated to effect. the patient wasstarted on a statin and continued on niaspan , left heart cathrevealed occluded graft and 2+ aortic insufficiency with 100% ladstenosis , 70% diagonal 1 , 90% circumflex , 45% rca and 100%effused lima graft to circumflex and a 100% effused svg graft tolad. the patient is now status post stenting the om v1 and lad.the patient has remained asymptomatic and shortness of breath hasimproved.pump: ef 15% on repeat echo with severe mr. the patient wascontinued on spironolactone. the patient continued to bediuresed initially and is now euvolemic. he will need a repeatecho in three months to evaluate his ejection fraction anddetermine the utility of an aicd placement.rhythm: we held verapamil secondary to double av nodal blockade.however , with the patient's history of widened qrs and multiplepvcs and svt , the patient will follow up with ep to assess theutility of aicd.2. respiratory: the patient has no acute issues. shortness ofbreath has improved. continues to complain of residual shortnessof breath while lying flat on his left side.3. renal: creatinine has been stable at baseline. we willclosely follow status post chat. the patient was pretreated withbicarbonate and mucomyst. creatinine remained stable.4. gi: lfts are mildly increased likely secondary to rightheart failure.5. heme: the patient's hematocrit was 39 on admission. ittrended down status post cath likely secondary to blood lossgiven the long case and hemodilution; however , hematocrit fell to38 concerning for retroperitoneal bleed. despite patientremaining hemodynamically stable and groin without evidence ofhematoma , the patient underwent a ct scan , which was negative.his hematocrit was stabilized. he was not transfused , as he wasasymptomatic and recently revascularized. the patient was notedto be guaiac positive without evidence of gross bleeding , thuswill need outpatient follow-up and colonoscopy. the patientcontinues his heparin-bridged coumadin with a goal of inr 2 to 3.in addition , the patient suffers from long-termthrombocytopenia. his platelet count was 113 on admission.review of records revealed thrombocytopenia on previous admissionto norpid memorial hospital as well as on presentation to outside hospital priorto heparinization , thus low suspicion for hit. the patient'splatelet level remained stable. he should consider outpatientevaluation by hematology.6. endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes on oralhypoglycemics , which were discontinued on admission. the patientwas controlled with regular insulin and placed back on his oralhypoglycemics prior to discontinuing. a1c was within normallimits.7. id: no acute issues.8. psych:
