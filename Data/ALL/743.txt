( interestingly , her sister who had the myocardial infarction during cardiac catheterization also had an angiogram showing clear coronaries according to the patient ) .the patient was still awaiting her esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dr. gootzfrier .results were discussed with the patient and her ongoing therapy reviewed .in view of the catheterization results , the patient opted to discontinue her lipitor for now .discharge diagnosis :chest pain with reversible defect on recent exercise tolerance test adenosine mibi and normal coronary angiography .other diagnoses as in past medical history ( see discharge summary of 6/26 to 6/28/99 ) .medications on discharge :pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , premarin .9 milligrams po q d , prilosec 20 milligrams po b.i.d.
