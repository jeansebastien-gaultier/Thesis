admission date :4/17/95discharge date :07/16/95history and reason for admission :mr. mass was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from vassdiysey medical center for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .mr. mass had a past medical history which included wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .he was admitted to vassdiysey medical center with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .his amylase on admission there was 1,961 .the patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in january 1994 , and august 1994 .on his current admission , the patient was admitted to free medical center .his amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .at that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .he also became increasingly confused .a computerized tomography scan done on 4/16/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .he was transferred to ph university of medical center for further surgical evaluation .&apos;hospital course :the patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .he was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .on 4/17/95 , gi interventional radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .the drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .the patient was evaluated by cardiology .a persantine thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .an echocardiogram was done .the echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .the right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .the percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .the fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .on 4/28/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .his white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on 4/27 .a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .the computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on 4/28/95 .an exploratory laparotomy was performed .the splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .the patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .the patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the intensive care unit .in the intensive care unit , the patient had a prolonged course .the patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .he remained on imipenem , and vancomycin was also started .thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .he was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .he had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .these resolved without incident .he also had repeated temperature spikes .after repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .his drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .mr. mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .most recently , he was on a 28 day course of vancomycin , ofloxacin , and flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .this 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .the patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-b and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew candida albicans .the patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .he was treated with amphotericin-b bladder washes for this .mr. mass was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .he remained stable from a cardiac fashion .he did have problems with po intake .he had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .he was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently granisetron , with only mild success .he remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .by the end of june , it became clear that mr. mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .the patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .multiple discussions were held between dr. mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .after discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , dr. douet at vassdiysey medical center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to vassdiysey medical center .of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .
