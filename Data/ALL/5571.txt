medical visit with this75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.  history of present illness:  she has a long history ofsevere cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.  shehas stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. past right carotid endarterectomy.  in august 2095, she was admitted to bmh with a rightcerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation andpneumonia.  she underwent stenting of her right vertebralartery and left common carotid artery.  she had subsequentepisodes of worsening speech, and was started on coumadin,with an inr goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  she is followed closely byneurology and may, at some point, undergo furtherinterventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  during her most recent hospitalization she had someconfusion which was attributed to low sodium.  this wasfelt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possiblesiadh.  this is being treated with salt tablets, salineboluses in her g-tube, water restriction, and low-doselasix.  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss. baseline weight 170 pounds.  weight in early september, 167pounds.  weight october 20th, 160 pounds.  weight <phi type="date">november 28th</phi>, 141 pounds.  weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  she had a swallowing study on october 26, 2095, whichrevealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  theg-tube was placed in august, and has healed well, but hasnever been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis. over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening troublewith coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts toswallow.  her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has beenquite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureedfoods here and there.  she is drinking two or three can ofbooster ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloricneeds.  today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter(phone number 507.741.8042).  most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: sodium 137,potassium 4.8, chloride 95, bicarb 32, bun 22, creatinine1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  the patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, asher weight has decreased.  review of systems:  also remarkable for slight bright redblood per rectum within the last week.  the patient'sdaughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy inearly 2095, at the richwood area community hospital.  thepatient's daughter will bring me these records at the nextvisit. past medical history:1. cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 2. throat cancer in early 2060s.  status post xrt to theneck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid andvertebral disease).3. breast cancer.  details unknown.  will review at nextvisit. 4. diabetes, type ii.  on glyburide.  further detailsunknown. 5. siadh.  will review hospital chart in detail. 6. hypertension.  per neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to170.  7. hypothyroidism.  details unknown.  recent tsh normal.  8. glaucoma. 9. anxiety.  being followed by psychiatry on an activebasis.  this was apparently a large factor during her recenthospitalizations.  10. possible

prn19. fleet enema prn20. tylenol 650 mg p.o. prnallergies:  no known drug allergies.  social history:  the patient has four children.  herdaughter fitzpatrick is a food service supervisor.  another daughter is staying with thepatient full-time.  visiting nurse is involved.  previous tothe last few months, the patient was fairly independent. physical examination:  general:  cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteadyon her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowlyand carefully.  has a cane, but does not always use it.  vital signs:  bp 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),and 171/74 on repeat.  pulse 80.  weight 146.5 pounds, fullyclothed.  abdomen:  with good bowel sounds.  soft, nontender andnondistended.  no hepatosplenomegaly.  no masses.  g-tube isflushed with water, and flushes easily.  g-tube site itselfis well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.  lungs:  clear to auscultation.  heart:  regular rate and rhythm.  no murmurs.  assessment and plan: 1. weight loss.  probably due to poor caloric intake.  thisis a significant health concern for her, as she has becomeprogressively cachectic and weak.  this is probablyattributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. she is referred urgently to nutrition, and will see them ontuesday.  i suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionistthat we transition her to tube feeds for at least a coupleof weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. she should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but sheneeds to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the g-tube,since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.  will try glucernabecause of her diabetes history.  the patient's daughter andthe nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin k andcoumadin, and they will discuss this further when she seesnutrition clinic in two days.  2. cerebrovascular disease.  followed closely by neurology. no acute change in neuro status today.  will continuecoumadin.  being followed closely by internal medicine forthis.  recent inr 1.4.  will adjust coumadin as advised byim nurse.  3. siadh.  i need to review these records more closely, andtry to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.  inthe meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. 4. diabetes.  recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300to 350 range.  most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200range over the past few days.  continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.b.i.d.  finger-sticks three to four times daily.  furtheradjustments prn.  our current goal is simply to maintain hersugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.  once herdietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightlytighter control.  wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given hertroubles with p.o. intake.    5. recent history of bright red blood per rectum.  daughterwill bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we willtake it from there. 6. constipation.  continue colace.  add dulcolax prn. continue fleet enema prn by visiting nurse.  if she doeshave chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite andher ability to eat successfully.  7. hypertension.  currently in reasonable control.  goal bp140 to 170, systolic.  initial severe hypertension thisvisit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issuefor her.  follow-up at next visit. 8. anxiety.  followed by psychiatry.  extensive reassurancegiven today to the patient.  she is very concerned about herweight loss, as am i.  i tried to reassure her that we wouldtake this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion. addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qdwatch for worsening siadh and/or anthicholinergic side effects.9. multiple other issues.  to be addressed at furthervisits.  given her weight loss and complexity, i will seeher on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner prn. daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.______________________________julia yale, m.d.cc:escription
