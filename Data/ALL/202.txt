cavernous hemangiomas .she is right-handed .she was in her usual state of health until one and a half weeks prior to admission .she developed an ear ache , for which she saw her primary care physician , evelyn was prescribed cortisone drops .a few days later she complained of dizziness .this was mostly described as feeling unsteady on her feet .she stated that she had trouble knowing if her feet were touching the ground .she was seen again by primary care physician , roderick since she had complaints of dizziness , as well as a new complaint of decreased hearing and the sensation of static in her ears , meniere 's disease was considered .she was given an oral prednisone taper .this unsteady gait progressed , and then she subsequently started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the face , hands and feet bilaterally .her hearing got progressively worse and the sound of static increased .she was very fatigued .at an outside hospital , head ct revealed a 1.5 cm diameter hyperdense mass in the pons , slightly off center to the right .she was transferred here for further care .past medical history :notable for multiple cavernous hemangiomas .she has had at least two bleeding episodes in the past , mostly described as being accompanied by generalized weakness .she has had at least two generalized seizures in the past , but she has not had one since she was 26 years old .she was never on an anticonvulsant due to her former beliefs as n. derk scientist .she no longer observes that belief system .medications :prednisone taper as above .allergies :none .family history :strong maternal history of hemangiomas .physical examination :temperature 99.2 .pulse 60 .blood pressure 120/80 .respiratory rate 14 .in general , she was a thin well-appearing woman in no acute distress .sclera were anicteric .neck was supple .chest was clear .cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .abdomen soft , nontender and distended .extremities showed no edema .neurologically , she was awoken from sleep by voice , cooperative , but mildly drowsy .she became more alert during the remainder of the exam .speech was fluent but slow , and there was long response latencies before she would initiate speech .she otherwise had normal spontaneous movements and facial expression and did not appear to be abulic .she had normal comprehension .she was able to give a detailed history in an organized manner .there was no dysarthria .language was normal .there was no evidence of any special neglect .pupils equal , round and reactive to light .visual fields were full .extraocular movements were full with normal smooth pursuit to the left .pursuit was interrupted by >.....< when tracking from left to right .she had sustained gaze holding nystagmus in both horizontal directions .there was no rotary component .she had a mildly widened right palpable fissure .there was decreased excursion of the right mouth and flattening of the right nasolabial fold ( mild ) .light touch was subjectively abnormal on both sides of the face .hearing was diminished for conversational speech .palate and tongue moved normally in the midline .there was a mild left pronator drift .finger tapping and rapid alternating movements were slow on the left and she had trouble isolating individual finger movements .there was mild finger-to-nose dysmetria on the left .power was mildly diminished in the finger extensors and hand intrinsics on the left , otherwise , power was full throughout .reflexes were brisk in the legs with 4-5 beats of clonus at the ankles bilaterally .she had bilateral upgoing toes .she made mistakes with position sense , roughly at chance level with both great toes and the left first finger , position sense in the right limb seems preserved .gait was wide based , very unsteady , veering to the left and to the right .she retropulsed and would have pitched backwards without the assistance of the examiner .laboratories :white blood cell count 7.8 with 86% polymorphonuclear cells , 11.1 lymphocytes , hemoglobin 14.3 , hematocrit 40.5 , mcv 88 , inr 1.0 , ptt 24.7 , pt 12.3 , platelet count 295,000 , glucose 81 , bun 15 , creatinine 0.8 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 104 , co2 26 , calcium 9.3 , phosphate 4.8 , magnesium 2.3 .mri of the brain revealed multiple foci susceptibility artifact within the brain .these were seen best in gradient echocardiogram images .there was a large focus of subacute blood products in the mid to low pons suggesting recent hemorrhage into a cavernous angioma .there was some mild surrounding edema .there are also tiny foci artifact within the cerebellum and base of the pons .there was a larger area of susceptibility artifact in the left temporal lobe , right frontal lobe , and the splenius of the corpus collasum .the brain parenchyma was otherwise normal .there was mild enhancement of the pontine hemorrhagic mass but none elsewhere .there was no areas of restricted diffusion to indicate infarction .mra of the brain was unremarkable .there was no communication >.......< in the visualized vessels and the angiomas .follow-up ct was obtained the second day of admission .there was no evidence of developing hydrocephalus , which was a concern due to the surrounding edema , and possible suppression of the fourth ventricle .there was no significant change in size of the subacute pontine hemorrhage .hospital course :mrs. wisniewski is a 45 - year-old woman with a strong family history of cavernous angiomas .she has had several prior bleeding events and presented with a subacute bleed in the mid to lower pons .there was relatively central in location , with only a slight right-sided predominance .her physical examination remained relatively unchanged , with resolution of the subtle left hand weakness and right facial weakness .her gait remained severely ataxic , likely secondary to sensory deafferentation , as well as involvement of crossing pontine cerebellar fibers .therefore , it was recommended that she have aggressive physical therapy at an acute rehabilitation center .the case was discussed with dr. harold from the falmouth hospital .he has followed this family in the past and will see her in follow-up .we will arrange to have a copy of the mri scans sent to him .discharge diagnoses :1. familial cavernous hemangiomas , status post a subacute pontine hemorrhage .2. severe gait ataxia .discharge medications :1. gabapentin 100 mg po t.i.d. for paresthesias .2. colace 100 mg po b.i.d.3. zantac 150 mg po b.i.d.4. prednisone taper completed .andre r. ratan , m.d.23-397dictated by : maria a singler , m.d.medquist36d : 2009-12-31 14:05t : 2009-12-31 14:57job #: 71678signed electronically by : dr. juan r. ratan on : tue
