[female first name (un) 899] cant see [2-8]graft. no post-ischemic changes. free fluid in abdomen andanasarca, all unchanged. no change from prior.brief hospital course:in brief, the patient is an 88 year old man with severe ischemiccardiomyopathy s/p biv-icd placement, atrial flutter, cad,chronic kidney disease who presented with hypoxic respiratoryfailure and shock which was stablized.  his course was furthercomplicated by acute abdomial pain, psoas muscle hematoma, uppergi bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, heparin inducedthrombocytopenia with upper extremity dvt, intermittent hypoxia,and urinary retention..1) shock - patient intially presented in shock requiringvasopressors.  cardiac index was normal with decreased svr whichwere not consistent with cardiogenic shock. the likely cause ofwas distributive/septic shock of unclear source of infection.he completed a full course of empiric antibiotics.  he completed7 days of hydrocortisone/fludrocort for sub-optimal response toacth.  bp stablized by time of discharge..2) respiratory failure: the patient initially presented inhypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to chf,hypoventilation and decreased mental status.  he was intubatedprior to transfer to [hospital1 18].  he was weaned from the ventilatorsuccessfully.  he did have intermittent hypoxia largelysecondary to pulmonary edema from inadequate diuresis.  he wasstabilized on standing twice daily lasix. he was started onbipap at night for hypoventilation..3) abdominal pain - during the hospital stay he developed acutesevere epigastric pain.  he was transfered to the micu forconcern for mesenteric ischemia.  an abominal cta was negativefor this.  a surgery consult was obtained and recommended nosurgical intervention.  the pain resolved without specificintervention. he was subsequently found to have an psoas musclehematoma and required several blood transfusions withappropriate response in his hematocrit.4) cardiovascular:a. cad- history of mi s/p cabg. will continue asa, simvastatin,beta-blocker..b. pump- severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with ef 10-15% s/pbiv-icd placement. no evidence of cardiogenic shock upon initialpresenation as c.i. was normal.  medically managed chf withacei, beta-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide..c. rhythm- [hospital1 ]-v paced with underlying rhythm is atrialflutter/fibrillation. started on amiodarone for maintenance ofsinus rhythm to maximize likelihood of atrial kick. also,amiodarone to decrease in-appropriate shocks from icd.5) upper gi bleed - the patient did develop guaiac positivestools in the setting of anticoagulation for the atrialfibrillation. the hematocrit drop was largely due to the psoashematoma as above.  the patient refused egd.  if the patientdevelops recurrent melenotic stools he could be referred to gifor endoscopy.  he will continue on a ppi..6)acute on chronic renal failure - initial creatinine down fromadmission to peak 2.5 this was likely from pre-renal secondaryto shock state; no evidence of atn. by time of discharge, thecreatinine had resolved to baseline..7) anemia-  in addition the the acute blood loss anemia asdescribed above.  the patient has a chronic microcytic anemia.iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease(labs drawn before blood transfusions were given).  also withregard to the significant microcytosis and his italianextraction, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed to evaluatefor thallasemia.  these results were pending at time ofdischarge..8) thrombocytopenia - hit type ii. pf4 positive on [2120-12-27],platelets stable at around 70k with subsequent recovery togreater than 150k. he did have a left upper extremity venousclot although the developement of this was after his plateletshad stabilized.  started argatroban on [2120-12-27] with transitionto coumadin.  he continued on argatroban until his inr oncombined anti-coagulation was >4. at which time he wasmaintained on coumadin alone..9) urinary retention: - the patient has no prior history ofurinary retention, nocturia, frequency or related bph symptoms.during one attempt at removing the foley catheter he haddecreased urine output with a large volume detected on bladderscan.  the foley was replaced.  he was started on finasteride,not wanting to use an alpha-blocker that would likely causehypotension when added to his extensive cardiac regimen.  thecatheter was left in at discharge.  this should be removed in[2-9] days followed by confirmation that the patient can urinate..10) code status: dnr/dni confirmed with patient and hcp..11) dispo: the patient was discharged to rehabmedications on admission:hydrocortisone na 50 mg iv q6rissipratropium mdi prntylenol prnalbuterol prnlactulose 30 mg po q8 prnpantoprazole 40 mg po q24 hramiodarone 200 mg po qdayasa 81 mg po qdaycolace 100 mg [hospital1 ]senna [hospital1 ]fludrocortisone 0.05 mg po qdaysimvastatin 40 mg po qdayheparin gttzosyn 2.25 mg iv q6discharge medications:1. simvastatin 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).2. amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).3. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q4-6h (every4 to 6 hours) as needed.4. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day).5. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday).6. lactulose 10 g/15 ml syrup sig: thirty (30) ml po q8h (every8 hours) as needed: to maintain at least 1bm per day.7. digoxin 125 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po every other day(every other day).8. metoprolol succinate 25 mg tablet sustained release 24hr sig:one (1) tablet sustained release 24hr po daily (daily).9. trazodone 50 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po hs (at bedtime) asneeded for sleep.10. aspirin 81 mg tablet, chewable sig: one (1) tablet, chewablepo daily (daily).11. spironolactone 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).12. lisinopril 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily): hold for sbp <95.13. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) nebinhalation q4h (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezing, dyspnea.14. furosemide 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 timesa day).15. warfarin 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime:titrate to inr goal [2-9].16. finasteride 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).17. compazine 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po every eight (8)hours as needed for nausea.18. outpatient lab workplease draw pt/inr daily for 3 days and thereafter per protocolfor inr goal [2-9]19. aluminum-magnesium hydroxide 225-200 mg/5 ml suspension sig:15-30 mls po qid (4 times a day) as needed.20. bipapbipap with mask at night 10cmh2o ps, 5 cmh2o peep. titrate fio2to keep o2sat >95%discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital1 700] - [location (un) 701]discharge diagnosis:primary:septic shockhypoxic respiratory failuresecondary:heparin induced thrombocytopeniaacute blood loss anemia from psoas muscle hematomaurinary retentionupper extremity venous clotischemic cardiomyopathyatrial fibrillation/ atrial fluttercongestive heart failure - systolic, compensatedmicrocytic anemiadischarge condition:good. stable vital signs. tolerating oral medications andnutrition. ambulating with minimal assist.discharge instructions:you have been evaluated for respiratory distress, and very lowblood blood pressure.  these resolved with time, antibiotics,and close management of your chronic heart disease.  your coursewas complicated by a bleed into a hip muscle, a reaction to amedication called heparin, and difficulty urinating.  these wereall stablized over the course of the hospital stay.please take the medications as prescribed.please make and attend your recommended follow-up appointments.if you develop any concerning symptom particularly chest pain,shortness of breath, bloody or tarry stools please seek medicalattention.followup instructions:please contact your primary doctor dr.
