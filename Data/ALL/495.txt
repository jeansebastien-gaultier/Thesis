prednisone 8 mg. a day.  azathioprine 250 mg. a day; axid 150 mg. twice a day; cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; cardura 4 mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.   review of systems:  has had one fracture of his right ring finger that was from a trauma some years ago.  other past medical history includes history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.   rachael g. obryan, m.d. vallejo general hospitalendocrinology division                        workman, edwin179 lunar lane                           61248040brookshire, mo  15345                             4-12-84page 2  family history:  his sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral collapses and some nerve damage.  his father and mother have had diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  there is a 19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  there is no history of thyroid disease in the family. social history:  he currently works at belkin and has a desk job there.  he quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  he has been married for over 20 years.  his review of symptoms revealed the absence of gi symptoms.  there were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  normal sexual function.  he denied any skin problems or rashes.  he denied numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  there is a history of hypertension.   other review of systems:  his height has been stable at 6'2" tall.   physical examination:  blood pressure 130/93.  heart rate 96.   the patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  his height is 6'2".  weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  he has a mild cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical and supraclavicular fat.  retina appeared without lesions.  normal extra-ocular movements.  his oral mucosa was moist without evidence of thrush.  neck exam:  he had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  normal thyroid.   his chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal excretion.  there was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  his cardiac exam:  he had a soft, s1, s2.  cardiac exam otherwise unremarkable.  his abdomen was soft.  he had some evidence of insulin injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  he injects both in his abdomen and rotates with his arms.  his extremities revealed minimal stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  no edema.  neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  he had normal to slightly decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.   laboratory exam:  most recent laboratories that i could find were february 09, 2084.  sodium 141.  k 5.1; chloride 105.  bicarb 20.  bun 39.  creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  his ck was 219.  calcium 9.7.  albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  alkaline phosphatase was 90.  uric acid 5.1; magnesium 1.9.  tsh was 1.6.  cholesterol 242.  triglycerides 226.  his cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  his cbc revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a normal differential.   assessment and plan:  this is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple medical problems.  the one's most pertinent to us currently are rachael g. obryan, m.d. vallejo general hospitalendocrinology division                        workman, edwin007 lunar lane                           61248040brookshire, mo  15345                             4-12-84page 3  the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of osteoporosis.  the total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  the patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant patients.  however, getting a bone density study in the patient like this makes sense.  we will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling reasons.  we will also check vitamin d levels given patient's history of renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to do for him is to give him vitamin d.  his calcium intake was estimated to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  we would be a little reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, without more information about this patient.  the patient's diabetes seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we don't have access to hemoglobin a1c.  given the fact that it sounds like he has got pretty good care by dr. paz, we will not pursue this at the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone situation.  otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to rachael g. obryan, m.d. vallejo general hospitalendocrinology division                        workman, edwin315 lunar lane                           61248040brookshire, mo  15345                             4-12-84page 4  the patient after we get a bone density and decide when he next needs to be seen.     ______________________________rachael obryan, m.d.    ______________________________edwin foss, m.d.  cc:  nicodemus paz, m.d.      queenstown, wi      kevin kenyon, m.d.      cardiology     vallejo general hospital     49 pheasant lane     brookshire, mo  15345       elmer ure, m.d.      cardiology     vallejo general hospital     02 pheasant lane     brookshire, mo  15345  wj:ky:1946dd:4-12-84dt:4-13-84dv:4-12-84  approved but not reviewed by attending provider
