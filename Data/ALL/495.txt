diagnosis :chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .history of present illness :this 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least november 1993 , while he was living in aersing rocuch sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .he came to this country in late december 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .he had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .he became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .past medical history :significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an italian variation of digoxin , and amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ace inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .he also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .physical examination :he was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .he had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .there were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .he had no cardiac murmur .his abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .the neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .laboratory data :included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .there were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .the platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .his uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his ldh was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , bun and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .a computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest x-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .there was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .an electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .he did spike a fever and began ancef and gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .he also tried amicar and continued on low dose prednisone .his headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .there was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .a bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his cmml to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous cystosine arabinoside and 6-thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .he was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on allopurinol .the renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his gentamicin .the family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .he was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .they agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .no autopsy was obtained .lenni breutzoln , m.d.tr :lj / bmotdd :3/12/94td :03/13/94cc :dr. ca shuff , fih oregon dr. ille kote
