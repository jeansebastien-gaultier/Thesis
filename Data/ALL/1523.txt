a half years and she had been ratecontrolled with digoxin , lopressor , and diltiazem in the past. shehad been poorly compliant with her medications. in 9/19 , she hada mibi which was negative for reversible perfusion defect and in6/10 , she had an echo that showed normal left ventricular size andleft ventricular ejection fraction of 50 to 55% with a large leftatrium. she had moderate distal hypokinesis and trace tricuspidregurgitation and mitral regurgitation. in 7/13 , she had a holterthat showed atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter at a rate of 70 to185. in 4/3 , she was admitted to chokern hospitalwith substernal chest pain and increasing shortness of breath. achest x-ray at this time showed pulmonary edema. she was treatedwith intravenous lopressor and lasix and ruled out for a myocardialinfarction. one day prior to admission , the patient noted theonset of increasing shortness of breath and wheezing. she had acough productive of yellow sputum. she was seen in the emergencyroom and at that time , was afebrile with an o2 saturation of 93% onroom air. she was in atrial fibrillation at 100 and herlaboratories were within normal limits. she was discharged tohome. she returned to the emergency ward several hours later withpersistent shortness of breath now complaining of substernal chestpain. she did have a temperature of 101 at this point and she wasadmitted for further evaluation. she was given lasix 20 mgintravenously in the emergency room.past medical history: notable for: 1 ) chronic atrialfibrillation. 2 ) hypertension. 3 )non-insulin dependent

examination: she was a hispanic woman in no apparentdistress. her temperature was 101.6 , bloodpressure 122/70 , heart rate 110 , she was saturating 99% on twoliters. heent: examination was within normal limits. neck:supple with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.chest: showed diffuse expiratory wheezes with crackles at the leftbase. cardiac: examination showed an s1 and s2 with an irregularheartbeat , there were no murmurs , and her carotids were 2+ withoutbruits. abdomen: soft , non-tender , and non-distended.extremities: showed no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema.neurological: examination was within normal limits.laboratory examination: chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema withquestion of an infiltrate at the left basein addition. ekg showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 111 andshe had no t wave or st segment changes. her sma 7 was withinnormal limits , her white blood cell count was 8.7 , her hematocritwas 42 , her platelets were 201 , her liver function tests werewithin normal limits , her inr on admission was 1.7 , and her digoxinlevel was 0.4.hospital course: the patient was admitted for possible pneumoniaand rule out myocardial infarction as well ascongestive heart failure. she was started on cefotaximeintravenously and put on nebulized inhalers. all cultures , bloodand sputum cultures , were negative and her chest x-ray the next daywas clear suggesting that the patient most likely had atracheobronchitis rather than an actual pneumonia. from a cardiacstandpoint , she was admitted for rule out myocardial infarctionprotocol. she ruled out , she was given increased diuresis , and herrales and wheezes improved. over the next several days , she didwell , however , she did have still some evidence of congestive heartfailure on examination. an echo was obtained which showed anejection fraction of 50 to 55% with normal left ventricular size.the patient was therefore changed from digoxin to diltiazem 60t.i.d. for her rate control for atrial fibrillation. her lasixdose was also increased to 40 mg p.o. q.d. the atenolol wasdiscontinued. the patient did very well on this regimen. she hadno further evidence of rales or wheezing and her congestive heartfailure seemed to be in much better control. her heart rate waswell controlled on the diltiazem at a rate of 60 to 70 with bloodpressures of 120/70. her initial complaints of cough alsoresolved. she was changed to p.o. antibiotics and was sent home tocomplete a ten day course for presumed pneumonia.disposition: the patient is discharged in
