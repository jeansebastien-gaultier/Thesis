to 84% with minimal movement ). ingeneral , obese , tachypneic , ill-appearing woman. neck veinsdifficult to assess. cvs , distant heart sounds. pulmonary ,bibasilar rales. abdomen , obese , nontender

with 25% bands and 56% polys , troponin on admission0.19.hospital course:1. id: the patient's decreased o2 saturation , chest x-rayfindings were all consistent with a left lower lobe pneumonia.the patient was started on levaquin for a seven-day course. thepatient's levaquin was discontinued on 11/24/04 after a chest ctshowed no evidence of any further infiltrate in the left lowerlobe. the patient was able to be weaned off of oxygen and wassaturating in the high 90% at the time of discharge. the patientalso underwent urine , blood , and sputum cultures during thisadmission , which showed no growth of any organism.2. pulmonary: the patient had a history of left upper lobe lungcancer status post resection. the patient was continued on herflovent for management of likely copd. she underwent a chest ctduring this admission , which showed no evidence a mass orrecurrence of her lung cancer.3. ischemia: the patient was found to have a troponin as highas 23 during this admission and ruled in for a non-nstemi in thesetting of hypoxemia. the patient was continued on aspirin ,statin beta-blocker and ace inhibitor. she underwent adobutamine mibi on 3/2/05 , which showed areas of periinfarctischemia most prominent at the anterior wall. the patient thenunderwent a cardiac catheterization on 10/0/05 , which showedleft main disease at 50% as well as tight left circumferentiallad and a 100% rca lesion. the patient was then evaluated forcabg in light of her three-vessel coronary artery disease. dueto her multiple comorbidities , she underwent a preoperativeevaluation with the chest ct , carotid ultrasound , pulmonaryfunction test , and echocardiogram. the chest ct revealed noevidence of lung cancer recurrence. carotid ultrasound wassignificant for bilateral ica stenosis at 60%-65%. pft showed anfev1 of 1.2 liters or 61% predicted with an fev1/fvc ratio at 84%predicted. the echo showed an ef of 55% with mild lvh , mildhypokinesis of the inferior base and evidence of diastolicdysfunction. based on these test results , the patient was deemedable to undergo cabg. the patient's surgery was scheduled for9/8/05. the patient underwent preoperative evaluation by
