distress.social history:the patient was formerly employed as a cashier. she has twochildren. she is a former cigarette smoker. she does not usealcohol.family history:the patient has a positive family history of coronary disease ,hypertension and diabetes.hospital course by system/ problem:persistent pulmonary1. hypoxemic respiratory failure. on 1/7/06 , shortly afterher admission to the medical floor , the patient was noted to bein respiratory distress with tachypnea , accessory muscle use andoxygen saturation of 68% on 6 liters nasal cannula. she wasplaced on a nonrebreather. her oxygen saturation increased to93%; however , she continued to be in respiratory distress withtachypnea and accessory muscle use. she was intubated andtransferred to the medical intensive care unit for furtherevaluation and management. her respiratory failure was thoughtto be secondary to pneumonia with a component of superimposedvolume overload. she was treated with a 10-day course ofvancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime as well as with ivlasix. she underwent a code green on 7/30/06 during an ett tubechange , wherein a patent airway was transiently loss. thepatient was slow to wean from the ventilator. her chest imagingrevealed persistent bilateral opacifications. it was thoughtthat after an initial infectious insult , the patient developedards. on 9/14/06 , the patient underwent bronchoscopy and balrevealing mrsa and hsv. the patient was treated with a 10-daycourse of acyclovir for presumed hsv tracheobronchitis. givenher inability to be weaned from the vent , the patient underwent atracheostomy on 4/17/06 .  post-tracheostomy , the patientalternated between pressure support ventilation with low drivingpressure and peep with a trach collar..infectious disease:1. fevers. from 1/7/06 to 7/28/06 , the patient was treatedwith vancomycin , levofloxacin and ceftazidime for hospitalacquired pneumonia. after discontinuation of her antibiotics ,the patient continued to spike fevers and evidence ofleukocytosis. in verification into source of her fevers includedserial blood cultures , urine cultures and c-dif. positive dataincluded: 7/28/06 , urine culture with yeast , 7/28/06 , bloodculture with coag-negative staph , 9/14/06 bal washings with hsv ,9/14/06 , blood culture with coag-negative staph , 7/11/06 , bloodculture with coag-negative staph , 2/29/06 , urine culture withyeast , 2/29/06 bal washings with mrsa , 10/28/06 urine with yeasturine with yeast , 10/28/06 , 6/23/06 , 4/17/06 , and 10/11/06sputum with mrsa. 7/28/06 , chest ct with bilateralopacification in the lung parenchyma. 2/29/06 facial ct withleft sphenoid maxillary thickening. 2/29/06 chest ct withbilateral opacification in the lung parenchyma. of note , a2/29/06 abdominal ct showed no evidence of abdominal infection ,2/29/06 tte showed no obvious vegetations , and 10/11/06 tap ofthe right knee grew no organisms. in light of the data above ,the patient's indwelling catheters were changed. she underwenttreatment with linezolid x7 days for mrsa line infection. shealso underwent treatment with acyclovir x10 days for hsvtracheobronchitis. the aforementioned antibiosis was mostlyprophylactic. it was thought that the patient's intermittentfevers were not infectious , but rather reflected a drug allergy ,most likely to vancomycin. this hypothesis was supported by arobust eosinophilia coinciding with vancomycin administration.shortly after vancomycin discontinuation , the patient's feversresolved. the patient was afebrile for greater than 48 hours offall antibiotics prior to transfer to rehabilitation.cardiovascular:1. volume status. the patient's admission weight was 106.2 kg.it is unclear what her dry weight was. given that pulmonaryedema was thought to be contributing to the patient's slowventilator wean , she was diuresed with a combination of lasix anddiuril followed by combinations of torsemide and diuril. herdischarge weight was 100.7 kilograms. her diuretic regimen ondischarge with torsemide 100 mg iv t.i.d. and diuril 500 mg ivt.i.d. the patient's diuretic regimen will need be adjusted asher intake is adjusted. her creatinine will need to be monitoredvery closely. her weight will need to be checked daily.2. pump: the patient underwent echocardiogram on 11/19/06 ,7/17/06 , and 2/29/06 .  on the whole , these studies revealed anejection fraction of 45-50% , concentric lvh , global hypokinesiswith regional variation , mild left atrial enlargement , mildtricuspid regurgitation , a question of mild atrial stenosis , andpulmonary artery pressures in the 40s. for her heart failure ,the patient was treated with lopressor and diuretics as above.she was not started on an ace inhibitor given her allergy( cough ). she was started on low-dose arb.3. ischemia: the patient has a history of coronary arterydisease status post three-vessel cabg and subsequentsingle-vessel ppi. she has an rca stenosis , 70-80% that has notintervened upon. on admission , in the setting of respiratorydistress , the patient was in sinus tachycardia with rate relatedto lateral st depressions. her cardiac biomarkers were positiveconsistent with nstemi. it was thought that the patientexperienced demand ischemia rather than an acute plaque rupture.on 10/8/06 , her troponin peaked at 8.53 , her ck at 275 , and hermb of 16.3. the patient was treated with aspirin , lopressor , andzocor. she was not started on an ace inhibitor as detailedabove. she will likely warrant cardiology followup with possiblerca revascularization.neuro:1. sedation: while intubated , the patient was treated with ivversed and fentanyl titrated to light sedation. after hertracheostomy , the patient's versed and fentanyl drips werediscontinued. she was treated with seroquel at bedtime topreclude nighttime agitation. her qtc should be monitored whileon seroquel.gi:1. fen: the patient initially received tube feeds via feedingtube. she underwent a peg placement on 4/17/06 .  she continuedon tube feeds. she also passed speech and swallow and was thusstarted on p.o. feeds with aspiration precautions. she alsoreceived supplemental multivitamins , calcium carbonate , andcholecalciferol. the patient will require speech and swallowevaluation at rehabilitation. now that she is awake , she may beable to tolerate oral feeds with aspiration precautions.2. bowel regimen. the patient was treated with colace , senna ,and dulcolax.heme:1. anemia: the patient has known iron deficiency anemia. shewas continued on iron and folate. she may benefit from anoutpatient colonoscopy if she has not had one recently.2. bleeding from tracheostomy site: on 4/24/06 , the patientwas noted to have bleeding from her tracheostomy site. she hadno hematocrit drop. she remained hemodynamically stable. sheunderwent a bronchoscopy , which showed no active bleeding. hermild bleeding was thought to relate to suction trauma. herprophylactic heparin was held x1 day. it was thought that thepatient should be discharged on prophylactic heparin because herdvt risk is so high. should the patient have intense bleedingfrom the tracheostomy site , a hematocrit drop or hemodynamicchanges. her heparin subcu should be discontinued , herhematocrit should be monitored closely , and she should betransfused as needed. she should also at that point probablyundergo reevaluation by pulmonary or thoracics.endocrine:1. diabetes: the patient was treated with lantus plus regularinsulin q. 6h. plus sliding scale insulin while she was on tubefeeds. her insulin was changed on the night prior to discharge.she was started on lantus 100 subq b.i.d. she got her first doseof 100 units subq on the evening prior to discharge , her morningsugars were in the mid 100s. her blood sugars should be followedclosely on the first one or two days at rehab. the blood sugarsshould be monitored every 2-3 hours and her insulin should beadjusted accordingly. her insulin dose should be adjusted if hertube feeds are cycled rather than given continuously or if she isnpo.ortho:1. total knee replacement: the patient is status post righttotal knee replacement on 8/19/06 .  her right knee has awell-healed incision and is not erythematous or tender. thepatient was initially on low-dose anticoagulation with coumadin.her coumadin was discontinued given her acute illness and herneed for procedures. she was treated with heparin subqprophylactic doses 5000 units t.i.d. as described above. shewill need rehabilitation for her knee.2. prophylaxis: the patient was treated with subcutaneousheparin and nexium.3. access: the patient has peripheral ivs.discharge status:on the day of discharge 3/8/06 , the patient was afebrile.heart rate was in the 80s , blood pressure was in the100s-130s/60s-80s. discharge weight was 100.7 kilograms. thepatient was drowsy , but arouseable. she was breathing on a trachcollar. she had decreased breath sounds at the bases. she hadan s1 and s2 with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternalborder. her abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowelsounds. her trach and peg site were intact without anysurrounding erythema. her extremities were warm without edema.she was on trach collar with 50% fio2 and oxygen saturation of97%. her discharge labs included a white blood cell count of 21 ,stable , hematocrit of 28 , and platelets 436 , 000. her chem-7included a sodium of 131 , potassium 3 , chloride 87 , co2 32 , bun67 , creatinine 0.8 , and glucose 154. her lfts were normal. herinr was 1.1. her most recent microdata showed sputum with fewpolys and a few gram-positive cocci in clusters. her chest x-rayshowed a trach in place and bilateral hazy infiltrate consistentwith resolving ards.an addendum will be given with discharge medications and doses.at rehab , the patient's weight should be monitored daily. herblood sugars initially be monitored every 2-3 hours. after that ,her blood sugar monitoring can be spaced out to t.i.d. orwhenever deemed appropriate by the physician at therehabilitation facility. her hematocrit should be checkedparticularly if she has any bleeding from her tracheostomy site;otherwise , the hematocrit can be checked every day. the whiteblood cell count should be monitored if the patient has anyfever. the creatinine should be monitored daily in light of thepatient's changing diuretic regimen. the patient in's and out'sshould be monitored closely.contacts at the hospital:liri hospital of regarding the patient's inpatient course ordr. julio golding . contacts
