iii/viholosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla; s3 and s4 present;apical end pulses inferolaterally displaced and enlarged. abdomen:palpable pulsatile liver which is 3 cm below the costal margin ,nontender. abdomen is nontender , nondistended with good bowelsounds present. no splenomegaly. extremities: no edema present.extremities warm and dry with 2+ pulses bilaterally. tineainfection present in the axilla and groin. neurologic: alert andoriented time three. cranial nerves iii-xii were grossly intact.motor strength was 5/5 throughout. toes are downgoing bilaterally.laboratory studies: sodium 137 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 99 ,bicarbonate of 28 , bun 18 , creatinine 1 ,glucose 91 , alt 249 , ast 140 , ldh 228 , alk phos 48 , total bilirubin 1.2 ,direct bilirubin 0.6. white blood cell count 5.4 , hematocrit 35.2 ,platelets 186. albumin 3.2 , uric acid 10.3. ekg is normal sinusrhythm at 97. no st changes or q waves present. positive lvh.chest x-ray was without edema or infiltrate. cardiomegaly ispresent. enlarged pulmonary arteries. cardiac catheterizationrevealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 28 , pulmonary artery70/30 , rv 70/8 , right atrium 12 , mixed venous saturation 45% , svcsaturation 95%.hospital course: following cardiac catheterization , mr. estevanewas admitted for tailored therapy , and wasstarted on nitroprusside in addition to iv diuresis with lasix ,captopril , and isordil. digoxin was continued , and he was sodiumand fluid restricted. he was also admitted for a transplantevaluation. as part of his workup , hepatitis serologies were sent ,as well as out of concern for his elevated lfts. these werenegative , except for a borderline hepatitis b antibody. lftsgradually decreased throughout his hospitalization , and were likelyelevated due to passive congestion due to heart failure. alsoalcohol use is possible but less likely due to the pattern ofelevated lfts.by the next day following nitroprusside therapy overnight , his svrhad decreased to 1000 with cardiac output of 4.71 , cvp wasdecreased to 9 , and he had significant diuresis as furtherevidenced by his weight loss. captopril and isordil doses wereincreased while weaning nitroprusside for a goal systolic bloodpressure greater than 80 to 90 and svr less than 1200. his gicomplaints resolved immediately upon admission. he had no furtherepisodes of diarrhea , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting. thus , nofurther workup was done at this time. of note , he was on fannierippel protocol and was randomized to hemodynamic therapy.captopril was increased to final dose of 50 mg q.i.d. with isordilincreased to 20 mg t.i.d. nitroprusside was weaned off on 9/20/97.iv lasix was switched to p.o. on 9/20/97.by 0/21/97 , he continued to feel very well without any complaintsof dyspnea on exertion , light-headedness , dizziness , or shortnessof breath. he did begin to complain of cough , possibly productiveof clear sputum , beginning on this day. he did have one episode ofa four beat run of asymptomatic nonsustained v-tach which waswell-tolerated.on march , he had a repeat ett which he completed in 5 minutes and 40seconds. it was stopped secondary to leg fatigue with a max heart of 132.ekg was without changes on exercise. peak v. o2 of 14.3 and without ischemia.lasix dose was optimized with final dose of 40 mg p.o. cough continued , and achest x-ray was obtained which was negative for infiltrate. sputum was sentand was also negative. he felt that the symptom might be due to post nasaldrip which he has had in the past , and this symptom will have to be followed.as part of his transplant workup , an abdominal ultrasound was negative ,although of note , his gallbladder could not be optimally visualized due to acontraction of the gallbladder. a repeat ett was as mentioned above.echocardiogram revealed lv dilatation with severe lv dysfunction , ef 15% ,global hypokinesis , right ventricular dilatation with mild-to-moderatedysfunction , left atrial enlargement , 3+ mr , 2+ tr with a peak velocity of 3.2consistent with pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 40 mm greater than rightatrial pressure. pulmonary function tests revealed svc of 3.35 , 67% ( fev1 of2.78 , 67% ) , fev1/fvc of 83% , fef 25-75 68% , fvl co corrected 85% as predicted.hepatitis studies , as mentioned above. cmv: igg positive , igm negative. ebv:igg positive , igm negative. mumps positive , vzv positive. toxoplasma iggborderline , low positive; igm negative. ppd with mumps and candida controlwere placed on 8/27/97 , and the patient was to return to the hospital on10/3/97 to be examined.by march , 1997 , the patient was feeling extremely well , andambulating without difficulty. he had improved energy andappetite , and was afebrile. he denied any shortness of breath ,chest pains , palpitations , and was felt to be stable for discharge.procedures: he underwent an echocardiogram on 8/27/97 , ett8/27/97 , abdominal ultrasound 8/27/97 , pulmonaryfunction test 8/27/97 , cardiac catheterization 0/20/97.discharge medications: captopril 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.; isordil 20 mgp.o. t.i.d.; lasix 40 mg p.o. q. day withinstructions that if his weight increased by three to four pounds ,he should take 80 mg of lasix that day; lotrimin 1% cream topicalb.i.d.; and digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.diet: he was also discharged on a 2 gram sodium diet with 2 literfluid restriction.follow-up: he will return to the hospital on 10/3/97 to have hisppd and controls read by myself. he will alsofollow-up with dr. giallorenzo in clinic in two weeks.dictated by: anderson e. serandos , m.d. hz168attending: heriberto torrell , m.d. sc8dh368/8821batch: 37423 index no. novyw83kos d: 10/14/97t: 10/14/97[report_end]
