doses given the intolerable side effects of avandia.  he has plans for elective knee replacement during the spring and we have advised him that before he consider that he should get his diabetes under better control, should make sure his blood pressure is controlled and should seek cardiac evaluation, especially given his history of pulmonary edema symptoms on avandia.1.  we will start insulin today initially nph 25 units at bedtime to replace his evening dose of glyburide.  we have instructed him on use of the inolet for insulin administration.  he will continue his glyburide 10 mg each morning, continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and avandia 2 mg each morning.  we will check hemoglobin a1c today as a baseline. we will follow up to determine appropriate titration of his insulin as well as addition of other doses during the day.2.  his blood pressure is not optimally controlled at this time.  we will increase his lisinopril to 40 mg daily. he will continue his furosemide 60 mg

the patient has an ldl that was above target this summer and lipitor was initiated; however, he has not been on this long enough to see an effect. at his next visit, we will reevaluate his lipids to determine if his lipitor needs titration.5.  he is overdue for an eye exam and will contact dr. xuereb at findlay him to have this done.6.  we have made a referral to dr. liam mcmahon for cardiology evaluation.  we have ordered an echocardiogram to be performed prior to this visit. we have also referred the patient to a number of possible pcps in the omc/cbc system. the patient was advised to return to the office in two months for follow up.______________________________florence mildred yuan, mddictated by: florence mildred yuanescription document:2-8940866 emssten teldd: 12/16/84dt:
