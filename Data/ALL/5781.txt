> ciprofloxacin ).per ercp fellow , plan is for patient to return in four weeks to see dr. suzanne davis , at which time he will likely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone .if this is still problematic , pt may also need a sphincterotomy .dr.demby secretary will contact patient at home the week after discharge to schedule this for the end of january .pt is to continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course .2) mechanical mitral valve : anticoagulation was reversed for ercp .after this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip .inr was 1.9 on discharge .he was given sc lovenox x 1 and will continue this the day after discharge bid for one day .vna will check his inr at home and page his pcp with the results .3) atrial fibrillation : rate controlled and on warfarin .while in the hospital he had several episodes of pauses , none longer than 2.5 seconds .his digoxin was held and his metoprolol was titrated down from his home dose .once the digoxin was no longer having effect , metoprolol was titrated back to home dose .4) chf : pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course , cxr was consistent with pulmonary edema .he was diuresed with lasix with good effect .volume overload likely ocurred in the setting of iv fluids given in the icu .did not require lasix on discharge .5) e. coli bacteremia / sepsis : source of acute cholangitis as above .pt required 3 day stay in the surgical icu and intubation as above .6) intubation : pt was 97% on room air on arrival to cindy , developed rapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated , but after that period of time required oxygen , presumably for pulmonary edema .in the lori pt was given 3l ns as well as 1 unit of ffp , and oxygen requirements contimued to climb .in the cmed ccu pt was intubated for ercp procedure .he was extubated the next morning .medications on admission :lisinopril 2.5 qday , buspiron 20 mg po qday , digoxin , doxasozin 8 mg qhs , glyburide 2.5 mg qday , metoprolol bid , atorvastatin 20 mg qday , warfarin 5 mg qdaydischarge medications :1. ciprofloxacin 500 mg tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po q12h ( every 12 hours ) for 6 days .disp : 12 tablet (s) refills : 0 2. medicationscontinue all other home medications except do not take digoxin .discharge disposition :home with servicedischarge diagnosis :primary diagnosis :acute cholangitissecondary diagnosis :anticoagulation with a mechanical valveatrial fibrillationdiabetes mellituscongestive heart failuredischarge condition :stable , will work with home ptdischarge instructions :please continue ciprofloxacin antibiotic until 2019-02-14 .dr. mcfarlane is the doctor who performed the procedure to place a stent in your bile duct ( a tube that drains the liver ).his nurse is going to contact you at home to schedule a time for a repeat procedure to remove that stent .you will have your blood drawn tomorrow ( 2019-02-10 ) by vna .it will be called in to dr. hamasaki office and he will call you to see how to change your coumadin .you will also take lovenox subcutaneous injections tomorrow , 2019-02-10 .you will take one if the morning and one at night .continue all of your medications except for digoxin .followup instructions :dr. mcfarlane is the doctor who performed the procedure to place a stent in your bile duct ( a tube that drains the liver ).his nurse is going to contact you at home to schedule a time for a repeat procedure to remove that stent .before you have the procedure with dr. morris you will need to talk to dr. moya to see if you need to stop your coumadin / warfarin for a few days .shirley anthony md 56-333completed by : donald beverly md 74-194 2019-02-09 @ 1644signed electronically by : dr. shirley v usher on : sat 2019-02-09 5:32 pm( end of report )
