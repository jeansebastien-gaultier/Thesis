coronary artery disease.  7.  hypertension, with vigorous left ventricular systolic function and a rigid vasculature, with severe chest and back discomfort with elevated pressures. a.  long use of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide and  during 01/95 admission for post narcotic lightheadedness, blood pressure noted to be significantly elevated.  b.  11/95 complaints of chest tightness and blood pressure above 230 mmhg systolic.  chest discomfort improved with lower blood pressure.  c.  11/95 investigations for hypertension:  bun below 10, creatinine 0.6, potassium 3.6, calcium 9.1, tsh 2.17.

changes atop baseline inferolateral st segment depressions.  no wall motion abnormalities.  ef 70%.  dear bethany: i saw your patient, fay foust, in my office today.  mrs. foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.  her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a cta that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type ii diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.  ms. foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.  she takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmhg range to 120/80 mmhg range.  she believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.  after 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.  at 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.  when she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.  she has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.  she has not had palpitations.  she has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.  she is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits. she has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.  she has not had any peripheral numbness.  the rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.  the present medications are asa 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner. on examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.  the blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmhg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.  later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmhg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.  she was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.  the skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.  she is fully alert.  the neck veins are not elevated.  the carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.  there are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.  the lungs are clear.  the pmi is not displaced.  there is a normal-sounding s1 and a physiologically split s2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with valsalva.  the abdomen is benign. there is no renal artery bruit.  the distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.  there is no tenderness of her skin.  the resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral st segment flattening. impression:  mrs. foust is feeling much-improved.  the dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmhg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.  however, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmhg.  though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, i think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.  i think that we should continue her on her present regimen.  gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.  i think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.  we are pleased with the present regimen.  we have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.  we were not surprised by her cta and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.  i think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup a1c values.  thank you for allowing me to assist in mrs. foust's care.  i know that you will continue to follow her closely.  i told her that i would see her again in nine months.  sincerely,______________________________stephen c rice, m.d.escription document:8-1475473dd: 03/18/96dt: 03/19/96dv: 03/18/96
