a 17 x 14 mm intraparenchymal bleed in the leftlentiform nucleus is unchanged from the prior ct approximatelysix hours prior. there is mild mass effect due to surroundingedema with compression of the adjacent sulci, but no shift ofthe normal midline structures or evidence of herniation. no newfoci of hemorrhage are present.a hypodense region just anterior to the hemorrhage is likely anold lacunar infarct. the ventricles and sulci are normal in sizeand configuration. the basal cisterns are patent. the visualizedparanasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavitiesare clear.impression: no change in the left lentiform nucleusintraparenchymal hemorrhage. this is likely secondary tohypertension. further workup to exclude vascular or neoplasticetiologies can be pursued based on clinical

[hospital6 3105] with right sidedweakness (arm>face>leg) and dysarthria. ct revealed a left basalganglia iph and he was transferred to [hospital1 18] on [2104-12-29]. giventhe presence of the iph, his

stable and nosignificant aneurysm was identified. although the most likelycause for his iph is hypertension, it was not possible to do anmri to look for an underlying lesion given pacemaker. aspirinshould be started in 1 week and he will not be continued onwarfarin. he was transferred to rehab on [2104-12-31] and hasneurology follow-up. he should have a repeat ct head with andwithout contrast prior to his follow-up to assess for thepresence of an underlying mass lesion...# neuro: patient had a previous stroke as above with no residualdeficits and presented with right face, arm and leg weakness inthe setting of some mild neck pain but no clear headache on[2104-12-29]. at osh he was found to have a left basal gangliahemorrhage. he was given 10 mg of vitamin k for an inr of 2.6(no ffp was given) and labetalol 20 mg iv for a sbp in the 170s.he was then transferred to [hospital1 18] for further management. at[hospital1 18] ed, he received profilinine (activated factor ix) andreceived 2 units ffp later for inr 2.3. examination revealedright hemiparesis and right facial droop with dysarthria but noaphasia, neglect or visual field defect. he was started on anicardipine infusion for sbp up to 200s and was admitted to theneuro icu.his head cts remained stable showing no extension of the bleed.cta showed an old infarct in the left anterior basal gangliaextending into the corona radiata with ex vacuo dilatation ofthe left lateral ventricle in addition to multiple chroniclacunar infarcts in the right caudate and lentiform nuclei andangiography demonstrated a less than 2-mm sized aneurysm arisingfrom the left ica bifurcation.stroke risk factors were assessed with hba1c 5.4% and flprevealed cholesterol 240 tgcs 111 hdl 41 ldl 177. ces werenegative. he was initially monitored with glucose fingersticksand this was stopped after several normal readings. he wastherefore started on atorvastatin 40mg daily and his fastinglipids should be repeated in 3 months.he continued to receive daily vitamin k until [2104-12-30] and inron [2104-12-31] was 1.0. he passed bedside swallow evaluation andwas placed on a regular diet. he slowly improved and wastransferred to the neurology floor on [2104-12-30]. we held allantiplatelets and aspirin 325mg should be started in 1 week. westopped warfarin due to his hemorrhage. we were unable to obtainan mri given the patient's pacemaker and he will therefore needa repeat ct scan with contrast to evaluate any possiblemalignancy underlying the hemorrhage before his neurologyappointment.the most likely cause of his hemorrhage is a hypertensive bleedalthough his hypertension was controlled previously. as above wewill evaluate with interval scan to look for an underlyinglesion which may have bled.his weakness was slowly improving at the time of discharge. hewas stable and bp was controlled on his home medications. he wasassessed by pt and deemed to benefit from rehab. he wastherefore transferred to rehab on [2104-12-31]..# cvs: bp was initially uncontrolled and was markelyhypertensive requiring iv meds and icu admission. this waslatterly controlled and bp on discharge was sbp 120s-130s. hewas briefly hypotensive in the setting iv nicardipine and homeanti-hypertensives and this resolved before transfer to theflor. we continued patient's home lisinopril and carvedilol.  wemonitored his inr daily and was 1.0 on discharge. warfarin wasstopped and he should be restarted on aspirin 325mg daily in 1week. patient was started on atorvastatin 40mg daily as aboveand should have repeat flp in 3 months..# renal: patient was admitted with cr 1.3. he was not known tohave crf. his cr rose to 1.6 post-ct contrast on [2104-12-31]. thisshould be repeated in 2 days time and then at least weekly..#

name (namepattern1) ] [first name (titles) ] [last name (titles) ]. you presented withright-sided weakness and facial droop. you had a ct scan andwere found to have a bleed in your brain in the area of the leftbasal ganglia. as you were on warfarin (coumadin) which is ablood thinner and worsens bleeding, this was reversed withmedications and coumadin was stopped. your blood pressure wasinitially high and you had to be treated with iv medications tolower your blood pressure in the icu. your blood pressurenormalised and you were transferred to the neurology floor. youdid well and your strength on the right side was slowlyimproving. your warfarin was stopped and should not be continueddue to further risk of bleeding. you should stop aspirincurrently and restrat at 325mg daily in 1 week. we also startedatorvastatin for high cholesterol as your cholesterol was foundto be high. this should be repeated in 3 months time. yourkidney function tests were also slightly abnormal following thect contrast and this will be followed at rehab. you werecontinued on your other home medications. the most likely causeof this brain hemorrhage was high blood pressure although givenyour pacemaker we were unable to do an mri. as a result you willneed to have a repeat ct scan in 6 weeks  as at this point theblood should have reabsorbed and we will be able to look to seeif there is any lesion underlying your hemorrhage. you weredeemed appropriate for rehab and transferred to rehab on[2104-12-31]..medication changes:we stopped aspirin and this should be restarted at 325mg dailyin 1 weekwe
