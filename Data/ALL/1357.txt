hx of bronchiectasis s/p lobectomy, chronic mac, htn, fibromyalgia, and raynaud   s presented to osh w/ chest pain, transferred to pch w/nstemi and dvts.hpi: pt at baseline occasionally gets sob from her bronchiectasis if she has not had chest pt recently but otherwise is able to walk up multiple flights of stairs without sob.  she has no known cardiac hx but does have htn and + fam hx of early cad.  pt awoke this morning in her usoh but quickly had sudden onset of 10/10 sharp sscp radiating to her right arm associated w/ right arm numbness.  pain is slightly better w/ sitting up though pt denies pleuritic quality.  she then had a vasovagal attack, which she has had before in the setting of pain, and she started to feel lightheaded, nauseated, and diaphoretic.  she laid down on the floor and elevated her legs above her head which helped a little.  her husband gave her excedrin w/o improvement and called 911.  ems gave her 3 puffs of ntg and 4 baby asa w/o effect.  the ambulance brought her to the closest hospital, colorow.  in the ed, she was found to be hypertensive w/ sbp 180s, for which she was started on tng gtt.  she also underwent pe ct which per report was neg for pe but showed bilat dvts, and she was started on heparin.  she was given fioricet, zofran, and fentanyl for her cp w/ relief.  she was then given a dose of iv lopressor and also had one episode of n/v.  her labs were significant for + cardiac markers: 1st set w/ ck/mb/index 39/0.9/2.3, trop i 0.03, 2nd 443/57.3/12.9, trop 2.22, 3rd set 686/87.3/12.7, trop 4.18.  ekgs showed right-bundle morphology (though qrs not wide) w/ initial twi v1-v3 which progressed to deepening twi v1-v4 and some downsloping std v3-v4.  pt is currently chest pain free, no sob, no palpitations.  she denies any preceding viral illness or any surprises or acute stressors in her life, though she has many chronic medical problems.ros:    as per hpipmh:     1.  history of bronchiectasis s/p right middle lobectomy in 2128.
