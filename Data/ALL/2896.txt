admission date :2-5-94discharge date :4-2-94history of present illness :the patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .the patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .she did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .this may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .she underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in march through may of 1993 .she had been doing reasonably well until december of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .a bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .she has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .a barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .hospital course :the patient was admitted on february 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .the patient was brought to the operating room on february 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the operating room on february 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .she then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .the pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .she remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the respiratory intensive care unit .the patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included vancomycin , ceftazidime and gentamicin .on postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .an endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .she received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .the patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .a repeat echocardiogram on february 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on february 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .a pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on february 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .she remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .her chest x-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .she suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .her steroids were weaned .because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on february 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .she remained in a coma .the blood cultures on february 26 , 1994 grew out staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .her sputum grew out pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .the urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .on march 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .there was a large left pleural effusion however .this was drained with a left chest tube .her sputum then grew out klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .she developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .on march 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .she was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .on march 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and fentanyl .this was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .she continued to require pressor support in the high 30 &apos;s .she also fell into a coma once again .on march 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .on april 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .discussions were held with the patient &apos;s family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .she had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of jose pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .decision was made in conjunction with the family and dr. caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .the patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a t-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on april 2 , 1994 .
