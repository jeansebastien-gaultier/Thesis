old gentleman with a pmh significant for hcv cirrhosiscomplicated by hcc s/p lobe resection in [2156], who presented onpost-operative day 12 from craniotomy for a subdural hematomawith fever, rash, and hypotension..#. hypotension and fever: there was immediate concern for sepsison presentation to the ed, although no apparent source wasisolated and no significant fever was recorded in the hospital(had 100.4 on admission to the ed). sepsis workup was negativeincluding cxr, ua, urine and blood cultures. final blood cutlureresults are still pending. given recent craniotomy theneurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for cnsinfection. a ruq ultraound was performed that confirmed amoderate amount of ascites and patency of the hepatic vessels,but the abdomen was not tender and the suspicion for sbp waslow. adrenal insuficiency was ruled out per cosyntropin test.the patient did receive a dose of vancomycin and levofloxacin inthe ed but none were continued in the icu as the patientremained afebrile and the icu team's suspicion for infectiousprocess was low. the patient recieved a dose of iv steroids inthe ed and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of prednisone60mg. dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for hispresentation, especially given the acute renal failure andassociated morbilliform rash, as a type iv drug reaction,including dress, though no eosinophilia was noted ondifferential. adittionally patient had recently been started onkeflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins isanother possibility. both dilantin and keflex were discontinuedand should be avoided in the future.  the patient remainedafebrile and normotensive during his icu stay and the day afteradmission was transferred to the oncology service. he remainedstable on the oncology floor and is now discharged back to rehabfacility..#. acute renal failure: patient was admitted with a serumcreatinine of 1.2, up from a known baseline of 0.9 to 1 likelypre-renal failure in the setting of hypotension. his cr. ondischarge was 0.9. renal functions and electrolytes should befollowed in the outpatient setting..#. elevated liver enzymes: 2/2o hepatitis c cirrhosis andhepatocellular carcinoma: patient failed interferon andribavirin in the past. patient with known multifocal hccrecurrence re-confirmed per ruq ultrasound on this admission..# metabolic acidosis: initially normochloremic with slightlyelevated ag, then hyperchloremic with normal anion gap. likelyinitially [1-15] to tissue hypoperfusion given the elevated lactateon admission. lactate was 3.1 on admission and decreased to 1.3.also contributed to by renal failure. bicarbonate trending up ondischarge..# anemia: at baseline of 30-35. had initial drop of hctsecondary to rehydration and resolution of hemmoconcentration,hct back to baseline at discharge..#. hypertension: anti-hypertensives were held in the setting ofhypotension. tamsulosin 0.4 mg was restarted on discharge.amlodipine continues to be held on discharge.#. hypothyroid: patient was continued on levothyroxine withoutevent. of note patient found to have increased palpable rightlower thyroid lobe. further workup of this finding may beconsidered in the out patient setting..# code status during this admission: fullmedications on admission:1. amlodipine 5 mg daily2. tamsulosin 0.4 mg hs3.
