(checkwith your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) if you feelthat you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. you mayuse over the counter metamucil or milk of magnesia. appetitesuppression may occur; this will improve with time. eat smallbalanced meals throughout the day.cautions:no smoking! we know you've heard this before, but it really isan important step to your recovery. smoking causes narrowing ofyour blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. if yousmoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. ask your nurseor doctor for information on smoking cessation.avoid heavy lifting (over 20 pounds) for 8 weeks after surgery.no strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery.diet:there are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequentmeals may be preferred.for people with vascular problems we would recommend acholesterol lowering diet: follow a diet low in total fat andlow in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profilein your blood. additionally, some people see a reduction inserum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. since areduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest thatmost people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol todecrease total cholesterol and ldl (low density lipoprotein-thebad cholesterol). exercise will increase your hdl (high densitylipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor'spermission, is typically recommended. you may be self-referredor get a referral from your doctor.if you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weightmanagement program. your health and its improvement depend onit. we know that making changes in your lifestyle will not beeasy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a newattitude. if interested you can may be self-referred or can geta referral from your doctor.if you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you mayrequest a referral from your doctor.follow-up appointment:be sure to keep your medical appointments. the key to yourimproving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of thechronic medical conditions that you have. things like high bloodpressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains tothe blood vessels. don't let them go untreated!please call the office on the first working day after yourdischarge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. thisshould be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen daysafter discharge. normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 mondaythrough friday.please feel free to call the office with any other concerns orquestions that might arise.followup instructions:calll dr [last name (stitle) ] office at [telephone/fax (1) 3121]. schedule anapppointment for 2 weekscompleted by:[2196-11-10]
