admission date :2014-11-29discharge date :2014-12-05service :medicinehistory of present illness :47 yo f w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , sle w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o rle dvt a/w f 2014-11-29 transferred to cmed 2014-11-30 for hypotn resistant to ivfs and stress steroids .patient initially p/w c/o sudden onset n/abd pain/chills w/ t 103 at nh .rigors progressed so she was brought to robert .she reported h/o fatigue and anorexia for the past few days and had noticed foul smelling urine and some abdominal distension , similar to prior episodes of pyelo .she also c/o llq and groin pain which responded to tylenol .she denies v or d .no ams .no c/o cp .on arrival to shirley , temperature was 101.2 .ct abd showed an 8 mm right proximal ureteral stone with right-sided hydronephrosis and inflammatory stranding , in addition to pyelonephritis of the left kidney without left sided hydronephrosis .labs were remarkable for wbc 23.5 w/ 1% bands which decreased to 14 today but now w/ 15% bands on vanc ( h/o mrsa urosepsis ) and gent ( mult drug allergies ) .ag on admission 18 ( bicarb 17 , down from 23 on a previous admission ) , down to ag 15 this am .abg prior to transfer ( on room air ) :7.43/24/69 w/ lactate 1.3 ( down from 1.4 on the prior day ) .currently , 03-14 blood cx are growing gnr in both anaerobic bottles .urine cx is pending .prior to transfer , patient dropped bp to 68/40s .bp did not improve despite 2 l ns and 100 mg iv hydrocortisone .a central line was placed and she was sent to ir for a right nephrostomy tube .brief hospital course :47 yo f w/ h/o steroid-induced hyperglycemia , sle w/ h/o pericarditis , transverse myelitis w/ paraplegia and neurogenic bladder s/p urostomy w/ ileal conduit , h/o ureteropelvic stone and urosepsis , and h/o rle dvt admitted 11-29 w/ left pyelo and right 8 mm proximal ureteral stone w/ right hydro s/p perc urostomy tube to relieve right hydro ..## gnr sepsis:upon admission , pt was febrile to 101.2 with u/a consistent with uti .a ct abd showed 8mm obstructing stone , hydro with stranding consistent with pylonephritis .her presentation was thought likely due to urosepsis given h/o foul smelling urine and in setting of stone w/ hydro + pyelo by ct. the patient went to ir on 2014-11-30 given evidence of right hydronephrosis on imaging for decompression and drainage. upon admission , she was treated with vancomycin and gentamycin and flagyl .she was started on the must protocol with high dose steroids as well and a goal svo2 >70% .she was hypoxic requiring 3l nasal cannula o2 .she subsequently developed hypotension with sbp in the 70s .she was transferred to the cmed where the patient was continued on the must protocol with goais of cvp 10-12 , svo2 greater than 70% .the patient was bolused with ns and did not required pressors .on the day after admission to the cmed , the patient was noted to have small oxygen requirement with 2l nc .repeat imaging revealed evidence of mild pulmonary congestion which was thought to account for the patient 's mild hypoxia .given that the patient had been maintaining a map of 60 without fluids or pressors , her goal cvp was decreased to >8 to avoid fluid overload .the patient was continued on vancomycin and gentamycin while speciation and sensitivities were pending .ciprofloxacin was added on 2014-12-01 for synergy when surveillance cultures were found to be growing again gnr .gent and cipro were then discontinued and changed to meropenem when blood culture sensitivities became available revealing gnr sensitive to jacoby but resistant to both gent and cipro .additionaly surveillance cultures were drawn daily and the patient was transferred back to the floor with no subsequent pressor requirement .blood cltures from 11-30 grew klebsiella pneumoniae and 12-01 grew klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis both sensitive to the meropenam which she had already been receiving .urine cultures from 11-30 grew staph aureus coag + , and gram negative rods of two morphologies ( not further speciated ) .she defervesed by 12-02 and remained clinically stable with normal blood pressures until the day of discharge .at the time of discharge , blood cultures from 12-02 and 12-03 have no growth to date .she received a midline on 12-04 with a goal of 16 days of further antibiotic treatment with meropenam ( for a total of 3 weeks ) upon discharge back to the nursing home where she lives ..## right hydronephrosis :given right sided hydronephrosis and gnr bactermeia , a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed by ir 2014-11-30 .the patient put out 1385 cc urine the day after placement , 950 cc of which came from nephrostomy tube .the tube appeared to be functioning well , draining urine with occasional clot passage .urology was notified about the clots and occasional blood tinged urine but they did not make any further recommendations .cultures from urine drawn from the nephrostomy tube are currently growing > 100k gnr , possibly of two colony morphologies , speciation and sensitivity pending ..## hct drop :on admission to hospital patient had hct of 29.2 .in the setting of right sublavian line placement as well as nephrostomy tube placement the patient was noted to have a drifting hct , concerning for bleed , with nadir of 22.8 on 2014-12-01 .a ct abdomen was performed which did not demonstrate any retroperitoneal bleed .hct stabilized to 24 for three days prior to discharge .this can be followed as an outpatient .anemia workup revealed a picture of anemia of chronic disease ( tibc 225 , b12 and folate normal , hapto 397 , ferritin 51 , trf 173 , iron 35 ) ..## hypoxia:the patient on admission was requiring 3 l nc in the setting of receiving 2l ns and chest film which demonstrated pulmonary congestion .the patient was not diuresed but allowed to auto-diurese any additional fluids and is currently with o2 sats 97-98% on room air .as her bp remained stable she did not receiving any standing fluids but was be bolused as appropriate for a map < 60 or cvp < 8 with careful monitoring of pulmonary status .patient had an echocardiogram in 2012 which demonstrated an ef of 60-65% .her o2 requirement by discharge was 96% on room air with no sob ..## steroid-induced hyperglycemia :at home , the patient received metformin and ssi .the patient 's metformin was held and she has been maintained on ssi qid while in the cmed .as the patient appeared to be clinically stable , her stress dose steroids were discontinued and the patient was changed back to her home dose of prednisone 40mg po qd for maintenance with anticipated decrease in her blood sugars .her metformin was re-added 2 days prior to discharge as well and fingerstick glucoses on the day of discharge were 93 and 156 , respectively ..## hypothyroidism :repeat tsh and free t4 were appropriate on current outpatient regimen. patient was continued on levothyroxine 75mcg po qd ..## h/o transverse myelitis/optic neuritis :on stress dose steroids originally given must protocol and sepsis , as patient clinically stabilized , she was changed back to home dose of prednisone 40mg po qd ..## sle :currently no sx of active disease .no manifestations of sle during this admission ..# osteoporosis - we continued actonel/vit d , tums.## capsular ossification :we continued cmed csru gtt ..## fen:she had a low bicarb likely due to renal wasting but there is an anion gap present .serum acetone was normal .we followed lactate while she was in the cmed which was normal .she was npo periodically but maintained a normal diet prior to discharge ..# ppx - sq heparin during this admission , ppi.## communication : patient.## dispo :to nursing home for follow up with dr. hipp ( urology ) this coming monday , 12-08 at 1:30pm and with her pcp at the nursing home
