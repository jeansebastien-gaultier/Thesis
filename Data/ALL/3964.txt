however , thepatient's weight had decreased only to 124.6 kg. her admissionweight on 9/8/2006 was 130 kg. however , this weight wasrecorded in the bed ( not standing ). her first standing weightwas recorded on 7/0/2006 at 125 kg. her lower extremity edemaonly mildly improved , however , at the time of this dictation , thepatient was able to put her shoes on , which she was unable to doprior to admission. during this diuresis , the patient'spotassium was repleted twice a day. she was also maintained onaldactone and acetazolamide ( for elevated co2 levels ). thepatient's lipid profile was measured during this hospitalizationand she had an ldl of 64. she was maintained on zocor. aspirincannot be administered due to the patient's drug allergy profile.from a rhythm standpoint , the patient remained in atrialfibrillation during this hospitalization through 7/6/2006. shewas not anticoagulation , given her history of hit and history ofgastrointestinal bleed on coumadin.2. pulmonary: the patient was maintained on bipap and flonasethroughout her hospitalization. her mental status was monitoredclosely given her previous micu stay during her last admissionfor an elevated pco2. however , the patient was alert andoriented x3 during her hospitalization.3. renal: the patient's creatinine was stable at approximately1.1 during her diuresis through 11/13/2006.4. gastrointestinal: the patient was maintained on nexiumduring her hospitalization. her hematocrit remained stable atapproximately 32.4.5. endocrinology: the patient was maintained on levoxyl and herhome nph regimen.6. infectious disease: the patient was given vancomycin forcellulitis on her left shin , which appeared to be improving asthe erythematous area was decreasing from 4/9/206 to11/13/2006. she was also started on gentamicin on 5/2/2006 forasymptomatic bacteriuria. the patient's urine culture on7/0/2006 greater than 100 , 000 colonies of pseudomonas.code status: during this hospitalization , the patient reiteratedthat she is a full code. it was discussed with her that she isdifficult and in fact possibly and possible intubation. she wasone time intubated nasally. in any event , she wants all lifesaving measures performed. at the time of this dictation , she isa full code ( healthcare proxy harry behran , phone number ( 006 ) 898-1411 ).escription document: 5-8322613 bffocusdictated by: garmoe , virgilattending: balls , thurmandictation id 4095382d: 3/13/06t: 9/18/06[report_end]
