admission date :2012-11-21discharge date :2012-11-28service :transplanthistory of present illness :this is a 37-year-old female who presents on an elective basis for a living-related kidney transplant .the patient has a history of end-stage renal failure secondary to type 1 diabetes with a baseline creatinine of around 5 .she is receiving a kidney from her sister .the patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , and insulin-dependent diabetes for 32 years .she is status post myocardial infarction in april of this year and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery .she present electively on the morning of her surgery with no recent changes in her medical problems .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the preoperative holding area and taken electively to the operating room .she underwent a living-related renal transplant in the right iliac fossa .the operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder .otherwise , there were difficulties , and estimated blood loss was minimal .she was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine .intraoperatively , for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and solu-medrol .she was started on prograf and cellcept in the postoperative period .she was also maintained on bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir , as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative .the patient 's initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful .her creatinine , which was 5 initially postoperatively , slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of 1 .she did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin .her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course , and her prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between 10 and 15 .she continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids .on postoperative day three , the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the renal and surgical residents .it was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the surgical intensive care unit .her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of 200/120 .her electrocardiogram showed no specific st changes , but there was some loss of her r wave progression laterally .serial enzymes were drawn , and cardiology was consulted .with blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction , the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the intensive care unit .throughout this time , her creatinine continued to drop , and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode .her beta blocker was progressively increased , and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down .two days after this event , she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis .this was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction .clinically , she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge .she was transferred out of the intensive care unit on postoperative day five and was stable on the floor for the next two days .
