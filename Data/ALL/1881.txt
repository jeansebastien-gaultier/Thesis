the original 90% lesion was stented to 0%occlusion. during the catheterization , dr. taran noted a gradient of40mmhg from the thoracic aorta to the femoral aorta raising thepossibility of this as an etiology for mr. mcconnell 's severe lower back painand limited ability to ambulate. the catheterization was withoutcomplications. the patient was placed on plavix x 6 weeks and aspirinindefinately following the procedure , and continued on his home regimenof captopril , metoprolol , isordil , digoxin , spironalactone , insulin ,lasix , zocor and prn nitroglycerin. groin sheaths were removed and thepatient was without hematoma or bruit. he had 2 episodes of chestpressure several hours following the procedure with negative ekg andstable vitals; the symptoms resolved with oxycodone and did not recur.on discharge he was ambulating confortably without chest pain or shortnessof breath.additional comments: please take your aspirin and plavix. the aspirin needs to be taken everyday on a long term basis , and the plavix must be taken for atleast 6weeks from 10/29discharge condition: stableto do/plan:please follow up with your cardiologist , dr. golaszewskiplease take your plavix 75mg for 6 weeks ( until atleast 3/12/06 )take your aspirin 325mg indefinatelyplease reschedule appointment with dr. kuick to receive steroidinjections for spinal stenosis until after your course of plavix iscompleteno dictated summaryentered by: yueh , earl d. , m.d.
