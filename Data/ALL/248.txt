ultrasound:impression: no renal or urinary bladder abnormalities.brief hospital course:35 year-old woman with mental retardation since childhoodpresenting with mental status changes, ataxia, poor po intake,and thrombocytopenia admitted with hypothermia, temperature 32c. she was initially admitted to the [hospital unit name 153] where she was warmed upto euthermia and subsequently transferred to the floor.surveillance for infections was negative.  psychiatry wasconsulted to assess for possible medication related symptoms.  aswollen lower lip and swollen tongue and shortness of breathprompted an eval by ent to r/o vocal cord edema. workup forangioedema was initiated.hypothermia: the duration of her hypothermia is unclear as shepreviously refused vital signs for weeks. her hypothermia couldhave been related to underlying mental retardation and inabilityto seek warmth or side effect from her antipsychoticmedications.  her core temperature increased to the lower rangeof normal after warming with bair hugger and receiving 2 litersof warmed saline in the er. she did not show evidence of septicphysiology.  slightly elevated tsh but normal t4 indicating sickeuthyroid but this is not the cause of the patients hypothermia.ataxia: she has had ataxia for approximately one month whichcould be an effect of hypothermia or related to her underlyingneurologic disease.  she had a head ct that did not show anyacute findings.  she continued to improve as an inpatient andwas walking independently (at her baseline) on her own prior todischargepoor oral intake: she had poor po intake at her group home andwas seen by speech and swallow who recommended soft solids andthin liquids with meds whole or crushed in puree. her mentalstatus improved and she was able to take regular diet.poor urine output: she had poor urine output at group home, butafter foley placement she had 1200cc urine output. this may bedue to a medication side effect (she is on anticholinergics toprevent side effects from antipsychotics). also has had poororal intake recently.  after her foley was discontinued and shehad ongoing urinary retention that required intermittentcatheterization. urology was consulted and recommended scheduledintermittent catheterization and cystex tid. patient frequentlyrefuses catheterization, nurses have had better luck with thecatheterization about 1-2 hours after antipsychotics given. allanticholinergics were stopped, including cogentin, with someimprovement in her bladder volumes. it is unclear if there is abehavioral component to her urinary retention. her urinaryretention was of moderate volume and a bun / cr were stable(creatinine 0.7) on [11-2], she has outpt urology appt scheduled.given the urinary retention she is at risk for urinary tractinfections, the patient's group home staff was informed of signsof a uti such as delerium / agitation / other behavioral changesor urinary changes (frequency/odor) which should prompt referralto a physician for workup of uti.rash: she was seen by dermatology who confirmed with scrapingsthat it was fungal.  patient has been on fluconazole for thisand dermatology recommended swithcing to topical terbinafinewhich improved her tinea corporis significantly. she will followup with dermatology in [2139-12-30].mental retardation and agitation:  her home psychiatricmedications were continued including a slightly lower doserisperdal, at 5mg po bid. the psychiatric consultants felt thatgiven the patient's behavior has returned to baseline it may bebest to avoid transition to clozaril as previously discussedgiven the greater propensity for anticholinergic side effectsand that if behavioral issues and agitation issues do ariseperhaps increasing the dose of risperdal should be the firststep in management rather than an alternative anti-psychotic.sick euthyroid: mild tsh elevation to 7.7 with normal free t4.this should be repeated as an outpatient to screen forhypothyroidism.thrombocytopenia: this could be a side effect of her numerouspsychiatric medications or fluconazole. this remained stableduring her hospital stay and subsequently improved to normal.inflammation: she had an elevated esr and crp of unclearetiology, very non-specific. [doctor first name ] was negative. considerrepeating these in [1-31] months after discharge.in regards to returning to normal activity she is cleared toreturn to her workshop and other normal daily activities as ofdate of discharge, [2139-11-3].medications on admission:- minerin dry skin cream- multivitamin daily- zyrtec 10mg qam- hydroxyzine 50mg [hospital1 ]- fluconazole 150mg daily- risperidone 5mg [hospital1 ]- benztropine 1mg tid- inderal 30mg tid- ambien 5mg qhs (started [2139-10-16])- luvox was discontinued in [month (only) 216]discharge medications:1. miconazole nitrate 2 % powder sig: one (1) appl topical [hospital1 ](2 times a day) as needed for fungal infection: apply to underbreasts, until rash resolves.2. terbinafine 1 % cream sig: one (1) appl topical [hospital1 ] (2 timesa day): apply until rash resolves, then for an additional [1-31]weeks.disp:qs tube refills:23. propranolol 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po tid (3times a day).4. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day) as needed for constipation.disp:60 capsule(s) refills:25. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday) as needed for constipation.disp:60 tablet(s) refills:06. bisacodyl 10 mg suppository sig: one (1) suppository rectaldaily (daily) as needed for constipation: use if colace andsenna are ineffective.disp:10 suppository(s) refills:27. risperidone m-tab 1 mg tablet, rapid dissolve sig: five (5)tablet, rapid dissolve po bid (2 times a day): please dispense5mg tabs if available or equivalent dosing.disp:300 tablet, rapid dissolve(s) refills:2discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:hypothermiaagitationurinary retentiondischarge condition:mental status: confused - sometimes.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:you were admitted to the hospital for low body temperature. thisimproved with warming in the icu. this may have been due to yourantipsychotic medications. you also developed some agitation inthe hospital and it was felt that you may benefit from anadjustment in your psychiatric medications. you had some urinaryretention, also likely due to medications which requiredintermittent catheterization.  this problem has improvedsomewhat but you should still see a urologist, this appointmenthas been made for you.followup instructions:department: surgical specialtieswhen: wednesday [2139-12-2] at 2:30 pmwith: [first name8 (namepattern2) 161] [name6 (md) 162] [name8 (md) 163], md [telephone/fax (1) 921]building: [hospital6 29] [location (un) ]campus: east     best parking: [hospital ward name 23] garageplease follow up with your primary care physician [name initial (pre) 176] 4 weeksof your discharge from the hospital.please follow up with your psychiatrist within 4 weeks of yourdischarge from the hospital.
