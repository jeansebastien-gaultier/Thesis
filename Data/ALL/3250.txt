with a history of non-smallcelllung ca (stage iiia, s/p chemo, xrt, and l upper lobectomy), pe35 yrs ago, rheumatic fever in childhood, prior tobacco use whopresents with headache, nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and blurryvision for the last 2 weeks. she reports a holocephalicheadache,extending from the back of her head up to the front bilaterallystarting about 2 weeks ago. the headache is constant, notthrobbing, and worsens with any movement particularly when shestands up. it does not seem to worsen with lying down and hasnotwoken her from sleep. she says she used to get migraines but hasnot had one in years; thinks this headahce feels somewhatsimilarbut is atypical in its duration. in addition she has hasworsening nausea with vomiting, and for the last two days hasnotbeen able to keep anything down. she has also noticed that hervision appears "cloudy" over the last week and a half. uponfurther questioning she says she thinks it appears doublesometimes but is unsure if the images are vertically orhorizontally displaced. she has not tried covering one eye toseeif it improves. she is not sure if it is worse when lookingtoward one direction or the other. currently her vision seems alittle blurry but denies diplopia at the moment.within the last two days she has also begun to experiencedizziness, which she describes as the room spinning. she hasalsohad difficulty walking and says she feels very unsteady on herfeet. unsure if she is falling toward one side or the other. shecame into the ed today because she was continuing to feel worseand was unable to keep down anything by mouth.on neuro ros, the pt reports headache, blurred/double vision,vertigo, difficulty walking as above. denies difficultyspeaking,loss of vision, focal weakness, numbness/tingling,
