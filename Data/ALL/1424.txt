left kidney pain &quot; .this patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of dep therapy for pulmonary involvement .in the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .in early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in february of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and adriamycin for six cycles .in 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .in early 2000 he was started on therapy with taxol per dr. azel hibbskays and finished this in march of this year .ct imaging at that time was negative for disease .in april of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .thereafter he began chemotherapy with taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the pointexasp region general hospital on 06/16/00 .that hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .he was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( tpa ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight heparin .it was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to pre health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .mr. pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .as well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to &quot;
