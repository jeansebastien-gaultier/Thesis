from leptomeningeal involvement and hemorrhagic brainmetastases with contributions from over-sedation from homebenzodiazepines, pna and uti. on admission to the icu patientwas quite sedated and only minimally responsive. across his stayhe became more responsive and was able to follow commands, moveall extremities, and at times speak quite coherently, althoughhis mental status continued to wax and wane. during hishospitalization he also developed a left sided facial droopthought likely due to evolving brain metastases andleptomeningeal involvement.2. goals of care/code status: the patient code status was madednr/dni during this admission and this was confirmed with thepatient's wife. a family meeting was held to discuss goals ofcare, and it was decided to move towards hospice care
