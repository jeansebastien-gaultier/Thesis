infarction .associated diagnosis :1. coronary artery disease ,2. unstable angina ( postmyocardial infarction angina ) ,3. parkinson 's disease .special procedures and operations :1. percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary atherectomy of the left anterior descending , 8-17-93 ,2. relook coronary angiogram , 08-18-93 .doctors discharge orders and medications on discharge :ecotrin 1 tablet po qd , captopril 6.25 mg po tid , k-dur 20 meq. po qd , lasix 20 mg po qd , isordil 10 mg po tid , sinemet 1/2 tablet po bid , symmetrel 100 mg po bid , parloder 2.5mg po qd .history of present illness :the patient is a 58 year old female with a history of parkinson 's disease for more than twenty years who presented to the gemenadentoolpai medical center with a revolving anterolateral wall myocardial infarction on 08-01-93 .she has been under the care of dr. aalv manual and was referred here for further therapy .she had no prior significant cardiac history and presented to her local medical doctor 's office with an episode of severe retrosternal chest pain .her electrocardiogram showed a new right bundle branch block and left anterior hemiblock .the patient was transferred to the gemenadentoolpai medical center and was admitted .her hospital course was remarkable for ruling in for a myocardial infarction with a peak cpk of 9,379 units with a 5.9% mb fraction .in addition , on telemetry she developed complete heart block and hypotension requiring temporary pacing wire and then a permanent pacemaker implantation on 08-03-93 .she developed congestive heart failure and required pressor support .she underwent cardiac catheterization on 8-15-93 and was found to have a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 28 millimeters of mercury .she had a dominant right coronary artery with minor disease .the main left coronary artery had a 20% stenosis .the left anterior descending had a severe 80% proximal stenosis with a filling defect consistent with intraluminal thrombus .the circumflex artery had a minor 40% stenosis .cine left ventriculogram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an area of anterolateral , apical , and septal akinesis .the left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to 38% .the patient was transferred to the heaonboburg linpack grant medical center for consideration of coronary angioplasty .cardiac risk factors :her risk factors for coronary artery disease included a positive family history and an elevated cholesterol level .past medical history :her past medical history is remarkable for a history of parkinson 's disease .physical examination :her physical examination at the time of admission revealed a pleasant lady in no acute distress .the blood pressure was 120/70 millimeters of mercury .her pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute .the jugular venous pressure was elevated at 6 cm above the sternal angle .the carotids were normal .the chest was clear .the cardiac examination revealed anapical impulse in the fifth left intercostal space , left to mid clavicular line .the first sound was normal .the second sound was normally split .she had no murmurs and no gallops .the examination the abdomen was benign .the examination of the extremities showed no edema .she had good pulses bilaterally .laboratory data :her electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm , left atrial enlargement , left axis deviation , poor r-wave progression in v1 through v4 , consistent with marked clockwise rotation , cannot rule out an old anteroseptal wall myocardial infarction .there were prominent q-waves in avl , consistent with lateral myocardial infarction .there were non-specific st-t wave abnormalities .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the medical service .the patient was seen in consultation by the neurology department because of the history of parkinson 's disease .the patient was maintained on intravenous heparin .on 8-17-93 , she was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where she underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending .following balloon angioplasty , there was a local dissection with evidence of intraluminal thrombus , with a greater than 10% loss in the initial gain following coronary angioplasty .therefore , directional coronary atherectomy was performed with an excellent angiographic outcome , and a less than 10% residual narrowing .the patient tolerated the procedure well .she was maintained on intravenous heparin and was brought back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on 08-18-93 for a relook coronary angiography .coronary angiography demonstrated ongoing benefit of the initial coronary atherectomy .specifically , there was no decrease in the initial gain that she achieved after directional atherectomy .the patient remained stable during the rest of the hospitalization .she was transferred in stable condition to the pasi for further rehabilitation therapy .renlan fyfezeis , m.d.dr. aalv lorjes salv manual pasitr :jb / bmotdd :9-17-93td :09/19/93cc :
