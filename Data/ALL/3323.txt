state of health at 2300. her partner heard her thrashingin bed at 0130 and at that time, he noted her speech to beslurred and her left side to be weak, though apparently stillable to move. as it seems that the thrashing likely was aroundthe time of onset of the stroke, we considered 0130 to be thelast known well time. she was initially taken to osh, where shehad a ct head that was negative for hemorrhage; it was theredetermined that she was "out of the tpa window" and she wastransferred to [hospital1 18] for further care.full ros unable to be obtained as patient very agitated andseemingly

hospital course:initial assessment:ms. [known lastname 104742] is a 49 y/o woman with a pmh significant formyelodysplastic syndrome, htn and hypothyroidism, who presentswith sudden onset left sided weakness. on her exam, her nihss is17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as rightgaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect. her imaging showsanocclusion of r mca near its origin. her history, exam andimagingare consistent with acute embolic stroke in r mca. the time ofonset was taken to be 0130; the time of her thrashing, and sowhen she was seen here, she remained within the window for ivtpa. the decision was made to proceed with the iv tpa. the planat this time is to proceed with tpa infusion and if clinicalexamremains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed withangio for ia tpa vs. merci.neuro:ms. [known lastname 104742] was admitted to the neurology icu, attending dr.[last name (stitle) ].there was no improvement with tpa, and she developed hematomasof the right knee, left scalp, and left clavicular area, so ivtpa was stopped. the team proceeded with angio and merci devicewas used. this resulted in opening of inferior division of theright mca, but opening of the superior division wasunsuccessful.  she was monitored in the icu and then wastransferred to the step down unit, then to the floor for furthermanagement. she was started on aspirin 81mg and lovenox 40mgdaily (given possible mds/malignancy.)  her ct scans showedhemorrhagic conversion in the right striatum and white matter.an mri was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this.there was no need to attempt repeating this mri, per dr.
