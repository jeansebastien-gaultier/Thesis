[first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (namepattern1) ]thought it looked like a penetrating atherosclerotic plaque thathad ulcerated and that it was only covered by a very thin aorticwall and thus was at risk for rupture. he underwent a stentgraft repair of this in [2151-11-14]. follow-up ct scan hasshown an endoleak with expanding pseudoaneurysm into his aorticarch. given his endoleak and expanding psuedoaneurysm, it hasbeen decided to return to the operating room for repair.past medical history:- pseudoaneurysm of aortic arch and endoleak- coronary artery disease- copd- hyperlipidemia- hypertension- calcified aorta- new finding of left lingula lung mass- bilateral pleural effusions- hypothyroidism- trauma to lower extremities- emphysema- past myocardial infarction [11/2137]- trauma from fall with multiple broken bones- s/p coronary artery bypass grafting surgeryx5 in [2137] - [hospital3 ] dr.
