on 6/87 stress test (medically managed) who was feeling well until last night.  during the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  in the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 sl tng 5 mins apart.  he denies sob, n/v, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  he states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single sl tng within 10-15 mins.  the arm pain is not exertional.	after the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  a couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  after vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  he had a bowel movement this am which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  he denies brbpr, abdominal pain, cp, sob, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.	in the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ed this morning.  admission vitals: 97.2, 120/78, hr 80's, rr12, sats 97% ra.  he was noted to be in a fib.  hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).  ng lavage was not performed in the ed.  however, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by sl tng x 3.  hr at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ecg showed a fib with possible twi in i,l and v6 but relatively unchanged from admission ecg without pain.  he subsequently received lopressor 2.5
