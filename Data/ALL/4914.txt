bp 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions. denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.when daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or icu level care. she does add that patient was at levi hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221;
