drugsattending:[first name3 (lf) 618]chief complaint:headachemajor surgical or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:49 year-old man with a history of bipolar/schizoaffectivedisorder, hypothyroidism, recent admission to osh with ha whowas transferred with recurrent ha, nausea and new left parietalhemorrhage.at admission, patient was found to be a poor historian and muchof the history was apparently taken from medical records per oshand the pt's sister.per sister, pt first presented to pcp [last name (namepattern4) ] [11-29] with ~8-9 days ofnearly daily headache, nausea and vomiting. she was unable toprovide details of headache. pcp arranged for head ct which wasnormal, and pt sent home. sister accompanied him home, andrealized that pt having difficulty with tasks such as dialingphone or using spoon. normally pt lives alone, and sister felthe was unsafe so brought him to [hospital3 1443] hospital,where he was admitted from [date range (1) 65003]. while there, he had mrithat per osh discharge summary showed small bilateral strokes inpostrior parietal parasaggital region near the parieto-occipitalfissure, thought to be watershed however this was not observed.also in differential was possible viral meningoencephalitis.stroke workup with negative carotid us, echo, normal lipids anda1c, no arrythmias. he was started on asa. on discharge he hadfull strength, was still having difficulty making phone calls.headache had improved, though not fully resolved. sister reportsthat he was getting percocet in hospital, though he was notdischarged with any.since discharge, sister reports that pt complaining of slowlyworsening headache. also has been complaining of trouble seeing,"i can't see the kitchen sink." he saw his pcp yesterday whothought headaches might be migraines, and gave him zomig. todaythe headache worsened and pt returned to osh ed. head ct showedleft parieto-occipital bleed and pt transferred for furthermanagement.per sister and brother-in-law, pt "does ok on all your tests,but he still has trouble functioning, such as trouble gettingdressed." at baseline (prior to recent headaches) pt did havesome cognitive difficulties, and some trouble articulating. heis worse now, but it is not entirely clear the time course ofthis. the trouble making phone calls is definitely new. also ofnote, he has had some recent med changes after psychhospitalization at [hospital1 ] ~3 months ago. also, while at osh ptrefused risperdal and was started on seroquel instead.currently, pt reports vertex headache, am unable to get any moredetails. also reports +nausea, trouble talking and troubleseeing. no chest pain, abdominal pain. notes some left legweakness as well.social history:lives alone, is own guardian. sister had been his guardian inthe past but apparently a court has determined that she is nolonger allowed to hold this position.family history:sister with mental illness.physical exam:admission physicalbp

[1-8]: there has been evolution of the previously notedblood products in the left parieto-occipital region, overallunchanged in extent in the interval. however, new in theinterval is hypodensity in the left internal capsule andthalamus, which is exerting slight mass effect on the frontal[doctor last name 534] of the left lateral ventricle. this is concerning for acuteor subacute infarction. no new intracranial hemorrhage or othernew suspicious areas of hypodensity are noted. there is nohydrocephalus. the basilar cisterns are visible. the mastoid aircells are opacified bilaterally. the remainder of the paranasalsinuses and the orbits are unremarkable..eeg [1-8]: impression: this is a mildly abnormal eeg due to thepresence of a focalarea of slowing in the left anterior quadrant suggestive of asubcortical abnormality in this region. background frequencieswerealso somewhat slower than normal, suggesting the presence of amildencephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology..cta neck [1-10]: 1. left internal jugular vein thrombosis asdescribed. question of left sigmoid sinus partial thrombosis,versus mixing artifact.2. mastoid and partial ethmoid and sphenoid

[known lastname 65004] is a 49 yo rhm with h/o bipolar/schizoaffectivedisorder, hypothyroidism, who was transferred with complaints ofheadache for about a month and nausea. upon admission he wasfound to have a large left parietal hemorrhage. the exam uponadmission was notable for inattention, anomia, right field cut,mild-moderate r hemiparesis, and perseveration..neuro:the patient was transferred to the neuro/icu  for telemetry andaggressive blood pressure control. neurosurgery evaluated himand no surgical intervention was necessary. his mri/mra scansrevealed a large (~40cc) hemorrhage near the [doctor last name 352]-white junctionin the left parietal lobe. there was no clear underlying massand there were no underlying vascular abnormalities per mra (noaneurysms/avm). an echo, to look for a cardio-embolic etiology,was negative (no valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi;no pfo/asd, but not with certainty as the image quality waspoor).mr [known lastname 65004] then developed a l thalamic infarct [1-8], and wasless alert, with increased r hemiparesis. an eeg ([1-8]) showedfocal slowing in the l anterior quadrant. a hemorrhagicconversion of the infract was then noted on [1-12] with someintraventricular blood (found incidentally when getting ctv).the ctv ([1-12]) showed a l superior sagittal sinus thrombosisand ?l sigmoid sinus thrombosis  with extension into theinternal jugular vein. a repeat head ct [1-14], showed noevidence of hydrocephalus, and no further blood in 4thventricle.mr. [known lastname 65004] was started on anticoagulation with lovenox on [1-13].he was also given a short course of diamox for l hemisphereedema. neurosurg was re-consulted to monitor the hemorrhage intothe 4th ventricle given the risk of hydrocephalus. nointervention was necessary. follow up ct-head series showed astable picture..psychiatry:the patient was maintained on seroquel. depakote wasdiscontinued, and lithium was started [1-6]. lithium levelsshould be monitored closely (every 2 weeks) and the dosingshould be adjusted accordingly. the patient has been closelyfollowed by the psychiatry service. please contact dr. [last name (stitle) 65005],[numeric identifier 65006] if any questions arise. close follow up will bearranged. haldol was given on a prn basis..cardiovascular:an echo showed an ef>55%. the patient was ruled out for an mi[1-8]. goal sbp<160. lipids profile was within normal limits.ekg should be checked if the patient receives haldol on aregular basis (risk for prolonged qt)..fen/gi:-cardiac prudent diet.hematology:the patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic w/nadir in 80s,likely secondary to depakote. plt normalized after depakote wasdiscontinued.as part of a workup related to the sinus thrombosis thefollowing tests were done:-no le dvt on [1-11] u/s.-hypercoagulable workup: fibrinogen 482, d-dimer 2938.homocysteine wnl, [doctor first name ] neg, lupus anticoagulant neg, atiii wnl,fvl neg. prot c slightly low 63, prot s elevated (?acute phasereactant). factor viii and anticardiolipin normal. prothrombingene mutation pending. please resend hypercoag workup again inthe future if pt ever comes off anticoagulation.the patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as he isnot a coumadin candidate. lovenox level 2.0 on [1-26], after whichthe dose was decreased; level on [2-1]: 1.06; level on [2-3]: 0.9(i.e. within goal range)..other:the patient has had multiple falls [12-31], [1-5], [1-6] x2, allsecondary to orthostasis, a r field cut, and impulsivity. pleasecheck orthostatics in case the patient is unsteady..endocrine:-tsh 3.4; levoxyl was continued. please continue to monitor.-hba1c 5.2, no intervention needed..id:on cipro [date range (1) 14813] for e. coli uti. ua on [2-2] was negative..ent:sinus opacification upon admission. this has resolved. ifpatient becomes symptomatic he will need ent follow up..legal: mr [known lastname 65004] has a legal guardian since [1-30].
