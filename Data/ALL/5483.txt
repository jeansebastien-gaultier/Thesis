thegastroenterologist and the general surgeons , the patient wasthought to have abdominal pain secondary to gastroparesis giventhe findings on the egd and ct as well as the negative ultrasoundand kub. the gastroparesis was thought to be secondary to hisdiabetes. he was admitted to the medical service and his dietwas slowly increased. on the floor , his pain continued , andwithin two to three days , he began spiking fevers to 101 to 102.he had a repeat abdominal ct , which showed a distendedgallbladder with circumferential wall thickening and extensivestranding of the pericholecystic fat , which represented acuteacalculous cholecystitis. surgery was reconsulted , and thepatient was taken to the operating room where he had anexploratory laparoscopy , which was then converted to an opencholecystectomy for gangrenous cholecystitis. the patientreceived perioperative vancomycin , levaquin , and flagyl andcontinued to do well post surgery with advancement of his dietand decrease in his pain medication requirement. vancomycin wasdiscontinued on 4/14/2006 after six days of vancomycin. he wascontinued on the levaquin and flagyl. he had a drain that wasleft in following surgery ,

bileleak.endocrine: the patient was continued on lower-dose insulin whilehe was n.p.o. and this was titrated up as his diet increased.cardiovascular: the patient was followed by the cardiactransplant team. he was initially switched to iv cyclosporineand his cellcept was held. these were transitioned to p.o. andrestarted following his improvement. postoperatively , he gotstress-dose hydrocortisone instead of his prednisone and this wasthen tapered to solu-medrol and then back to prednisone at hishome dose. he was fluid overloaded following the surgery. hegot 100 of iv lasix times several doses , and then restarted onhis torsemide to maintain euvolemia. his cartia was initiallydiscontinued for a question of contribution to gastroparesis , butthis was then restarted. he was discharged on all his homemedications with the torsemide at a dose of 40 mg q.a.m.rheumatology: following his surgery , he developed bilateralelbow pain , which was thought to be likely secondary to gout.the

his gout improved. he was dischargedwithout any elbow pain.phlebitis: he developed left arm phlebitis secondary to aninfiltrating iv. this was covered by his antibiotics that werestarted for his
