placementof vp shunt presented [1-24] with fever and rash. on [1-2]patient had left hemiplegia and ha, was diagnosed with ich frommetastatic melanoma.  underwent emergent craniotomy forevacuation of bleed and tumor rescetion, she was also started ondilantin for seizure prophylaxis. she then developedhydrocephalus and had vp shunt placed on [1-6] and repeat vpshunt operation on [1-14] secondary to her failure at clampingtrials. prior to discharge she was noted to be febrile to 103 on[11-13] temp spiked to 101.5 with a productive cough,influenza was negative so she was discharged on levofloxacin,completed course [1-21]. three sets of blood cultures and urineculture negative.  she also developed a diffuse morbiliformeruption rash after dilantin was started.  however, dilantin wascontinued since the benefits of sizure prophylaxis outweighedrisks of continuing medicaitons.  after discharge her feverresolved but the rash did not.  she used sarna lotion andbenadryl at home, but noted spread of the rash from truckoutwards to extremities, sparing face palms and soles..on day of admission ([1-23]) she developed a high fever withchills and was brought to [hospital3 3583], and was thentransfered here for further care.  upon arrival to the ed thepatient recieved 125 mgsolumedrol, 50 mg iv benadryl, 1 gram tylenol, motrin 800 mg and4 liters of normal saline. her fever initially was >104.8rectally (107 temporal) but trended down to 99.1.  got cxr,cultures, urine and shunt tapped.  id was consulted whorecommended holding on abx given lack of source, did not feelthat vp fluid cell count was indicative of shunt infection, morelikely blood.  dermatology was also consulted.past medical history:- malignant melanoma w/ metastases to brain s/p ich evacuationand ip shunt
