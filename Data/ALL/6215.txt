[known lastname 25006] is a 72 year old female with stage iiiacarcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage i mucinous carcinoma ofthe ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents withhypotension.# hypotension - etiology remained unclear. differentialdiagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [3-18] cellulitis of le's, butwithout other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (butappeared volume overloaded on exam), chf with 3rd spacing ofvolume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication(chemotherapy) side effect.  differential also includedpericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by tte. withtreatment of chf (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and ofcellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's bp improve.antihypertensives held during hospitalization and on discharge.appears patient's baseline sbp is in the 90s. patient ambulatedwithout lightheadedness..# hypoxia - developed in osh ed after she received ivf for herhypotension; in the setting of as and hypertrophiccardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded. was voumeoverloaded on exam, with crackles, peripheral edema, weightelevation, bnp elevation. other possibilites include worseningof hocm, or worsened diffuse pulmonary metastasis as seen on ctin [2121-2-14] which may have further reduced pulmonaryreserve. with diuresis, patient's oxygen requirement resolved,albeit slowly. cta was done to rule out pe - negative for pe.patient ambulated without sob and without desaturation. in fact,spo2 improved with ambulation, so perhaps there was anatelectatic component (heard as crackles at the bases perhaps)that improved with opening up of airways upon ambulation..# cellulitis - bilateral erythema and warmth of lower legs onexam.  could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reactionto chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legspreviously when on this chemotherapy regimen). patient treatedwith vancomycin and then keflex. patient diuresed with lasixone-time doses..# acute renal failure - baseline creatinine around 1 and 1.0 on[4-10].  was 2.2 at osh and became 1.3 after getting iv hydration.seemed pre-renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w/ ivfluids; then patient was diuresed for chf/volume overloadconcern, and cr continued to improve down to 0.8..# tachycardic runs - appear to be svt (narrow complex, regular,no p waves, came on/off suddenly), seen intermittently andasymptomatic. ruled out pe with cta..# normocytic anemia - was 32.8 at osh; after receiving fluidshct has fallen further to 30. baseline is 35 - 40. notclinically bleeding. perhaps due to chemotherapy..# thrombocytopenia - 137 down from 700 earlier. likely  relatedto marrow suppression from chemotherapy..# asthma history?
