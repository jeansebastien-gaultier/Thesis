without bowel obstructionbrief hospital course:please note that pt left against medical advice..53 y/o immunosuppressed female s/p renal transplant in [month (only) 958][2172], presenting from pcp's office with three weeks of chills,now with documented fevers tachycardia, borderline hypotension,and hypoglycemia..1. sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia: on presentation, meetsirs criteria with fevers, tachycardia and mild bandemia fromsuspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression.pancultured in the emergency department and placed on empiricbroad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime.  toevaluate for etiology, cxr and ct scan of abdomen was performedwith no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in therectum.  urinalysis did have minimal blood and white bloodcells, but culture returned negative.  stool cx returnedpositive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.  blood cxfrom [10-5] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics weresubsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).  the mostlikely source of ecoli bacteremia was thought to betranslocation from gut in setting of mild colitis.  the patientwas transiently hypotensive in the emergency department, butresponded to fluid boluses.  with antibiotic therapy, shedefervesced, tachycardia resolved, and subjective complaints ofchills improved.  surveillance blood cx from [10-6] were negativefor 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developedleukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute toleukopenia) and changed to po vancomycin. authorization for povanco could not be obtained over the weekend and pt decided toleave against medical advice in lieu of waiting for vancoauthorization. pt was advised to continue vanco for 2 weeks moreafter completing 2 week course of cipro. she has outpt f/u intransplant clinic to have wbc count checked (in addition to inrand tacro levels, as below). at time of discharge, pt wasabebrile >72 hrs, had no diarrhea, no abd pain, no n/v. of note,mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued as well prior todischarge given leukopenia. bactrim and valcyte, though also cancause leukopenia, were continued as pt has been on these for along time without complications. most likely leukopenia was dueto recent initiation of flagyl, and should improve oncipro/vanco regimen.  mmf was held until follow up as this mayhave been contributing to her neutropenia..2. esrd s/p transplant: history of lupus nephritis s/p renaltransplant on cellcept, tacrolimus and prednisone.  baselinecreatinine is in the 1s, but has been slowly increasing since[month (only) 205] and has been as high as 2.7 in the recent past.  etiologyof developping renal insufficiency is unclear: ct scan with noevidence of obstruction, urinalysis without active sediment tosuggest recurrent lupus nephritis.  the patient may have chronicvolume depletion, she is on bactrim for pcp [name9 (pre) ] which mayartifactually increase creatinine.  also, it is unclear whethershe is compliant with her immunosuppressants at home.  a renalbiopsy may be pursued as an outpatient.  during hospitalization,renal function was trended daily and patient continued onimmunosuppressants with bactrim for pcp [name initial (pre) ].  daily tacrolimuslevels were also followed with level adjusted as needed. goallevel [7-20], tacro level 6.4 at discharge, per renal consultcontinued 2mg [hospital1 ] dosing of tacrolimus. cellcept wasdiscontinued prior to discharge given leukopenia (as above). pthas f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levelsrechecked and to check wbc count, will modulateimmunosuppression regimen based on those results..3. antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation withwarfarin for history of apls (anticardiolipin ab's showingelevated igg and normal igm in [3-17] and [7-17]) with multipleprior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula. pt/inr followeddaily with warfarin supratherapeutic on [10-6] to 4.7.  inr at2.9 to 2.1 on discharge (goal [1-13]). coumadin was restarted at1mg daily with f/u day after discharge to check inr levels andto adjust coumadin accordingly..4.  sle: outpatient rheumatology notes

with last documented [doctor first name ]positive 1:160 in [2169], though dsdna ab's have been negativewhen checked since [2171].  no findings on history or physicalconsistent with lupus flair..5.  hypertension: pt has history of hypertension treated withmetoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurementsdocumented in the 110-140 range, per omr. documented bp's in edgenerally in low 100s, with ivf infusion.  given systemic htn,home metoprolol initially held but restarted prior to discharge..6. hyperlipidemia: last lipid panel in [2172-9-10], with tc144, hdl 39, ldl 81, tg 120. not currently receiving treatment,but was taking simvastatin through [2172-3-11]..7. hyponatremia: mild, without alterations in mental status.likely poor po intake over past days-weeks would
