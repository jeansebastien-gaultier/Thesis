two metaphase cells were obtained and analyzed fromthis specimen. this limited/ incomplete study may not ruleout mosaicism at a level that is standard for such ananalysis. two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome8 (trisomy 8) and a translocation of chromosomes 15 and17. this translocation is associated with pml-rara fusionand is a characteristic finding in acute promyelocytic(m3) leukemia.----------------interphase fish analysis, 100-300cells-------------------nuc ish(pml,rara)x3(pml con rarax2)[89/100]fish evaluation for a pml-rara rearrangement was performedon nuclei with the lsi pml/rara dual color, dual fusiontranslocation probe ([doctor last name 7594] molecular) for pml at 15q22and rara at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as abnormal.rearrangement was observed in 89/100 nuclei, which exceedsthe normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for thisprobe in our laboratory. a pml-rara rearrangement isfound in most acute promyelocytic leukemias (fab m3).this test was developed and its performancedetermined by the [hospital1 18] cytogenetics laboratoryas required by the clia '[25] regulations. it has notbeen cleared or approved by the u.s. food and drugadministration. this test is used for clinicalpurposes.flow cytometry:results:three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. cd45) tooptimize blast yield.abnormal cells comprise 82% of total gated events.b-cells comprise 6% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal,and do not express aberrant antigens.t-cells comprise 57% of lymphoid-gated events, express maturelineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of1.04 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0).cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cellsisolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associatedantigens (cd13, cd33 (bright), cd15 (bright, subset), expresscd64, cd71, lack b and t cell associated antigens, are cd10(callaa) negative, and are negative for cd34, hla-dr, cd14,cd41,

correlation with concurrentcytogenetic findings is recommended for furthercharacterization..imaging:echocardiogram [2148-9-20]conclusionsthe left atrium is elongated. left ventricular wall thicknessesare normal. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. due tosuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormalitycannot be fully excluded. there is moderate to severe globalleft ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (theanterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing morehypokinetic than the other walls) (lvef = 30 %). rightventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wallhypokinesis. the aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinuslevel. the ascending aorta is moderately dilated. the aorticvalve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leafletexcursion and no aortic regurgitation. the mitral valve leafletsare mildly thickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. mild(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the pulmonary artery systolicpressure could not be determined. there is no pericardialeffusion.compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)of [2146-5-26], contractile function of both ventricles is nowsignificantly reduced.ct head w/o contrast   [2148-9-23] 6:31 pmimpression: large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the rightfrontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local masseffect. a hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component isalso seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additionalnon-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellarhemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. given themultifocality of these lesions, and history of malignancy, thesemay represent metastases with associated hemorrhage. analternate consideration is multiple infarctions, somehemorrhagic, likely embolic. mri with and without contrast wouldbe helpful for further evaluation.mri brain    [2148-9-24] 3:27 pmconclusion: multiple acute areas of infarction, many withhemorrhage. thedistribution suggests emboli from a proximal source, most likelycardiac.5-6 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. the location ofthehemorrhages does not imply prior bleeding from this aneurysm.within the limits of an adequate but not optimal mraexamination, no otherintracranial vascular abnormalities are detected.echocardiogram   [2148-9-25] at 1:30:32 pm   conclusions:no spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the leftatrium or left atrial appendage. no mass/thrombus is seen in theleft atrium or left atrial appendage. no spontaneous echocontrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. no atrialseptal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2d, colordoppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. left ventricular wallthicknesses and cavity size are normal. there is mild regionalleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior hypokinesis.no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. rvhypokinesis is seen. there are complex (>4mm) atheroma in theaortic arch. there are simple atheroma in the descendingthoracic aorta. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildlythickened. no masses or vegetations are seen on the aorticvalve. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valveleaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valveprolapse. there is small vegetation (4mm) on the mitral valveattached to the posterior leaflet on the

doppler son[name (ni) ] of right subclavian vein wasperformed andshows normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. grayscaleand doppler son[name (ni) ] of left subclavian, left internal jugular,left axillary, left brachial, left basilic, and left cephalicveins were performed. the left internal jugular vein showsnormal flow and augmentation.there is abnormal flow in the left subclavian vein, leftaxillary vein, and left basilic vein. hypoechoic foci consistentwith clots are also clearly visualized in the left basilic andleft axillary veins. these findings are consistent with an upperextremity thrombus in the left subclavian vein, left axillaryvein, and left basilic vein.brief hospital course:66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a newdiagnosis of apml and nstemi with ef 30%, s/p intubation [9-20]with extubation on [9-27], found to have large iph, multiplestrokes, and endocarditis.# apml: mr. [known lastname 104371] was diagnosed with apml by peripheral smear,flow cytometry, and pcr of the blood. he was treated with atraand hydroxyurea initially and when his wbc was <10k, hishydroxyurea was stopped. he also received steroids initially forprophylaxis of atra syndrome and this was gradually weaned. hewas monitored for tumor lysis and dic and transfused bloodproducts prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and inr <1.5. hisplatelet goal was initially 20k but this was increased to 100kafter his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.# nstemi with new heart failure (ef 35%): mr. [known lastname 104371] initiallypresented to his pcp's office with chest pain. he had elevatedtroponins on admission with no st or t wave changes on ekg, c/wnstemi. we trended his troponins which plateaued at 3.50. hisfirst echo showed moderate to severe global left ventricularhypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum,anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than theother walls) and lvef = 30 %. he was monitored on telemetry andhad no significant arrhythmias. given his concurrent iph (seebelow), antiplatelet & anticoagulant agents are contraindicatedand he was medically managed with nitrates, beta-blockers,low-dose ace-i and a statin. repeat echo on [2148-9-25] showed apersistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex,non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional lvsystolic dysfunction (ef 45%).# intraparenchymal hemorrhage: on the morning of [2148-9-23], itwas noted that mr.
