record date: 2079-07-21pontiac internal medicine associates          sherman, andrew                                              7-21-79   history of present illness:  mr. sherman is a patient well known to me.  i have seen him on multiple occasions for his coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes.  the patient has had a positive exercise tolerance test recently and was seen by cardiology who felt that he should undergo cardiac catheterization.  however, patient was overweight and the decision was made for him to reduce his weight by approximately 50 lb. at which time he would be suitable for cardiac catheterization on the pontiac equipment.  patient was seen last night in the pontiac emergency room with a several day history of back pain which began in the middle of his back and has subsequently become right flank pain which is persistent and colicky in nature.   on exam in the emergency room he was noted to be afebrile.  his exam was notable for cva tenderness and an exam highly suspicious of renal colic.  his ekg was unremarkable and his laboratory exam was unremarkable as well.  his urinalysis did not demonstrate any red blood cells, however, did have 3+ uric acid crystals with a normal uric acid blood level.  an abdominal ultrasound was ordered which was unremarkable except for the presence of his slight abnormality in the right pole of a kidney.  ivp was recommended by the radiologist for follow-up.  he was given toradol in the emergency room with minimal improvement and sent home with some motrin with the follow-up to be by me in internal medicine clinic.  i was called by the patient this morning complaining of worsening pain in his right flank.  on it, patient states he is unable to get out of bed and was brought to the pontiac state hospital to my internal medicine clinic.  on exam he was afebrile and his exam was notable for a right cva tenderness with pain radiating around to his abdomen and exacerbated by pushing on his abdomen.  patient has good bowel sounds throughout and there are no peritoneal signs. assessment and plan:  while i am concerned about his possible renal pathology i believe that there is a significant chance that this may be musculoskeletal in nature, however, due to his other medical problems i feel that an intravenous pyelogram is definitely indicated and he will undergo this study this afternoon.  i have also sent off a repeat cbc with differential, a repeat urinalysis and amylase and lipase levels to rule out pancreatitis.  of note, patient does have a history of peptic ulcer disease, however, he was guaiac negative in the emergency room and reports no episodes of hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.  he is also status post cholecystectomy.  i will review his ivp later today and make further therapeutic interventions at that time.  _________________________michael holman, m.d. ae:jp:5824:dd:7-21-79:dt:7-24-79dv:7-21-79
