sessions/uremia. it ispossible the tylenol with codeine she was taking for postoperative pain control contributed.  the morning followingadmission she had an episode of decreased responsiveness, clonicjerks, lip smacking and hand automatisms. she was evaluated byneurology and was given ativan and depakote for complex partialseizure. approximately 1 hour after this she became unresponsiveand her tongue was swollen.  she was intubated for airwayprotection due to angioedema. her mental status normalized(thought to be related to post-ictal state and medications), eegwas negative for status epilepticus, head ct and toxicologyscreens were negative.  the patient required daily dialysis from[date range (3) 45315] and her mental status normalized and was stablefor several days at discharge.2. angioedema/respiratory failure: her tongue was noted to beswollen prior to the administration of depakote duringsuctioning prior to intubation.  the angioedema seemed tocorrelate with the ativan administration. there is a report ofangioedema in the past, attributed to dilantin--but she receivedativan at that time as well.  she was treated for 24 hours withsteroids with remarkable improvement.  her lisinopril was alsodiscontinued.  her intubation was for airway protection in thesetting of altered mental status and angioedema. she hadpersistent apneic episodes on the ventilator and never developeda cuff leak. she has presumed tracheal stenosis from priortracheostomy.  she was successfully extubated in the presence ofanesthesia on [2122-9-25].  it is recommended she have an outpatientsleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea as well asan outpatient allergy evaluation.3. seizures: the patient suffered a partial complex seizure onthe morning after admission.  the neurology team followed thepatient throughout her admission.she was initially loaded with depakote, however, this was thentapered off and her [date range 13401] dosing was increased to 500 mg twicedaily and an additional dose following hemodialysis. she willfollow up with neurology as an outpatient.4. esrd on hd: she missed two outpatient hd sessions prior toadmission.  she was dialyzed daily in the micu from [date range (1) 45316]then returned to her scheduled of t/t/saturday.5. atrial fibrillation: rate control with metoprolol. she had asingle episode of rvr in the ed prior to admission whichresponded to labetalol, otherwise, she was effectively ratecontrolled.  her inr was subtherapeutic at admission, but wastherapeutic at discharge.  her inr will need to be followed inrehabilitation and outpatient monitoring set up prior todischarge home.6. abdominal pain: likely post operative, waxed and waned onthis admission.  at the time of discharge, the pain wascontrolled by tylenol.  her staples were removed by the surgicalteam during this hospitalization.  she had increased dischargefrom her abdominal wound noted on [2122-9-28]. the surgery teamevaluated and felt the wound was healing well and there was noevidence of a wound infection. they recommended daily drydressing changes.7. benign hypertension: continued on amlodipine and metoprolol.lisinopril discontinued in the setting of angioedema and notrestarted. the amlodipine was started in its place. her bloodpressure ranged 110-140s/50-70s prior to discharge.8. disposition: the patient was discharged to a rehabilitationfacility.  she will benefit from a home safety evaluation andvisiting nurses to evaluate medication understanding/compliance.she requires inr monitoring.  as an outpatient, she should havean allergy evaluation for the recurrent angioedema as well as asleep study to evaluate sleep apnea.medications on admission:meds:1. metoprolol succinate 100 mg tablet sustained release 24 hr[date
