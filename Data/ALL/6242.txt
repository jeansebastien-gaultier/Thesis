[known lastname 111746] presented to the ed on [6-19] at [hospital3 ] for brbpr.  admission labs were notable for a hct of54.4 with wbc of 22.5. during his brief hospital course his hctcontinued to drop (to a low of 26) warranting a total of 3 prbctransfusions. the patient was evaluated by both the oncology andgastroenterology teams and a upper endoscopy was performed onhospital day 1 - notable for a large bleeding mass located inthe ge junction. biopsies were performed and given the highconcern for malignancy the patient was prepared for transfer to[hospital1 18] sicu for further management.  here, he was found to be hemodynamically stable.  hishematocrit dropped from 30.9 on [6-19] to 24.7 on [6-21], so he wastransfused a unit of prbcs.  his hematocrit stabilized and hewas transferred to the floor.  on [6-22], he underwent acolonoscopy to evaluate for a lower gi bleed given his initialpresentation.  the colonoscopy showed dark melenic-appearingstool in the whole colon and terminal ileum, non-bleedingdiverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, non-bleeding internalhemorrhoids, and otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum andterminal ileum.  he tolerated the procedure well.  on [6-23], thefoley was discontinued, but the patient failed to void andrequired reinsertion.  also, an endoscopic ultrasound wasattempted but failed due to patient agitation.  the patientapparently had an undocumented drug side effect of thelorazepam, which resulted in two code purples being called.throughout the entire time, the patients vital signs were withinnormal limits and stable, including oxygen saturation (once themeasurement was obtainable - originally the patient was refusingpulse ox).  the patient was discharged on [6-24] in stablecondition with a leg bag in place.  his daughter declined ouroffer to schedule him with a nearby urologist to follow up onthe leg bag because they live in [location (un) 5087].  she was informed thatit is very important, therefore, that he follow up with his pcpquickly to get a referral to a urologist in hindham to managethe leg bag.  mr.
