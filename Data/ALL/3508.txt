w/ known cad presenting with near syncopehpi:  83 y/o man w/ cad, (no stents), followed by dr. youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened saturday am). of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. he denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. when he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. he sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    after vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. ems was called, and upon arrival at the ed, he had another episode of diarrhea. at no point did he have chest pain. he did not lose consciousness. this felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. in general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. however, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. the only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. he has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. he denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. he has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. ed course:upon presentation to ed, hr 50, bp 141/62, 18, 99% ra, afebrile. given aspirin,

lesion. discharged from sdu on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ dr. youmans (who has followed since).2. syncope: admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker

certainly in someone with known cad, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, mi, with atypical features. however, his ekg is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. however, i think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. it is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. there is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.syncope: stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseatedadmit to telemetry and monitor overnighthas completed mi r/ocontinue asa, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters),
