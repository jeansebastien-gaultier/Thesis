[known lastname 59022] is a 50 year old female with questionable history ofalcohol abuse in the past, htn, cri with baseline 2.8, andnephrolithiasis, who was transfered from an outside hospitalwith fulminant liver and renal failure.  her current illnessbegan 3 weeks ago at which time she presented to an ed with urisymptoms and was given cough medicine.  she saw her pcp one weeklater with continued uri symptoms, and orthopnea, and wasprescribed zithromax, prednisone, and flonase.  she began tonote hematuria and numbness and weakness of her extremities.over the next week she developed abdominal pain, bloating,decreased urine output, fever, and chills, at which time shepresented again to the outside hospital.  there, she was foundto have markedly elevated transaminases, liver

[known lastname 59022] had a renal biopsy on day 6 of her admission.unfortunately there were only 5 glomeruli in the specimen, allglobally sclerosed.  the interstitium was severely fibrosed, andthere was tubular atrophy, all consistent with advanced injurythat could not be specified.post-biopsy she developed flank pain, and was noted to have ahematocrit drop from 31 to 25.  a ct of the abdomen demonstrateda moderate-sized perinephric hematoma.  she again received ffp,ddavp, and 2 u prbc.  her hematocrit stabilized and she had nofurther flank pain prior to discharge.her creatinine on discharge was still markedly above baseline at6.1, and she was exhibiting mild signs of volume overload(orthopnea, peripheral edema).  the renal team did not feel thatshe met criteria for urgent hemodialysis, however, and she wastherefore seen by the dialysis team and set up with outpatientfollow up for probable need for dialysis in the near future.  ofnote, her pth prior to discharge was 369 (up from 15 only a fewmonths prior).  she was also started on lasix at therecommendation of the renal team, with the hopes of improvingher fluid  balance and controlling her hypertension (see below).3) pneumonia:  at the outside hospital she had been found tohave a lll pna and was therefore already on levo/flagyl ontransfer.  these were continued to complete a 7 day course.  sheremained afebrile throughout her course.  her wbc was elevatedon admission, however this was felt to be related to the acuteliver injury, and trended down throughout the admission.  shefelt well throughout, and had no shortness of breath other thanorthopnea from her fluid overload.  her oxygen saturation wasconsistenly > 95%.4) hypertension:  she has a history of hypertension, and hadbeen taking toprol xl 25 mg daily.  in the micu she had verydifficult to control hypertension, and was given metoprolol,hydralazine, and amlodipine.  a labetalol drip was started verybriefly, for only a few hours.  on the floors, mrs.[known lastname 59024]blood pressure was moderately well controlled on metoprolol 50mg [hospital1 ], and amlodipine 10 mg daily.  she was given lasix 40 mgpo once prior to discharge, and discharged on 80 mg po daily,per renal, plus toprol xl 100 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mgdaily.5) anemia:  the patient had a persistently low hematocrit duringthe admission, however she also had an elevated ldh andpersistent nucleated rbcs, therefore hematology/oncology wascalled. review of peripheral smear was consistent with stresshematopoesis due to acute liver failure and not autoimmunehemolytic anemia.  they felt that her elevated ldh and bili, aswell as low haptoglobin, were all a result of her liver disease. she likely has an underlying anemia of chronic disease from herrenal failure.  her hematocrit was stable between 30 and 32prior to discharge.medications on admission:toprol xl 25 mg dailyprednisone x 2 daysflonaserobitussindischarge medications:1. calcium carbonate 500 mg tablet, chewable sig: two (2)tablet, chewable po tid (3 times a day).disp:180 tablet, chewable(s) refills:22. amlodipine besylate 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).disp:60 tablet(s) refills:23. toprol xl 100 mg tablet sustained release 24hr sig: three (3)tablet sustained release 24hr po once a day.disp:90 tablet sustained release 24hr(s) refills:24. lasix 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:2discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:acute liver failure, resolvingacute on chronic renal failurehypertensiondischarge condition:good, stable.discharge instructions:we have increased your dose of toprol xl to 300 mg daily.  wehave also started you on a new medication for your bloodpressure called amlodipine, 10 mg daily.  we have also startedfurosemide (lasix) 80 mg daily to help remove fluid.call dr.
