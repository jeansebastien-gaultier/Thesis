patient was re-admitted on [2146-3-10] back to the generalsurgical service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal painand tachycardia.  admission abdominal/pelvic ct revealed minimalinterval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreaticpseudocyst, but decrease in size of remaining loculated fluidcollections. large bilateral pleural effusions with associatedcompression atelectasis were noted, as well as increased amountof abdominal and pelvic free fluid. he was admitted to the sicu,made npo, started on vigorous iv fluid rescusitation, a foleywas placed, and he received iv pain medication with good effect.he had a very long, and complicated hospital course..in the process of repairing his florid necrotizing pancreatitissecondary to his history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, heultimately developed recurrent pseudocyts, which have plaguedhim throughtout his hospital stays since [48]/[2145]. to date, thesepseudocyts have been managed largely with percutaneous catheterdrainage of the pseudocysts. initially, during this admission,this was the approach to managing the patient's recurringpseudocyts. the patient underwent drainage of pancreaticpseudocysts on [2146-3-10] and [2146-3-18], ultrasound and ct-guided,respectively. however, he developed an accumulating posteriorretroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there wasevidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. therecent drainages of the other satellite lesions have dried themup. the main retroperitoneal cyst continued to grow in size, andbecame symptomatic for him. he was unable to eat full meals andhas a diminished capacity to keep food down, as well as a poorappetite. he also repeatedly spiked temperatures..given his history of a left lower extremity acute deep venousthrombosis, vascular surgery was consulted. in lieu of plannedsurgical intervention on [2146-4-5] for treatment of the abovepseudocyst with adhesions, the patient underwent placement of abard g2 inferior vena cava filter, which went withoutcomplication. then on [2146-4-5], the patient underwent externaldrainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis,which also went well without complication (see operative note).after a brief, uneventful stay in the pacu, the patient wasreturned to the floor npo with an ng tube, on iv fluids and tpn,with a foley catheter and two jp drains in place (one in thepseudocyst and one in the abdomen to drain ascites), he wascontinued on a fentanyl patch and was given a morphine pca withgood effect. he was hemodynamically stable..neuro: upon admission, the patient received iv pain medicationprn transitioned to a morphine pca with good effect and adequatepain control. when tolerating oral intake, he was transitionedto oral pain medications. after the surgery on [2146-4-5], thechronic pain service was consulted. his pain was controlled oncethe fentanyl dose was increased to 75mcg/72hr plus the morphinepca. when again tolerating a diet post-operatively, the pca wasdiscontinued, and he was started on oral pain medication inaddition to the fentanyl patch with continued good effect. heremained neurologically intact..cv: upon admission, tachycardia responded to vigorous iv fluidrescusitation and beta-blockade with metoprolol 50mg tid.metoprolol was increased to 75mg tid with eventual excellentrate and bp control. by discharge, the metoprolol was decreasedto 50mg [hospital1 ]. the patient remained stable from a cardiovascularstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored..pulmonary: tachypnea on admission. chest cta revealed largebilateral pleural effusions with associated compressionatelectasis. tachypnea resolved with diuresis with lasix andsupplemental oxygen. he was given albuterol and atroventnebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of theincentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient receivedchest pt with improvement in overall respiratory status. able towean off supplemental oxygen. cxr on [3-17] revealed stillextremely low lung volumes. hazy opacification at the left baseis consistent with pleural fluid. obscuration of thehemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. theright lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence ofpulmonary vascular congestion.starting on [4-12], he spiked a temperature to 103 po and his wbcincreased from 13 to 23,000.  he had a ct abdomen performedwhich demonstrated a left pleural effusionon the upper cuts of the abdomen. thoracic surgery was consultedfor management of the pleural effusion. on [2146-4-14], he underwentultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleuralpigtail catheter. plural fluid for culture, gram stain,cytology, chemistries, and afb was sent. the pleural pigtailcatheter was removed on [4-15]; post-removal cxr revealed minimalapical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence oftension. unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. afollow-up cxr on [2146-4-18] showed continued low lung volumes withleft basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to therecent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. noappreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. the patientremained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter.respiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequentambulation was encouraged..gu/fen: on admission, the patient was made npo and he receivedvigorous iv fluid rescusitation. a foley catheter was placed.allowed clears on [3-11] and [3-12], but an ng tube was placed on[3-13] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resultingwith 1400ml bilious output. after successful clamp trialovernight, the ng tube was discontinued on [3-15] in the morning.given persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a piccwas placed, and tpn was started on [2146-3-14]. with the decisionto proceed to surgery, tpn was continued through [2146-4-12]. whennot npo for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fatregular with good tolerability and intake. when the foleycatheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void withoutproblem. patient's intake and output were closely monitored, andiv fluid was adjusted when necessary. electrolytes wereroutinely followed, and repleted when necessary..gi: admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated.shortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guidedpseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with adrainage catheter left in place to gravity on [2146-3-10]. liverand pancreatic enzymes began trending down. follow-upabdominal/pelvic ct on [3-16] demonstrated enlargement of thepreviously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerousnew large collections in the peritoneum. the drained collectionhad significantly decreased in size. on [3-18], the patientreturned to interventional radiology for drainage of an anteriorcollection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity.the previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocystwas succesfully drained with a catheter left in place togravity. unfortunately, as noted above, he developed anaccumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued toprogress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreaticremnant within it. he underwent external drainage of pancreaticpseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. a (l)flank drain was left in place. after the surgery, his symptomsimproved..id: admission blood cultures were negative. [3-10] fluid culturehad no growth. on [3-17] after receiving ffps, the patient mounteda fever with a tmax 101.5 po. blood cultures were negative.fluid cutlure from the [3-18] drainage also revealed no
