differentiation andis diffusely hypodense. there is minimal sulcal effacement.there is no associated intracranial hemorrhage.  elsewhere inthe brain, there is no edema, hemorrhage, mass effect, orevidence of infarction. ventricles and sulci are otherwisenormal in size and configuration for the patient's age. nofractures are identified. the right maxillary sinus is againatelectatic and completely opacified. remaining paranasalsinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. theconfiguration of the calvarium is again unusual, with thinningof the posterior calvarium bilaterally, with a congenitalappearance.ct perfusion: the perfusion maps demonstrate an extensive regionof prolonged transit time and reduced blood flow and bloodvolume throughout the right mca distribution, compatible withinfarct. there is no mismatch to indicate a penumbra.head and neck cta: there is an abrupt cutoff of the superiordivision of the right m2 segment of the right middle cerebralartery. the inferior division arises early from the m1 segmenton the right. there is a relative paucity of distalopacification within the mca territory on the right. however, afew opacified vessels are present, the result of collateralflow. the remainder of the circle of [location (un) 431] is patent withoutother area of occlusion. the anterior communicating artery has aslightly bulbous appearance. the cervical carotid and vertebralarteries and major branches are patent with no high-gradestenoses. however, the entire right cervical ica is slightlydiminutive in caliber relative to the left, and slightlyirregular suggesting a long segment of atherosclerosis. bothcarotid bulbs demonstrate atheromatous irregularity withouthigh-grade stenosis. there is atherosclerotic calcification ofthe cavernous carotids bilaterally as well.lung apices demonstrate scarring and high-density materialbilaterally, with bronchiectasis at the right lung apex. theaortic arch and origin of the major vessels demonstrate denseatherosclerotic calcification.the right internal carotid artery measures 8.3 mm at the bulb, 3mm just above the bulb, and 3 mm at its upper portion. the leftinternal carotid artery measures 9 mm at the bulb, 5 mm justabove the bulb, and 3.3 mm along the upper segment.impressions:1. large acute infarct in the right mca distribution, with noperfusionmismatch.2. abrupt occlusion of the superior division of the right m2segment of the right middle cerebral artery, with decreasedfilling of distal branches. otherwise, patent circle of [location (un) 431].3. atheromatous irregularity at the carotid bulb bilaterally,with slightly diminutive right cervical ica along its entirelength, suggesting long segment atherosclerosis versusvasculitis. however, no high-grade stenosis of either side.4. slightly bulbous appearance of the anterior communicatingartery. please correlate with angiography.5. complete opacification and atelectasis of the right maxillarysinus as seen previously.[2148-1-11] nchct:findings: again noted is loss of the [doctor last name 352]-white matterdifferentiation in the right insula. sulcal effacement and lossof [doctor last name 352]-white differentiation extends to the right frontal andparietal lobes in a right mca distribution. no evidence of acutehemorrhage is seen. there is some compression of the rightlateral ventricle, not significantly changed from the priorexamination. general prominence of the ventricles and sulci iscompatible with generalized atrophy, age related. areas ofperiventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likelyreflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.no concerning osseous lesion is seen. there are vascularcalcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. completeopacification of the right maxillary

repair [2147-12-20]. returned from rehabto our ed as a code stroke due to left-sided weakness, and wasfound to have a right-m2 (superior division) occlusion,presumably due to cardioembolic clot given her aflutter withouta/c. given iv-tpa in the ed, with some improvement in her lue(anti-gravity strength), but this was c/b a large and painfulhematoma in the region of her recent surgery, which requiredthat she go to or urgently with orthopedics for fasciotomy torelieve pressure from compartment syndrome (70mmhg pressuremeasured by ortho). her h&h dropped, but improved appopriatelyafter transfusion of 2u prbcs. her family decided to stoppursuing aggressive care measures; fasciotomy and transfusionwere performed due to their palliative value (pt. in severe painfrom pressure/compartment syndrome). pt was made cmo by familyand transferred to the floor, with removal of tubes, lines, andinvasive interventions and testing measures. she remainedcomfortable, but minimally responsive, with prn sublingualmorphine and with scopolamine patch. she died [2147-1-16].medications on admission:1. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule [year (4 digits) ]: one (1) capsule po bid
