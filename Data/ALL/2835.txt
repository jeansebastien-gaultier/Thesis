course:assessment and plan: 44 year old woman with schizoaffectivedisorder and sah s/p coiling l mca aneurysm transferred from oshwith with epiglottitis and resp distress now intubated..#. epiglottitis/hypercarbic respiratory failure: patientinitially presented to osh with sore throat and was found tohave imaging (neck x ray and ct per report) consistent withepiglottitis. abg also consistent with hypercarbia andrespiratory acidosis with concomitant metabolic alkalosis. sheleft osh ed and subsequently presented with stridor and wasintubated for airway protection. epiglottitis can be caused bythermal or inhalational injury but is more commonly caused byinfection. the most common bacterial causes include h flu, streppneumo, beta hemolytic strep and staph aureus but viral causesare also possible.  patient was intially treated with decadronand empiric ceftriaxne. she was on insulin ss while on steroids.rapid resp viral panel sent, antigen was negative, viralcultures pending at the time of discharge; blood cx sent andwere no growth. patient was evaluated by ent with laryngoscopywhile intubated and again after extubation. initial impressionwas that epiglottis was mildly inflamed.  after she wasextubated, she had another endoscopic exam and was noted to havesome vocal cord dysfunction, improved with relaxation techniquesand no obvious epiglottitis. patient was transferred to thefloor on [10-3] and continued to do well. still had a sore throat,but no wheezing or shortness of breath, no dysphagia. ent alsorecommended increasing omprazole to 40 mg daily. have scheduledoutpt ent follow-up.# pea cardiac arrest- this occured while in icu, patients pulsereturned after 1 minute or so of chest compressions. etiologywas felt to be possibly secondary to biting the tube versusrelated to propofol. patient had some pleuritic chest painrelated to chest compressions later in hospital course, treatedwith ibuprofen, tylenol and one dose oxycodone. patient hasoxycodone at home still for headaches and continue to take theseas needed for chest pain as well.#. anemia: hct at current baseline 30-32 with high normal mcv..#. h/o sah and mca aneurysm s/p coiling [2130-7-2]

independent.discharge instructions:you were admitted with wheezing and difficulty breathing andrequired intubation. you also had a cardiac arrest which lasteda short period with return of your heart beat with cpr/chestcompressions. the likely cause of the wheezing was vocal corddysfunction, although a viral illness and or gastric reflux mayhave been contributing. there was initially concern aboutepiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottis), but this onlymildly inflamed when they looked with a camera in your throat.you will need to take a higher dose of omeprazole (40mg) andwill need to follow-up with ent and pcp as scheduled. you shouldcontinue your other outpatient medications as you did previouslyfollowup instructions:name: [last name (lf) ], [first name3 (lf) ] v. mdaddress:
