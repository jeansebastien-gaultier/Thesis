[known lastname 52] is a 63-year-old woman withrecurrent burkitt's lymphoma who is d+15 of [hospital1 ] admitted froman osh with hypotension and neutropenia after a syncopal episodeat home..# hypotension/syncope: she was found to be hypotensive to 58/38by ems, which responded to fluids. she was fluid resuscitated tosbp of 70s by ems and sbp of 90's by osh ed prior to transfer.blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vancoand transferred to 7 [hospital ward name 1826]. on arrival she was given 2l offluid, 1 unit of blood, and cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.her pressures responded. osh cultures came back as vre 1:4bottles, sensitive to ampicillin, daptomycin, levofloxacin, andlinezolid. she was switched to ampicillin on [10-12] and her piccwas pulled. she was switched to daptomycin on monday [2134-10-18]because she had begun receiving hyper cvad part b and ampinterferes with clearance of methotrexate.  she had a tte andtee which showed no vegetations. as she was being treated forthe bacteremia, ms. [known lastname 52] again became hypotensive andfebrile, requiring transfer to the [hospital unit name 153] where she requiredpressors. blood cultures were sent and ultimately returnedpositive with pseudomonas, believed to be associated with hercentral line. her line was pulled and her broad spectrumantibiotic coverage (started given her sepsis in the setting ofneutropenia) was narrowed to cefepime, gentamicin, andlinezolid. gentamicin was d/c-ed a few days after transfer tothe floor and linezolid was transitioned to ampicillin as thepatient was believed to have leukosuppression secondary to thelinezolid. she completed a 10 day course of antibiotics (amp andcefepime) from the time her anc was greater than 1000 per idrecommendations and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stablefor the remainder of her hospital course..# burkitt's lymphoma: she was admitted on day +15 of [hospital1 ]. anlp with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [2134-10-14]. asubclavian line was placed on [10-15] and treatment with hypercvad part b was started on [10-16]. she tolerated her chemotherapywell, complicated by mild mucositis and the bacteremia discussedabove. she had one more round of intrathecal chemotherapy withcytarabine on [11-4]. lps on [11-18], and [11-11] were negativefor malignant cells. patient had significant right shoulder andarm pain as well as right hand weakness, believed secondary tobrachial plexus involvement of her lymphoma. she underwent mriof her r shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4sessions of xrt as a palliative therapy. she had 4 lp's whichwere negative for malignant cells. had it cytarabine on [11-18]prior to discharge which she tolerated well. pt had ct of torsoto evaluate for progression of disease, read at the time

given elevated lfts, will trend lfts asoutpatient and do liver ultrasound if necessary. pt was givenpentamidine prior to discharge for pcp [name initial (pre) 1102]..# cardiomyopathy: patient became tachycardic at the time of hersecond episode of sepsis. this continued intermittently throughher [hospital unit name 153] stay and subsequently on the floor. tachycardia wassinus in nature, up into the 140s with movement, and wasattributed to an underlying cardiomyopathy (ef 45-50% on echo,last on [10-29]). cardiology was consulted for management and shewas started on metoprolol 12.5mg [hospital1 ] which she tolerated well..# dvt: found to have right upper extremity dvt last admissionand was on lovenox for that until she had a drop in platelets(treatment related). she was thrombocytopenic during heradmission and her lovenox was held. an ultrasound of the arm wasrepeated and was negative for clot..# hypothyroidism: stable. continued levothyroxine 100mcg podaily.#
