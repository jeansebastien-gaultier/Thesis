orthopnea .no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .the patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .by the time the patient arrived at the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room he was in moderate respiratory distress .his initial blood gases on 40% 02 was p02 102 , pc02 115 , ph 7.11 .the patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered do not resuscitate .the patient was not intubated .however he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .a chest x-ray in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital emergency room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .there were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .these were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .past medical history :associated medical problems include :1. atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .2. anxiety .3. coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .4. history of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .medications on admission :1. ativan 1 mg po twice a day .2. trusopt 1 gtt left eye three times a day .3. xalatan 0.005% one gtt left eye qhs .4. brimonidine 1 gtt

isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of 1/29 there were no significant changes .hospital course :the patient was stabilized in the medical intensive care unit .he stayed in the unit for about one day .during that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with albuterol .he was also started on intravenous ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .he was diuresed with intravenous lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2l urine output on the first day and 1.5l the second day .after one day in the medical intensive care unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .this consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous solu-medrol .as the patient 's diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .a chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .the patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .the antibiotic chosen was levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .this was started on 4/2/99 and should be continued for ten days .the ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .the patient 's respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .it was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .the patient 's major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with lasix .while in the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient on 4/4/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in cimetidine while in the intensive care unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .the patient was upgraded to prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .the patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .the patient 's abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to prilosec .while in oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .it is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .they wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .condition on discharge :the patient 's respiratory status was stable .i think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .he needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for physical therapy to increase his muscle strength .medications on discharge :1. albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .3. ativan .5 mg twice a day
