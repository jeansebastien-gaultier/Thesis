[known lastname 88321] is a 48 year old gentleman with a pmh significantfor hcv cirrhosis and a recent admission for a traumatic fallwith multiple iph requiring bolt placement, multiple orthopedicfractures s/p surgeries, trach/peg with hospital coursecomplicated by serratia pneumonia treated with pip/tazo nowadmitted for hypoxemia.# hypoxemia/leukocytosis: ctap demonstrates a new right-sidedpleural effusion with rll collapse and volume loss throughoutright side. compressive atelectasis was considered, althoughcould not rule out hcap. with regard to new pleural effusion,lfts were largely unchanged from prior, making hepatichydrothorax unlikely. this may be a parapneumonic effusion withunderlying pneumonia, or could also be from new heart failure.would also consider chylothorax given history of trauma. thepatient underwent thoracentesis on the first hospital day and1.2 liters of exudative fluid were removed from the rightpleural space. cultures from the fluid came back negative, andthe antibiotics were stopped. trauma surgery was consulted whofelt that the pleural fluid might be secondary to trauma. theyrecommended for repeat imaging in [2-4] days to see if the fluidwas reaccumulating. also, they recommended for repeat imaging ifthe patient develops any new respiratory symptoms.interestingly, the fluid from the thoracentesis had aneosinophilic predominance (56% eosinophils). at the same time,the patient was noted to have a peripheral blood eosinophilia.this was all felt to be secondary to depakote, which had beenrecently started. the divalproex was therefore stopped.notably, after the thoracentesis, the patient's respiratorystatus improved markedly and he was able to be weaned back tothe trach mask. with regard to work-up for other causes ofpleural effusion, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not showany cardiac dysfunction, and infectious studies, as above, allreturned negative. cytologic analysis showed no malignant cells.antibiotics were stopped after the first hospital day.due to the calficifications noted on ct scan, a tuberculin skintest was placed to the right forearm on [12-22]. this should beinterpreted on [12-24] or [12-25]. the spot of the ppd placement ismarked with a bandaid.# mental status: his mental status remained at baseline, perfamily members and rehab facility notes. he was agitated andminimally interactive. he required prn doses of haldol andativan for agitation. with regard to the history of traumaticbrain injury, neurosurgery was consulted during this admissionand did not feel there was any need for intervention. head ctwas deferred. he was continued on keppra for seizureprophylaxis. divalproex, as above, was stopped due to peripheralblood and pleural fluid eosinophilia.# anemia: hematocrit was 35.8 on admission, baseline during lastadmission 27-33 with macrocytosis. his hematocrit remainedstable.# orthopedics: orthopedics was contact[name (ni) ] during this admission.follow-up plans are outlined in the discharge orders.# hcv cirrhosis: lfts were at baseline.# depression: continue home psychotropic regimen.# ulcerative colitis: not currently treated.# nutrition: pnt recieved tf's fen: tf..# ppx: recieved heparin sq..# access: double lumen picc in lac;
