ventricular systolic function is lownormal (lvef 50-55%). the right ventricular cavity is mildlydilated with normal free wall contractility. the aortic valveleaflets are mildly thickened (?#). trace aortic regurgitationis seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. mild tomoderate ([12-29]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. there is a smallto moderate sized pericardial effusion. the effusion appearscircumferential. no right atrial diastolic collapse is seen. noechocardiographic evidence of tamponade physiology. comparedwith the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of[2171-11-6], the pericardial effusion is new. left ventricularfunction appears less vigorous. the severity of mitralregurgitation is increased..[2172-9-22] chest (portable ap): portable semi-upright chestradiograph demonstrates an interval increase in right basilaropacity, which likely represents a component of pleuraleffusion. superimposed atelectasis and/or consolidation is notexcluded. the heart size is moderately enlarged. the mediastinalcontours are notable only for calcification of the aortic arch.the pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits..[2172-9-22] ct abd & pelvis w/o contrast:lung bases: granulomata are seen within the lungs bilaterally.there is alarge right and small left pleural effusion with a density ofsimple fluid.  compressive atelectasis is seen at the rightgreater than left lower lobes.  there is a moderate-sizedpericardial effusion, with the attenuation of slightly complexfluid ([doctor last name ] 15-30). there is coronary arterial calcification, andthe heart is moderately enlarged.abdomen: evaluation of the abdominal viscera is limited by lackofintravenous contrast. the liver is grossly unremarkable, withoutintrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. the spleen is normalappearing with note made of marked splenic arterialcalcification. the adrenals are normal bilaterally.  thepancreas demonstrates coarse calcification as noted previously,consistent with diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, with atrophyof the distal body and tail. within the body of the pancreas,there is a 1.8 cm ovoid soft tissue focus which is more densethan the surrounding gland and is stable compared with multiplepriors. a calcification is seen within the wall of thegallbladder which was not seen on the prior which is likely anon-dependent or adherent stone. the gallbladder is otherwiseunremarkable. the kidneys are atrophic and there is perinephricstranding. there is no hydronephrosis and there are no stones,though note is made of diffuse vascular calcification.paraesophageal lymphadenopathy is noted, increased in sizecompared withprior, and likely reactive. the stomach is collapsed and notwell evaluated.  loops of small bowel are normal in caliber andenhancement. there is fecalization of distal loops of ileum.there is a moderate amount of abdominal ascites. there is nointraperitoneal free air. the aorta iscalcified along its course, though normal in caliber. there is asmallfluid-filled periumbilical hernia. there is no retroperitonealhematoma.there is a fluid-filled left inguinal hernia. there is diffusebody wallstranding compatible with anasarca.pelvis: the bladder is normal appearing. the prostate andseminal vesiclesare unremarkable. the rectum is normal. the [doctor last name 499] is normal. theappendixis normal. there is haziness of the central mesentery andretroperitoneum,which is likely resulting from similar process from thepatient's ascites.bone windows: there is multilevel degenerative change of thethoracolumbarspine, but no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions..[2172-9-23] echo (tte): the left atrium is mildly dilated. leftventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. thereis mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (lvef = 45-50 %).right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.the diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levelsare normal. the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).there is no aortic valve stenosis. trace aortic regurgitation isseen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there ismild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. there is a small tomoderate sized pericardial effusion. the effusion appearscircumferential. there are no echocardiographic signs oftamponade.impression: moderate pericardial effusion with no echo signs oftamponade. mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mildglobal left ventricular hypokinesis. mild pulmonaryhypertrension.compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [2171-11-6],the pericardial effusion is new. left ventricular function isnow mildly depressed. estimated pulmonary artery pressures aresimilar..[2172-9-23] abdomen u.s. (complete study):  study is technicallylimited. the liver is grossly normal without focal lesion orintra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. moderatevolume ascites is noted. the gallbladder is minimally distendedwithout wall thickening or edema. there may be a small tinyadherent stone. the common bile duct is not dilated measuring 3mm. pancreas and aorta are not well seen due to overlying bowelgas. the imaged ivc is unremarkable. the spleen is top normal insize measuring 12.1 cm. there is no hydronephrosis, stone ormass bilaterally with the right kidney measuring 10.7 cm and theleft kidneymeasuring 10.8 cm.pericardial fluid:negative for malignant cells.mri head. multiple punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the leftcerebellarhemisphere which represent small acute infarcts in the leftposterior inferior cerebellar artery territory. these are likelyof embolic or hypoxic etiology. mra was not performed but majorflow voids are grossly patent.tte [10-12] there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophywith normal cavity size and global systolic function (lvef>55%).due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motionabnormality cannot be fully excluded. right ventricular chambersize and free wall motion are normal. the aortic valve leafletsare mildly thickened (?#). there is a very small circumferentialpericardial effusion without ra or rv diastolic collapse. thereare very prominent left pleural and right pleural effusions aswell as ascites.brief hospital course:79m with cad, diastolic chf (ef 50-55%), afib on coumadinadmitted with volume overload in setting of n/v at home x 3days, found to have inr 19 with no bleeding complications andmoderate pericardial effusion with no tamponade physiologytransferred to ccu for hypotension in setting of diuresis. hewas stabilized and went to the floor. on the floor, the patientwas unwilling to participate in most aspects of care. he tookoff his telemetry leads, then was found unresponsive by a nurseand was found to be in pea arrest, likely secondary to cardiactamonade. there was a prolonged amount of time without a pulse.he was taken back to the ccu, where he underwent intubation andcooling protocol. off of sedation, there was evidence ofextensive neurologic damage, and a poor functional recovery wasexpected. because of underlying kidney failure and uremia, hereceived hemodialysis to achieve a bun less than upon admission(when he was mentating well). because of poor renal clearance,serum benzos remained positive. he was given flumazenil toreverse any effect they may be having, and there was a minimalresponse. ethics was involved and after extensive discussionwith all available contacts, it was decided to make the patientcmo. the patient expired several hours later on [2172-10-13].medications on admission:home medications:warfarin 3 mg dailylipitor 40 mg/daycilostazol 50 mg [hospital1 ]vitamin b12doxazosin 4 mg qhs,lasix 40 mg/dayimdur 90 mg/dayinsulinlisinopril 5 mg dailytoprol xl 100 mg/dayntg prnaspirin 81 mg/dayprotonix 40 mg/dayiron.medications on transfer- metolazone 2.5 mg [hospital1 ]- lasix 15 mg/h iv gtt- tylenol 325-650 mg q6h prn pain- asa 81 mg daily- pantoprazole 40 mg q24h- insulin sliding scale- atorvastatin 20 mg dailydischarge medications:not applicabledischarge disposition:expireddischarge diagnosis:expireddischarge condition:expireddischarge instructions:not applicablefollowup instructions:not applicable
