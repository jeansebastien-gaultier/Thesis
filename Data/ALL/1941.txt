headache: given history the concern was for intracranial [doctor last name ]initially. head ct was without bleeding, and head mri/mra/mrvwas without bleeding or vascular malformation or venousthrombosis. patient initially refused lp. since his headachepersisted for four days without resolution and reported left eyeblurriness, and left eye pain. neurology was consulted and theythought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenonand less likely intracranial [doctor last name ]. they recommended an lp torule out [doctor last name ] or infection given his vague symptoms. fioricetwas started to treat his headache. on day 5 of hishospitalziation, his headache resolved, however 24 hours laterhis headache returned during [doctor last name 2286]. given the non-specificheadache, an lp was performed after patient ultimatelyconsented. first attempt at bedside was unsuccessful. heeventually underwent an lp under fluoroscopic guidance atinterventional radiology with csf only notable for a mildyelevated opening pressure of 27 cm h2o. he notably had only 1wbc, 0 rbcs, and negative culture, cryptoccocal ag, ebv and hsvviral pcrs. the headache persistently had an unclear etiology. the leadingdifferential was vasospasm vs. migraine vs. htn vs. ?hd related(since it was more prominent on hd days). it was decided todiscontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil ismore vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine,and htn etiology.  his headaches persisted despite theseinterventions. pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may behelpful. it was felt that an injection would not be helpful,given the diffuse nature of his headaches. fioricet wasdiscontinued, as it did not appear to be effective any more. hewas continued on full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn. his htnmedication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought thisthis would help his headaches. this moderately controlled hisheadaches. he also had severe nausea and vomiting that wascontrolled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was alsothought to help his headaches. he was given a trial of high flowoxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache, butthis was not successful. of note, the patient was felt to be quite sensitive to opiatesand benzos. on the day of his ir guided lp, he received 1 mg ofiv ativan, which decreased his rr to 8 and he appeared verysleepy. he also received 4 mg iv morphine to help control hisha, but he also developed decreased rr to 8 and the samesleepiness. he was not given these medications any more. since the etiology of his headache was unclear, it was feltthat placing the patient on a regimen that he could take at homewould be the best for him, rather than iv dilaudid. pain wasre-consulted. he was started on low dose ms-contin [hospital1 ] and 25 mgtopomax [hospital1 ]. approximately 36 hours after these medications werestarted the patient was completely somnolent and responsive tosternal rub only. he was given narcan 0.4 mg approximately threetimes over the course of his somnolence and woke up briefly. heremained in this state for nearly 72 hours. it was felt thepatient was on too much sedating medication causing thisdeleterious effect. all opiates, topomax, and gabapentin wereall d/c'd. he was given an extra day of hd in hopes that thiswould clear some of the medication that has built up in hissystem. he remained hemodynamically stable and protected hisairway. these medications should be re-started only ifabsolutely necessary and with extreme caution. he was not givenany more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol,1000 mg q 8h. surprisingly, tylenol by itself appeared tocontrol his headaches in the days leading up to discharge. hewas headache free in the last 24 hours of his admission.it is truly unclear what the cause of his headaches are. it isstill speculated that hd may be the cause, as small studies havedemonstrated hd may cause headaches. it is unclear what thetreatment for this is. also, htn headaches did not show a clearpattern, it is striking how when his blood pressure is ideallycontrolled, his headaches have cleared. nevertheless, hisheadaches have resolved for the time being and further follow-upwith his pcp is in order.# hypertension: his hypertension was most pronounced onhemodialysis days with sbps in the 200s frequently.  as aresult, his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased. he began to take all of his anti-hypertensives everyday of theweek, including on hd days. he continued to have very high bloodpressures after this regimen. his bp medications were increasedto maximal doses. a clonidine patch was added at 0.1 mg qweekly. he continued to have episodes of sbp to the 200soccuring after [hospital1 2286] in the setting of a severe headache. hewas transferred to the micu for closer monitoring. his micucourse was uneventful as his blood pressure decreased with ivhydralazine x 1 and po labetalol, along with taking his bpmedications. he did not need an iv drip for blood pressure. hewas then started on minoxidil 10 mg po bid. near the end of hishospitalization, his blood pressure was lower than expected withlevels in the low 100s. minoxidil was decreased to 5 mg [hospital1 ]. itwas also noted that he was not wearing his clonidine patch forseveral days in the setting of well controlled blood pressures.after consultation with renal on the day of discharge, hiscurrent regimen is as follows:--lisinopril 80 mg po daily (to be held the mornings prior tohd)--valsartan 320 mg qhs--carvedilol 25 mg po bid--minoxidil 5 mg po bid (to be held the mornings prior to hd)---close follow up with his bp is highly recommended.# nausea/vomiting: this was initially thought to be due togastroparesis, but a ges was performed which showed normalmotility. his n/v were felt to be secondary to his severeheadaches. his metoclopramide was continued, as was compazineand zofran.   at times, despite these medications, he continuedto have nausea and vomiting. this proved quite difficult tomanage his blood pressure, as he would vomit his medication.once this was controlled, his blood pressure and headaches, andeventually his nausea and vomiting improved. he was dischargedon metoclopramide 5 mg po tid. further evaluation of thisstanding medication should be evaluated by his pcp at his nextvisit.# cranial nerve iii palsy: diplopia was initially reported on[2-11].  on further questioning the patient reports his symptomsbegan on [2-7] after the ophtho exam.  neuro initially evaluatedand feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes.  lp negativebesides increased icp of 27 mm hg. optho re-consulted [2-18] andconfirmed complete cn3 palsy as the cause of diplopia andcomplete ptosis of left eye. it was felt that this may bereversible, but if not, it can be surgically corrected. he willfollow up with neuro-optho in the outpatient.# dm1: continued home 75/25 plus hiss. he was given half hisstanding dose when not tolerating po.# ckd: continued hd. pt continued on sevelamer alone (phoslodiscontinued).# neuropathy: gabapentin was increased to tid initially, butwhen patient became somnolent for several days, this medicationwas discontinued. of note, he was on a very high dose for hdpatients (300 mg tid). it was felt this may have contributed tohis somnolence. caution should be made in the future if thismedication were to be re-started. he was continued on alidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.# depression: during an episode of severe pain, the patientstated he wanted to "kill himself." since he has a history ofsuicidal attempts, a 1:1 sitter was attempted. through thecourse of the day, growing concern that he would act on hisideations by the sitter. psychiatry was consulted and felt hewas not suicidal at this time, and the sitter was discontinued.he was continued on citalopram. social work actively consultedthe patient and helped him deal with his many social problems.[name (ni) ] is to be followed with psychiatry in rehab.# low grade fever: a fever of 100.5 was noted during hishospitalization. he was pan-cultured which was ngtd at time ofdischarge. a chest x-ray did not show any acute finding. he wasnot given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.# access: he had a right central line during thishospitalization which was pulled prior to discharge. he has aleft av fisula used for hd.# code: fullmedications on admission:medications (per

strong sedating medications, such as dilaudid,gabapentin, and ambien. you were continued on tylenol alone forpain control, and surprisingly, this alleviated your headaches.you are advised to not take these sedating medications any moreas it is very difficult for your body and kidneys to processthese medications. on the day of discharge, you were headachefree.your blood pressure was also very high
