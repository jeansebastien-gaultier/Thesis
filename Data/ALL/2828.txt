chemotherapy , the patient noted worsening of her rectal pain along with fever and chills .ct done as an outpatient showed inflammation and hemorrhoids but no obvious abscess .the patient continues with rectal pain and fevers and eventually went to an outside hospital lichampm kane ancester medical center where ct scan revealed a tiny area on the right consistent with hemorrhoids versus a tiny
