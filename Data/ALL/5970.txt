abscesses/vertebralosteo/meningitis/bacteremia/skin lesions/uti): pt found to havemssa from blood and also grew mssa from urine.  vancomycin wasstarted, then switched to nafcillin when the organism wasidentified. tte was performed and showed no vegetations. it isunknown what the portal of entry for the mssa was. thebacteremia, skin lesions and uti resolved with appropriateantibiotic therapy. ortho spine was consulted and recommendedserial imaging to determine whether epidural abscesses wereincreasing in size or causing spinal cord compression. pt gotmris approximately once a week and on the 3rd it was more clearthat the patient would require surgery. she underwentneurosurgery [10-30] and for epidural abscess drainage (and c7corpectomy, c4-t1 fusion, t3-4 laminectomy).  multiple abscessespresent (~5, with 3 major ones), hardware place, cultures sent,debrided.  upon repeat imaging post operatively, mri showedexpanding t-spine epidural abscess, so she then underwent lspine decompression [11-2] with debridement.  per id, gentamycinwas added to help with nafcillin penetration for a 5-day course,which was completed on [11-6]. pt will continue on nafcillin forat least 8 weeks and will follow up with spine and id.  hertentative stop date for nafcillin is [2187-12-29], or it may bestopped on [12-14] when she visits id.  she has an appointment withspinal surgery on [2186-12-27].  she will need to have her staplesremoved on [2187-11-23] in rehab with log role [last name (lf) 10313], [first name3 (lf) ] spinesurgery. she is to have weekly [first name3 (lf) ] draws faxed to the infectiousdisease physician, [last name (namepattern4) ]. [first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (namepattern1) ]..#hospital acquired pneumonia: treated for hap with vancomycinand cefepime from [11-11] through [11-18].  her nafcillin wasstopped during this treatment and was restarted on [11-19]..#. altered mental status: the patient was initially minimallyresponsive. this was thought to be secondary to meningitis aswell as the severity of her infection. this resolvedsubstantially with antibiotics. she did remain minimallydelerious throughout her stay (generally oriented x3 withmoments of confusion). mri head was normal..# weakness: as pt's mental status improved and she becamecooperative with  neuro exam, it became clear that she haddiffuse weakness with some focality (especially r arm) withsensation relatively intact. neurology was consulted who feltthat some of the weakness could be [12-25] cord inflammation and sopt recieved pulsed steroids early in her admission withoutsignificant effect. pt underwent emg which showed a mixedpicture (see emg report for full details). pt did undergodecompression on [10-30] and [11-2] but strength remained similar..#. gi bleed:  on [2187-10-28] pt developed melanotic stools and ahematocrit drop from 24 to 20. iv ppi was continued and sherecieved 1u of prbcs and had an egd which showed severeulcerations in stomach and duodenum most consistent with nsaiduse (pt did use ibuprofen at home). per pt she had had a normalcolonoscopy at [hospital1 112] 4 yrs ago and this was not repeated as aninpt. pt also reports h/o duodenal ulcers in the [2147]. an hpylori was sent and was positive. treatment of h pylori wasdeferred in setting of nafcillin therapy and severe infection.pt was continued on ppi, eventually  transitioned to po. pt willneed 2 week course of amoxicillin and clarithromycin after hernafcillin treatment is complete (nafcillin does not cover hpylori.)she should continue lansoprazole until her visit with thegastroenterologist in [month (only) 404]..#. persistent sinus tachycardia: pt maintained hr of ~100throughout her admission (~1 month). this was felt to mostlikely be related to her severe underlying infection andrecurrent low grade fevers. intravascular volume depletion wasalso a likely contributor given pt's low albumin and anasarcaand clinical appearance of being dry (dry mouth, low jvp). pewas considered, however, pt was on dvt ppx throughout admissionand ekg did not have any changes. further, pt's oxygenrequirement was minimal to none and ultimately it was decidedthat pe was highly unlikely. also given her prolonged stay maybe a pe, though this is less likely..#. edema: patient was noted to have anasarca and an albumin of1.9. pt was not diuresed aggressively as she appearedintravascularly depleted and had minimal oxygen requirement. heredema improved upon discharge..#. anemia: pt remained anemic throughout her stay. perhaps shehas had ulcers for some time contributing to her anemia. herreticulocyte count was 6.7 arguing against marrow suppression asthe etiology, however, iron studies were consistent with anemiaof chronic disease. the transfusion goal was set at 22. sherecieved 2u of prbcs throughout her stay..#. pain: patient had severe back pain throughout her admissionthat was ultimately treated with a fentanyl patch with smallboluses of iv morphine for breakthrough pain. a kanair bed wasalso found to help with her pain..#. rash: on admission pt had 2 rashes. she had diffuse smallpustules which grew mssa and resolved c antibiotics. she alsohad, on the left back, a 4 x 3cm erythematous plaque with acentral brown / black, rough, necrotic area which was biopsiedby dermatology and showed "focal necrotizing vasculitis inmid-dermis with focal thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis ofepidermis and appendages" which dermatology felt was consistentwith a reactive process, rather than representing a primaryvasculitis, given the clinical scenerio..#. acute renal failure: pt had [last name (un) ] on admission, which resolvedc ivf..#. elevated transaminases: pt had elevated lfts on admission,most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration orbilliary sludging in the setting of sirs.  ruq ultrasoundunremarkable. this was trended and resolved..#. thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemiawas concerning for consumptive process like ttp or dic onadmission, however no chistocytes on smear.  most likely due topoor production in the setting of infection and resolved duringadmission..#. nutrition: she failed speech and swallow on [11-12].  apercutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube was placed on [11-15] and tubefeeds continued..# electrolyte abnormalities: patient had persistent hypokalemiaand hypophosphatemia. standing electrolyte orders were instilledand should be continued in rehab until levels normalize. also, achem-10 should be checked every other day while taking thesemedications.#. access: patient has a picc placed in the right arm
