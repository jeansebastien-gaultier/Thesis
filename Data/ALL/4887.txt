:cnis 10-29 :1. 60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery .2. 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery .echo 11-02 : pre-bypass : left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( lvef>55% ).resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mild apical hypokinesis .the aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .there are complex (> 4 mm ) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta .mild tricuspid regurgitation .post-bypass : preserved kindred / north shore - ventricular systolic fxn .trivial mr .edith ai .aorta intact .ct 11-04 : no acute intracranial hemorrhage .findings consistent with small vessel ischemic changes .mri would be more sensitive for the detection of acute infarction .ct angiogram demonstrates no stenosis or aneurysm in the intracranial circulation .slight irregularity of the origin of the right vertebral artery may be atherosclerotic in nature .normal contrast enhancement seen in the left common/internal carotid artery stent .mild stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery .4 mm left upper lobe lung nodule .in the absence of history of malignancy , this is statistically benign .one-year followup may be considered .cxr 11-06 : allowing for technical changes , no major adverse interval change has occurred .bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis together with bilateral pleural effusions appear relatively unchanged .the mediastinum appears unchanged .left-sided subclavian line is unchanged in position .there is evidence of prior cardiac surgery .2015-11-13 06:15 am blood wbc - 8.8 rbc - 2.79  hgb - 8.6  hct - 25.4

hospital course :ms. bridge was admitted from osh for coronary artery bypass surgery .she underwent usual pre-operative testing along with carotid ultrasound .cnis revealed carotid stenosis and she ultimately underwent left carotid stenting by vascular surgery on 10-30 .please see report for details .on 11-02 she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2 .please see operative report for surgical details .she tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the csru for invasive monitoring in stable condition .later on op day sedation was weaned , she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated .on post-op day one chest tubes were removed and beta blockers and diuretics were initiated .she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight .also on this day she was transferred to the sdu .early on post-op day two ms. bridge had an episode of aphasia .she underwent an immediate head ct and neuro consult and was transferred back to the csru .ct was negative and she returned to baseline neuro status without deficits by arrival to csru .neurology concluded episode was most concerning for tia .epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day four .after remaining stable in the csru for several days without change in neuro status she was transferred back to the sdu on post-op day four .she was then started on heparin with transition to coumadin ( goal inr of 2-3 secondary to h/o bilateral dvt 's).during entire post-op course she was followed by physical therapy for strength and mobility .she continued to improve steadily over the next several days without any other post-op complications .she was discharged on post-op day 11 .medications on admission :meds at home : coumadin , levoxyl , folate , colace ,
