hospital course:61 year old female with copd on 3l home o2 s/p recent admission[12-2] for copd exacerbation and newly diganosed lul mass nowadmitted with respiratory distress..#. acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/cough: on admission,the patient was complaining of 3 days of cough and sob thatacutely worsened overnight. she presented to an osh and wastransferred to the [hospital1 18] ed for further managment.  she wasplaced on bipap in the ed and transferred to the micu. she hadhypercapneia with a pco2 of 57 initially, and was placed on nonrebreather mask with little improvement, and was then started onnon invasive positive pressure ventilation. patient howevertolerated this poorly and required intubation for severerespiratory distress.during acute decompensation, it was noted that patient wastaking very high frequency shallow breaths with a constant coughlike sound generated in the upper airway. patient was relativelyeasy to ventilate and this raised question of paradoxycal vocalcord dysfunction, phrenic nerve injury, etc. during intubationhowever, vocal cords were noted to be normal in appearance andduring serial imaging diaphragms remained symmetrical.patient was treated with pulse dose steroids and started onazithromicyn. given known left upper lobe nodule, a ct scan ofthe chest was performed and did not show any significantinterval change. patient was sucessfully extubated on [1-28] withshort nivppv bridge. patient was transfered to medical floor on[1-28].  she had an uneventful course and was discharged in stablecondition.pt has been having financial problems and has not been able toafford tiotropium (spiriva).  social work was consulted and shewas given ipratropium instead.patient was slowly weaned off steroids with taper over the
