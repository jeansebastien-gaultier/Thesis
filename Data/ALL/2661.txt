6/23/2004attending: raymundo rodriuez mdthe patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronicobstructive pulmonary disease with the last fev1 of 0.42 ,congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately40% , who was transferred from bradpark hospital for continuedtreatment for worsening shortness of breath. the patient reportsthat one week prior to her admission to the daspe i health ,two days before transfer to the ordma medical center , thepatient felt more dyspneic on exertion. she noted that she ishaving a hard time even getting to the bathroom. ordinarily , athome , her baseline using 1.5 liters of oxygen at rest , but ableto get around the house and upstairs. she went to lahorn mulg medical center on sunday. she reports that she had a dry cough withoutany sputum production. no fever or chills. no sick contacts.no hemoptysis. no runny nose or sore throat. this is differentfrom her usual copd excerebration , in which it is no longerproceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection.in addition , the history reveals that the patient usually usestwo pillows to sleep , but recently had been using two pillowsfolded and felt short of breath if she lay down more than that.she would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short ofbreath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previousmonths.review of systems: the patient has gained 15 pounds in one yearprior to admission. she believes that it was due to previoussteroid use. she also notes that she had some diarrhea that was"like pudding" 1-3 times per day. not watery , not bloody , andnot black. no recent antibiotic use.allergies: the patient has an allergy to aminophyllin. she hashypotension and arrhythmias from that. she has a reaction tobeta-blockers in which she has worsening breathing.past medical history:1. copd in august , 2004. the patient had a fev1 of 0.42 andfvc of 1.95.2. congestive heart failure , april 2003. an echocardiogramshowed a left

and sating 95% on 2 liters ofnasal cannula. general: the patient was talking 2-3 words at atime. she cannot speak in full sentences. she is usingaccessory muscles for breathing. her jugular venous pressure waselevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. thepatient's hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure.the patient had no pallor and no jaundice. her extraocularmotions were intact. her pupils were equal and reactive tolight. the patient's oropharynx revealed thrush on the tongue.chest exam: there were decreased breath sounds. they were softand expiratory wheezes at the bases. no crackles and no rhonchi.cardiovascularly , the rhythm was regular , tachycardiac , with a1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. the abdomen was soft , ,nontender , and nondistended. there were bowel sounds.extremities: there was no edema , nontender. symmetricextremities. no clubbing.social history: the patient lives with her husband of 43 years.they have no children. the patient has not used tobacco since1984. she has occasional alcohol use. she notes that she drinksone drink every month approximately.at the outside hospital the patient's labs were as follows. herwhite count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12bands forms. hematocrit was 45. her platelet count was 290 , 000.her ptt was 42. her inr was 2.2. her chem-7 and her sodium was139. her potassium was 4.5. her chloride 101 and bicarbonatewas 31 and bun was 20. her creatine was 1.1. her glucose was118. her total protein was 7.7 with an albumin of 4.2 , ast of29 , alt of 43 , and alkaline phosphatase of 104. total bilirubinis 0.3. her ph was 7.38 with the carbon dioxide of 54 and anoxygen of 37 on 20% fio2 , which is ambient air. this was notedto be an arterial blood gas. her ekg showed sinus tachycardia at120 beats per minutes. qrs width was approximately 120milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis.no left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. she had 1-2 mmst-depression in 2 , 3 and avf with t-wave inversions in thoseleads , also t-wave inversions with 1 mm st depression in v5 andv6. the only change from the january , 2004 , ekg is that oft-wave inversion in v5 , otherwise stable.impression: at the time of admission , the patient was thought tobe a 60-year-old woman with severe copd and chf , who presentedwith worsening shortness of breath consistent with a copdexcerebration. however , this was unlike many of her previousexacerbations in that she did not experience any upperrespiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venouspressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might behaving a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well.1. pulmonary: the patient was treated for copd exacerbation ,with prednisone 60 mg by mouth each morning , atrovent andalbuterol nebulizers q.4h. and albuterol and atrovent nebulizersas needed. she was also continued on levofloxacin. initially ,the patient received 500 mg of levofloxacin a day. as her renalfunction worsened that was changed to 150 mg a day and when herrenal function improved again her levofloxacin was once againincreased to 500 mg a day. this should be continued for a 10-daycourse. there is little concern for pulmonary embolism , giventhe patient's elevated inr. however , she did have a decreased o2saturation and her co2 was not very elevated at the outsidehospital. a d-dimer was sent which was less than 200 , which isnegative , suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism. thepatient's pulmonary status improved throughout her stay , and bymay , 2004 , she was sating in the 90% range on 2 liters nasalcannula , almost at baseline. it was thought by the physicaltherapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonaryrehabilitation. as this dictation is being done , the plan is forher either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at thehospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is notat an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis.2. cardiovascular:a. pump: initially , the patient was thought to possibly bevolume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking herlasix and that her jvp appeared elevated. in addition , there wassome question whether she might has been having increasingparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. she wasinitially diuresed aggressively with 60 mg of iv lasix , twotimes. however , lab results suggested that congestive heartfailure was not a large part of her presentation. first , thebrain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value ofproximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 ,suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of herheart failure. in addition , the patient's creatinine increasedfrom her outside hospital value of 1.0. when it was firstchecked at 1:00 in the morning on january , 2004 , at clinchau hospital , it was 1.7. she received her two doses oflasix , one on the night of november , 2004 , and then again in themorning of january , 2004. her creatinine in the afternoon of march , 2004 , increased to 2.2. urine electrolytes were sent and theacute renal failure workup will be discussed below under therenal section. in terms of her heart failure , the patient wasgiven iv fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heartfailure. her normal dose of 40 mg of lasix p.o. every morningwas restarted on september , 2004 , and she will be continued on thatdose.b. rhythm: the patient was monitored on telemetry and after hersinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemiaimproved and she had no further issues.c. ischemia: the patient was continued on aspirin hmg-coareductase inhibitor. she was continued on her folic acid , aswell. she was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospasticresponse to that , but she was continued on her angiotensinreceptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved.3. renal: the patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.0from the outside hospital and 1.71 when she first presented. herbaseline is in the low 1's; 1.0-1.5 as her baseline. the peakcreatinine during her stay was january , 2004 , at 5:00 p.m. and itwas 2.2. her bun at that time was 55. urine electrolytes weresent , which showed a urine sodium of 39 , and creatinine of 137 ,and that was only 12 hours after the patient got her last dose oflasix. it was felt that the patient had prerenal azotemia andwas given iv fluids. her creatinine improved , and on may ,2004 , the patient's creatinine was 1.3 , approximately herbaseline. her bun at that time was 30 , increased from 23 on april , 2004. the patient will be monitored as an outpatient to makesure that her lasix dose is not too high.4. musculoskeletal: the patient's creatine kinase was elevatedon admission to 574. it was rechecked on april , 2004 , and itwas 1967. it was felt that this was due to two factors.increased release from the muscle , as the patient's mb-fractionwas only 33.5 , which was less than 5% and the troponin wasnegative. so this was felt to be due to her increased work ofbreathing and release from the muscle and exacerbated by heracute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase. hercreatine kinase decreased by july , 2004 , to 1195. therefore ,it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renalfailure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatinekinase disease from increased work of breathing.5. hematology: the patient was continued on her coumadin. thepatient's inr throughout her stay remained therapeutic between2.4 and 2.6. on may , 2004 , it was 2.5. she was continued onher home dose. the patient's white blood cell count was elevatedat admission at the outside hospital with a left shift. she wasstarted on levofloxacin and steroids. therefore , it is difficultto interpret her white count deferential. her white countremained elevated between 15 and 20 throughout her stay. herneutrophil count remained between 70 and 78% of that. aurinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had aurinary tract infection.6. the patient's tsh was 0.46 with a normal t4 of 7.8. she willbe followed up as an outpatient , as this may representsubclinical hyperthyroidism. in addition to her thyroid , thepatient's osteoporosis was continued to be treated with calciumcarbonate , vitamin d , and fosamax during her stay.7. rheumatology: the patient was continued on her probenecid250 mg two times a day. she has no symptoms of gout.8. psychiatry: the patient was continued on her clonazepam andcelexa. she was not continued on ritalin and will not bedischarged on her ritalin given her tachycardia. in addition ,the patient did not feel that the ritalin was helping her.9. pain. the patient's vioxx was discontinued because of herrenal issues. this will also not be one of her dischargemedications and it should be reassessed by her primary caredoctor. the benefits may outweigh the risks , but this should beup to dr. satterfield , who has a long-term relationship with thepatient.10. infectious disease: the patient had blood cultures sent ,which were negative. at admission , in addition , her urinalysisshowed many red blood cells. it did have some white blood cellsand leucocyte esterase. this is most likely just because thepatient had bleeding , secondary to her foley catheter.discharge medications: please use the patient's discharge sheetfor discharge medications.escription document: 1-0714061 emssten teldictated by: barus ,
