l. foot ulceration with surrounding erythema, painhpi: 50f w/longstanding type i dm with retinopathy, nephropathy, autonomic and peripheral neuropathy, recent development of l. heel and forefoot ulcers, here with a few days of pain, erythema, and swelling around her l. forefoot ulcer. she has an extremely complicated history of r and now l. foot infections and ulcerations, in setting of here severe neuropathy and dm. she originally sustained a r. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, with poor union, and subsequent fracture of her 2nd &#8211; 4th metatarsals. she developed a chronic ulcerated callus over her r. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis&#8212;this did not improve despite multiple courses of antibiotics. she underwent i+d of her r. foot ulceration in 12/89, or cultures grew p. aeruginosa. in 3/90, she underwent debridement of her chronic r. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting. in 6/90, she underwent deep debridement of her ongoing 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, along with excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;bone cultures grew mssa. she did well until 2/92, when she underwent r. ankle revision for an equinovarus deformity of her r. hindfoot (calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and achilles lengthening). she subsequently developed a r. heel ulceration, and in 4/92, underwent debridement of this ulceration, removal of a screw, and placement of a vacuum sponge. her wound continued to heal poorly, and she underwent r. sfa to posterior tibial bypass grafting. in 7/92, she underwent debridement of her r. heel wound and placement of a full thickness skin graft, which has taken well; she feels that her r. heel has been healing nicely. during her long hospitalization in 4/92, she started developing l. heel and l. forefoot ulcerations. she attributes the heel ulcerations to chronic pressure from her position in bed, and the forefoot ulcerations to the boots that were used to relieve her heel pressure, which apparently abraded her forefoot chronically. these ulcerations continued to worsen over the next few months, and she presented with cellulitis of this area in 8/92. she received vancomycin, levofloxacin, flagyl initially, then augmentin, with persistent poor healing of her wounds. on 9/10, she underwent operative debridement of her l. plantar heel ulcer&#8212;she was found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her l. heel eschar, which was extensively debrided; she received a course of linezolid postoperatively. she had an angiogram on 9/12, which showed no significant flow limiting lesions in her lle, and good flow through her prior r. sfa to posterior tibial bypas graft. she feels that her wounds have been healing fairly well recently; she feels that her r. heel is almost completely healed, and that her l. heel ulcer is smaller than it was previously. her l. forefoot ulcer is also more shallow than it was in the past. over the past 2-3 days, she developed fairly acute swelling, erythema, and pain around her forefoot ulcer, with erythema spreading to the dorsal surface of her foot. she was seen in vascular surgery clinic, and was admitted for antibiotics and further debridement. she has a chronic &#8216;fast heartbeat,&#8217; denies any systemic symptoms (no fevers, chills, sweats, notable weight changes), headaches, sinus symptoms, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in her bowel movements, dysuria, frequency, le edema, rashes, myalgias, or new arthralgias. she feels that her foot erythema has improved significantly overnight with vancomycin.pmh:poorly controlled type i dm since age 12&#8212;complicated by diabetic retinopathy s/p bilateral vitrectomies for retinal hemorrhage, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic nephropathy (gastroparesis)&#8212;on an insulin pumpchronic foot ulcerations, initially r, now l, requiring numerous antibiotic courses and operative interventions:2083: r. 5th metatarsal fracture in 2083, poor union, subsequent fracture of the remainder of her r. metarsalschronic ulcerated callus over r. lateral metatarsal heads, with underlying osteomyelitis, no improvement despite multiple courses of antibiotics12/89: i+d of r. foot ulceration&#8212;cultures grew p. aeruginosa3/90: debridement of chronic r. lateral plantar ulceration and skin grafting6/90: deep debridement of her 5th metatarsal osteomyelitis, excision of her 5th metatarsal&#8212;cultures grew mssa2/92: calcaneal osteotomy, lateral translation, dorsiflexion first metatarsal osteotomy, and achilles lengthening for equinovarus deformity of her r. hindfoot4/92: subsequent development of r. heel ulceration, s/p debridement of her ulceration, removal of a screw, vacuum sponge placement4/92: r. sfa to posterior tibial bypass grafting7/92: debridement of her r. heel wound and full thickness skin graft (12 x 5cm)9/92: development of l. heel and forefoot ulcerations at rehabilitation, with debridement of her l. plantar heel ulcer on 9/10&#8212;found to have extensive necrotic yellow-brown tissue underlying her escharpicc-associated rue dvt 7/92, on coumadins/p l. ankle fracture in 2083r. foot rsd s/p multiple r. lumbar sympathetic blockss/p r. carpal tunnel surgeryhypothyroidismiron deficiency anemiadepression&#8212;inpatient admission 2090 with suicidal ideationss/p subtotal thyroidectomy 2073s/p breast lumpectomy 2078&#8212;has missed her follow-up mammogram appointments due to her foot issues2088 colonoscopy with &#8216;precancerous polyp&#8217;&#8212;needs repeat evaluationhome medications:insulin pumpacetaminophen650 mg po q6h prn pain,headachecalcium carbonate 1250 mg (500 mg elem ca)   1 tab po tidclonazepam0.5 mg po bidclonazepam0.25 mg po qd prn insomnia,anxietyclotrimazole 1% cream   topical tp bid prn itchingdesipramine hcl175 mg po hsdocusate sodium (colace)100 mg po bidfolic acid1 mg po qdhaloperidol    1 mg po qhshydromorphone hcl (dilaudid)4 mg po q4h prnlevothyroxine sodium250 mcg po qdomeprazole40 mg po qdsennosides liquid2 tsp po qhstherapeutic multivitamins (multivitamin therapeutic)1 tab po qdtrazodone200 mg po qhswarfarin sodium5 mg po qpminpatient medications:antibiotics:-vancomycin 1g iv bid (10/25-)immunosuppressants: noneothers: home medications, sc heparin, novolog sliding scale q6hrsallergies:&#183;

        continue vancomycin 1g iv bid for now. her renal function is impaired from her dm&#8212;would check a vancomycin trough prior to her next dose.&#183;         please send biopsy of bone underlying her l. forefoot ulcer for gram stain, aerobic culture, and anaerobic culture from or today.&#183;

because of her recent foot issues. unable to stand for mammography because of her foot issues&#8212;will discuss optimal imaging of her l. breast with breast radiology, will hopefully be able to obtain this study during this hospitalization.discussed with dr. craig faulkner, id attending. recommendations discussed with dr. zane querry of primary team. thank you for this interesting consult&#8212;we will continue to follow with you.____________________________________amanda qualls, m.d.
