displacement of the distal fracture segment.  the     sacrum is not well seen secondary to overlying bowel gas.  minimal     degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted.          shoulder: there is no evidence of left shoulder dislocation or     acute fracture.  the visualized lung fields and ribs are intact.     there is minimal degenerative change involving the left a.c.     joint.          chest: comparison to 10/31/97.  multiple pulmonary nodules are     noted.  there is no evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary     edema.  no large pleural effusion or appreciable pneumothorax is     identified.  the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.     degenerative changes of the thoracic spine are noted.          impression:     right transcervical femoral fracture.  no evidence of dislocation.          no evidence of shoulder dislocation.          multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic disease.          findings:     previously noted minimally displaced right hip fracture.     osteoarthrosis of the knee. soft tissues swelling along the medial     aspect of the knee is noted.  there are vascular calcifications.     generalized osteopenia.

require post-operative anti-coagulation. patient is undergoing high-risk procedure and is also at increased risk for vte given cancer dx. according to guidelines from accp:#ufh 5000 units sc tid [or lmwh &gt;3400 units sc qd (her crcl &lt;30, therefore renally dosed = lmwh 30mg sc qd)] to be started either in pacu or on the floor.#compression stockings#pneumo-boots#plan to continue vte prophylaxis for 4-6 weeks post-op#encourage ambulation as soon as tolerated (per ortho, pt might be ambulatory as soon as tomorrow)(2)     dmpatient recently started on insulin at home. will continue half dose of home insulin with ivf with glucose.#riss, until tolerating pos, then restart normal insulin.(3)     dispoplan to d/c when clinically stable post-op. per pcp, patient would like to return directly home after surgery without rehab (home rehab). family notes that patient currently lives at daughter&#8217;s home where there are many steps which would make home rehab difficult.#consider
