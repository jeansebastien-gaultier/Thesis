patient with bilateral pleuraleffusion, consolidations, and known pneumothorax.comparison: ct abdomen from [2167-4-11] and multiple chestradiographsobtained in the interval between [4-9] and [2167-4-13].technique: unenhanced mdct of the chest was obtained fromthoracic inlet to upper abdomen with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mmcollimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronaland sagittal reformats.findings:extensive widespread consolidations involve mostly the rightupper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe but also areseen in left lower lobe and left apex. the consolidations arerelatively high in density (the left upper lobe consolidation isabout 57 hounsfield units in density), as are the right middlelobe and lower lobe consolidations (ranging up to 50 hounsfieldunits). the comparison of the lung bases with a recent ctabdomen from [2167-4-3] demonstrates interval progressionof the consolidations in the right middle and right lower lobe.the bilateral pleural effusion, although did not increasesignificantly in size, is still of high density (up to 46hounsfield units) in the lower portions of the lungs suggestingsedimentation effect.the mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged ranging up to 16 mm inright lower paratracheal area and might be reactive. extensivecoronary calcifications are noted. the heart size is mildlyenlarged. there is no significant pericardial effusion.minimal left pneumothorax is demonstrated, 2a:31, seen in theanteriormediastinum giving the patient's supine position and mightcorrespond to an apical pneumothorax demonstrated on the uprightchest radiograph obtained the same day earlier at 09:09 a.m.although the comparison between the chest ct and chestradiograph is difficult, the size of the pneumothorax is mostlikely unchanged and is small.the imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates fat densityleft adrenal lesion, -19 hounsfield units, consistent withlipoma. the rest isunremarkable within the limitations of this non-enhanced study.again note is made of the presence of contrast enhancement ofthe kidneys consistent with known failure and retained excretionof contrast. contrast is alsodemonstrated in the renal pelvis. the vicarious excretion of thedistendedgallbladder is again noted. the bladder is at least 5 cm indiameter,although no wall thickening or surrounding abnormalities areseen.there are no [year (4 digits) 500] lesions worrisome for malignancy. degenerativechanges are seen.impression:1. extensive bilateral consolidations, right more than left, ofhigh density that might be consistent with multifocalhemorrhage. the differential diagnosis in the presence of renalfailure might include vasculitis. hemorrhagic pneumonia might beconsidered in appropriate clinical setup.2. small left apical pneumothorax, most likely unchangedcompared to priorchest radiograph.3. bilateral grossly unchanged pleural effusions, high indensity that might also contain an element of hemorrhage.4. extensive coronary calcifications.5. still present contrast enhancement of kidneys and vicariousexcretion of contrast the gallbladder consistent with knownrenal failure.brief hospital course:85-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease s/pbms x 2 in rca on [2167-4-10], with post-cath course complicated bypulmonary edema, contrast-induced nephropathy requiring ccu staywith transition to cardiac service.1) unstable angina/cad: patient's typical anginal pain wasoccurring at rest and had st depressions in v4-6. given concernfor ongoing bleeding cath was deferred until [4-10]. cardiaccatheterization demonstrated 90% occlusion of ostial rca whichwas stented with two overlapping bare metal stents. her chestpain occurred intermittently since the pci with intermittent stdepressions in v4-v6. nitro gtt was temporarily started for thepain, and she remained pain free after it was discontinued.cardiac markers were mildly elevated, likely demand ischemiafrom anemia, and ck-mb was negative. she was treated withaspirin, statin, and plavix. patient's metoprolol was restartedonce she stabilized.2) acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: felt to besecondary to rbc transfusions at osh. she had an ongoing o2requirement and desatted to 85% ra on am of [4-11], for which shewas transferred to the ccu and lasix gtt was started. fluid wasinitially removed via cvvh (as below), although once uopimproved, she was successfully diuresed with iv furosemide.3) acute on chronic ckd: fena 6%, likely contrast nephropathy.her [last name (un) ] was held. renal was consulted for poor uop while onlasix drip and high dose diuril. her creatinine rose and she wasstarted on cvvh via l ij line. after a few days, her uop pickedup and responded well to 40mg iv furosemide boluses, so the cvvhline was removed.4) anemia: given concern for rp bleed related to cath, she hadct abd, which showed bilat ?hemothoraces, but no rp bleed. othersource could be gi bleed from external hemorrhoids. she received1 unit of prbcs and her hematocrit remained stable.5) pneumonia: patient had frequent coughing associated withdesaturations. ct chest was concerning for atypical pneumoniavs. alveolar hemorrhage, although pulm consult favored theformer. anca and anti-gbm were negative. she received a 5 daycourse of azithromycin and a brief course of prednisone forpossible diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (one day each at 60mg,40mg, 20mg, 10mg). her cough greatly improved.6) diabetes mellitus: initially on glargine, although changed toinsulin gtt in the ccu due to highly elevated (300s) sugars inthe setting of steroids. she was transitioned back to glargineas the steroids were rapidly tapered.medications on admission:home meds:amlodopine 5mg dailyatorvastatin 20 mg
