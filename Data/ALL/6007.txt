was dominated byrespiratory failure and inability to wean from ventilator. itwas felt he had an aspiration event, and that aspirationpneumonitis was the primary cause of the respiratory failure.initially, he required muscular paralysis to maintain ventilatormechanics, this was weaned off within 48 hours. he continued tobe hypoxic when attempting to wean him from cmv to cpap, and cxrshowed possible infiltrate, so he was bronched and started onempiric antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia. hecontinued to spike fevers daily until hd 4. when his bal resultscame back as streptococcus pneumoniae, his antibiotics werebriefly narrowed to ceftriaxone monotherapy, then re-broadenedto vanc/cipro/flagyl per the recommendation of an infectiousdisease consult. to further assist in weaning him from theventilator, a lasix drip was begun hd 3 and run for 2 days withgood diuresis. by hd 4, he was transitioned to cpap andbreathing well on his own mechanics. also this day, he displayedgroin and back erythema, thought to be a combination of fungalinfection and drug reaction. on hd 5 he was weaned from propofoland versed to precedex while simultaneously weaning his peeprequirements. he was eventually extubated hd 6 and transferredto the floor.  also of note durinig his icu course: he wasevaluated on ciwa scales but did not score significantly. he haddiarrhea while in the icu, c.dif was negative, resolved withfiber. he was maintained on prophylaxis while in the icu:heparin sub-cu, famotidine, vap bundle.  he had a leftsubclavian central line placed on [2190-5-21].floor course:on [2190-5-26] he was transferred to the floor. his fever curve wasmonitored and trended downward.  his cvl was removed on [5-26] andcultured with no growth. by [5-27] he remained afebrile. however,he was noted to have a rising wbc count to 12 and then 16.9(from 5.5). his chest xray on [5-28] showed no evidence ofpneumonia and he was without cough or sputum. he was weaned offthe oxygen with good oxygen saturation on room air. allantibiotics were discontinued at this point. blood test showedelevated lipase to >800. ruq us showed hepatic steatosis.gastroenterology was consulted and felt this was likely due toalcoholic pancreatitis. patient will follow-up in their clinicfor this.otherwise he remained hemodynamically stable.physical therapy and occupational
