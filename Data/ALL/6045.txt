[known lastname ] is a 76 yr old woman with h/o htn, dm, chf ondigoxin, afib on coumadin, who presented to [hospital3 ] foraltered mental status. pt was last seen acting normally at4:30pm, at which time she reported feeling dizzy and went to laydown. around 7pm, she was found by her husband laying on herright side, moaning and unresponsive. no tremors or bladder orbowel incontinence noted. she was brought by ems into the osh edfor evaluation. there she was reportedly nonverbal but combativeand received ativan 2mg iv x 2. ct head was negative forintracranial hemorrhage. cxr was significant for a rlq pneumoniaand pt was given levofloxacin 750mg iv. a digoxin level waschecked which was elevated to 2.8; k was 5.7. she was given 2vials of digibind and intubated under succinylcholine withpropofol for sedation prior to transport for airway protectiondue to diminished gag reflex in the setting of altered mentalstatus. abg 7.4/41/111 on ac 500/12/70%/5.in our ed, vs: t 97.3, hr 41, bp 154/49, o2sat 99% on ac at tv500, rate 14, peep 5, and fio2 100%. her cxr showed a sizeablerml infiltrate, and vanco dose given with 500cc ns. ekg showedhr in low 40s. 3 vials of digibind drawn up. toxicology wasconsulted and recommended holding further digibind at this timeunless pt drops blood pressure as may overcompensate and affecther baseline therapeutic level of digoxin. she was transferredto micu for monitoring.on the micu floor, pt report is intubated and sedated. per herhusband, she had no fevers, chills, cough, or shortness ofbreath suggestive of pneumonia; no choking or coughing with pointake; no recent sick contacts or hospitalizations. pt eatssmall meals throughout day; husband did not note any recentchange in po intake. she did not complain of any vision

renal failure from dehydration, possiblysecondary to pneumonia. no recent medication changes other thandiscontinuation of propanolol and clonidine, which do not affectthe metabolization of digoxin. patient was monitored ontelemetry with frequent ekgs and labs for hyperkalemia. her ekgsremained stable. she remained hemodynamically stable withgradually improving hrs. toxicology was consulted andrecommended holding off on digibind unless hd unstable or ekgsworsened. this did not occur and no further digibind was given.digoxin was 1.0 on [7-24] and mental status resolved to baseline.will defer to outpatient provider regarding restarting digoxin.once bradycardia resolved patient was restarted on metoprololwithout any unstable hemodynamics.#hypoxemia. the patients oxygen requirements increased to usinga non-rebreather mask on [7-23]. it is likely that this was due tochf exacerbation (supported by bnp > [numeric identifier 389] and findings on ct)as furosemide was being held vs effusions present on ct likelysecondary to the pneumonia. pe was initially considered andruled out by ct angiogram. the patient was gradually diuresedand her respiratory status improved, though this
