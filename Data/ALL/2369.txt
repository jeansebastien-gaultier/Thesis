montesinos , dana m.d.history of present illness: this is a 90+-year-old man withmultiple medical problems , who was recently admitted for a deltams and found to have multiple posterior circulation infarcts ,likely embolic in nature. he was discharged yesterday and nowpresents with fevers , chills , shaking , and increasing abdominaldistention. on admission also , noted to have increased sputumproduction and therefore question aspiration event was consideredwhile at rehab. at his recent hospital stay , he was evaluatedfor pfo , which was found to be negative , had no paroxysmal atrialfibrillation , had hypertensive episodes to systolic bloodpressure of 240 , which responded well to hydralazine. had atroponin leak to peak of 1.94 , which trended down and wasconsidered to be demand related. at baseline , the patient liveswith his wife at home , walks with a walker , and requiresassistance with adls. on arrival on the floor , the patient had atemperature of 101.3 , axillary , heart rate 80s to 90s , bloodpressure 180s/80s , and o2 saturation of 97% on three liters. hisabdomen was found to be quite distended , however not rigid andhad no peritoneal signs.past medical history:1. right hip fracture status post right hemiarthroplasty.2. non insulin-dependent diabetes.3. depression.4. psoriasis.5. leiomyoma.6. hypertension.7. svt.8. history of gi bleed.9. chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.3to 1.6.10. embolic stroke in march of 2006.important studies:1. chest pa and lateral dated 8/14/06 , increased opacificationseen on the lateral view over the lung base concerning forpneumonia , which is probably in the left lower lobe , atelectasiswas seen in the right lung , tiny bilateral pleural effusions arepossible , and heart size is normal.2. abdominal ultrasound on 0/23/06 : 1 ) contracted gallbladderwith gallstones. no sonographic evidence for acutecholecystitis. 2 ) bilateral pleural effusions.3. kub dated 10/30/06 , no subdiaphragmatic air is seen , nohigh-grade obstruction , and limited study due to motion artifact.4. urine culture on 10/30/06 , greater than 100 , 000 pansensitivee. coli.hospital course:1. the patient was found to have a pansensitive e. coli uti and aquestionable left lower lobe pneumonia , which would have likelybeen due to aspiration given the patient's recent stroke anddocumented aspiration by speech and swallow on previousadmission. the patient's white count , which was initially 19.8on the day of admission trended down over the first three days ofhis admission as he was treated with levaquin. the levaquin ,which will cover both the urinary tract infection and thepossibility of aspiration pneumonia will be continued for a totalof a 14-day course to end on 9/27/06. the patient's bloodcultures showed no growth.2. gu , the patient was found to have 1.5 ml of urine in hisbladder when he was admitted indicating significant urinaryretention. a foley was placed and the patient drained the urine.the patient was started on flomax to improve his recovery fromthe urethral obstruction. most likely , the patient hasunderlying urinary retention that was exacerbated by his recentfoley placement during his previous admission. then when he wentto rehab without the foley ( note he did void several times priorto discharge from the hospital ). the patient developed urinaryobstruction likely contributing to his urinary tract infectionand requiring readmission. the foley was kept in place untilhospital day four. when the foley was taken out , the patient didnot void at all. a bladder scan ten hours after the foley wastaken out revealed 432 ml of urine in his bladder. a foley wasreplaced in his bladder and urology was consulted. urologyrecommended bladder rest for seven days meaning that the foleyshould be left in place for seven days and then he is to followup with dr. booker randgaard with the foley still in place for avoiding trial within a week after discharge.3. renal , the patient's creatinine at admission was 2.2 , whichis significantly above his baseline. this was attributed toacute renal failure secondary to the urinary obstruction. whenthe foley was placed , his creatinine steadily declined , and onthe day prior to discharge was 1.2 , which is within his normalrange.4. cardiovascular , the patient continued to be hypertensive withsbps greater than 200 , particularly at night. therefore , duringhis hospital course , his blood pressure regimen was titrated upsuch that at the time of discharge , his blood pressure regimen islopressor 50 q.i.d. and norvasc 10 daily. blood pressures during24 hours prior to discharge ranged from 110 to 140/70s and hisheart rate ranged 64 to 82.5. endocrine , the patient was treated with insulin and his p.o.regimen while inhouse and this can be continued at rehab. hewill be discharged on lantus 12 , novolog sliding scale , andtolbutamide 500 daily.6. gi , the patient had a steadily rising alk phos through thecourse of his hospital stay. at admission , it was 206 and itrose to 508. a ggt was drawn and found to also be elevated at119 , therefore a right upper quadrant ultrasound was completed ,which showed a contracted gallbladder with gallstones but noacute cholecystitis. the patient was found to be constipated onthe day prior to discharge and was given a dulcolax suppository ,which had worked in the past.7. prophylaxis , the patient received lovenox subcu daily.code status: the patient is dni though he would want to beresuscitated with cpr , defibrillated ,
