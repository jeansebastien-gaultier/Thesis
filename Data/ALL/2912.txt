i had the chance today to see terri bird in follow-up, as her primary care physician. as you are well aware, she is 71-year-old female who resides currently at the elm hills nursing home where you have been taking care of her. i have not seen her now for the past ten months. for my records, i am going to summarize her medical history briefly. it includes a history of atrial fibrillation. she is status post an mvr with duluth clinic. she is on chronic anti-coagulation. she is status post a renal allograft for what is believed to be a history of strep glomerular nephritis. she has been on imuran and prednisone for several decades with no history of rejection. she also has a history of a cabg in the setting of her valve replacement. as well, she has a history of spinal stenosis, for which she has been treated intermittently with epidural steroid injection. about a year ago, she had an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and in this setting developed some delirium and at that point was sent to rehab where she had a ankle fracture and a long recovery and she spent time at several different nursing homes and had a hip fracture as well as a recurrent ankle fracture and most recently has been with you at elm hills nursing home. i also have a discharge summary from a recent hospitalization where she had a pneumonia, a right middle lobe which was successfully treated with levofloxacin.  medications: her current medications from the notes that i received include premarin .3mg, neurontin 300mg each day, miacalcin nasal spray, provera 2.5mg, synthroid 25mcg, digoxin 125mcg, cardizem cd 180mg a day, imuran 100mg a day, lopressor 50mg twice a day, calcium carbonate 500mg three times a day, isordil 3 times a day as well as coumadin based on her inr. allergies: she has an allergy to penicillin as well as sulfur and cephalosporins and of note she had been on a tapering prednisone dose which seems to have been stopped. as well, she is on sliding scale insulin and humulin n, which seems to have been adjusted recently. re:  bird, terri                                                    mrn: 80910690                                                           january 13, 2067page 2  the patient was brought to me today by her family, because they were concerned that she was not getting optimal care. in talking to her, she says she feels quite well. she has no pain. she has no pain in her buttocks or her legs. she says her breathing feels well. she has no productive cough. she has no chest pain. she denies any peripheral edema. she notes that she is concerned that she is not getting enough exercise at elm hill nursing home, but otherwise feels like she is getting reasonable care. however, she does breakdown and cry about her current situation in that she is depressed about living in a nursing home.  physical examination: on the exam today, her blood pressure is 122/70. she has a regular rate and rhythm on heart exam with a pulse of 72. she has sharp clicks over her chest. she has a soft abdomen with no organomegaly and a well healed scar. she has equal pulses bilaterally. she has got a normal skin exam with multiple skin tags. she has a full range of motion in her upper extremities as well as her hips, knees and ankles. she has a stooped gate and i watch her walk with her walker and she seems relatively stable. she is somewhat confused about the date and the place, but recognizes me and is able to articulate very clearly about her current situation at elm hills.  i have no laboratory data to speak of.  i had a long conversation with her and her husband as well as her son and daughter-in-law and explained my concerns with her overall safety and i thought that currently it would be unwise for her to be in an unsupervised setting. i thought that a nursing home is a reasonable place for her to be and suggested quite strongly to consider an antidepressant. it looks like you have had a psychiatrist evaluate her recently and i think it would be worthwhile, at least a month trial of ssri, gradually titrating up the dose based on her side effects.  i am more than happy to see her intermittently to give her reassurance, but it seems like your care has been excellent and feel free to contact me with questions about her past history.  sincerely,    steve george, m.d.
