[due toacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may besignificantly underestimated.] the tricuspid valve leaflets aremildly thickened. there is no pericardial effusion.impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct ofunknown acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent withmultivessel obstructive coronary [last name (un) ] diseaseeeg [2108-3-5]:this telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.throughout the recording, the background was one of burstsuppressionalternating between frequent sharp generalized triphasic wavesat amaximum frequency of 2 hz to a more suppressed pattern ofsuppression ofthe background for periods of up to eight seconds alternatingwithbursts of low amplitude activity. in the recent past thosetriphasicappearing waves probably represent short electrographicseizures.brief hospital course:in brief this is a [age over 90 ] yo man with dm2, pad who presented withasystolic cardiac arrest.# asystolic arrest: most likely respiratory arrest. initiallystarted on cooling protocol but this was stopped for elevatedinr. since admission he remained nonresponsive with fixed anddilated pupils. he was intubated and remained so for theduration of the hospitalization. daily spontaneous breathingtrials were negative. trach was placed and his care wastransitioned to a ventilatory rehab facitlity.# hypotension: he was noted to be hypotensive in the ed and wasgiven ivf and started on pressor support with norepinephrine. hewas waned of this medication and was able to mantain his bp. anecho was obtained showing ef20% hypokinetic lv and pcwpelevated. this is suggestive of systolic sysfunction and suggesta cardiac etiology of hypotension. he was gradually weaned offpressors and maintained a normal bp (90-120 systolic) forseveral days. his tamsulosin was held.# coagulopathy: likely [1-2] combination of warfarin and recentantibiotic use. no evidence of dic. this was reversed withvitamin k and ffp. he was then placed on hep gtt when his inrwas subtherapeutic. after the trach and peg he was restarted oncoumadin. he will be bridged back onto coumadin at theventilatory rehab center in [1-3] days. goal inr 2.5-3.5.# h/o [date range 1291]: on heparin ggt for thrombus ppx. transition towarfarin with heparin bridge for 2 days at inr>2.5.# neurological disturbances: as noted he was unrespionsive toverbal and painfull comands. initially his pupils were fixed anddilated. he was placed on eeg and a head ct showed small vesselischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy. no evidence ofhemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascularterritorial infarction. his eeg identified foci of seizureactivity, which occurred with concurrent uncontrolled musclemovement suggesting a seizure. neurology followed the paitent.he was started on keppra and this was uptitrated to effect (i.eabsence of seizure activity on exam and eeg). during his stay heexbited some change in neuro exam, in that he was minimallyresponsive to pain and pupils more reactive. however this wasvery short lasted (one day) and subsequently he was againnonresponsive.# acute renal failure: initially he was noted to have anelevated creatinine of 2.1 from 1.o in recent months. also thiswas associated with oligouria. this improved with pressuresupport and diuresis, suggestive that the renal failure wasrelated to decreased forward cardiac output.# longitudinal care: palliative care consult obtained andseveral meettings were held with family members and spiritualleader. decision to mantain ventilatory support unless evidenceof worsening multiple organ failure.# foot ulceration: noted severe ulcers on right foot, consistentwith prior documented note by vascular surgery (tendonsexposed). continued wound care.# nutritional support: provided through tube feeds during hishospitalization. peg tube placed for future support.# complicated uti: on cefpodoxime (h/o proteus and enterococcusin urine sensitive to ctx -
