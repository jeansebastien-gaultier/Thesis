and evidence of metastases and recent spread to spinewho presented with worsnening dyspnea on exertion and weightloss.the patient's chief reason for presenting to the icu wasmultifactorial hypoxia due to his copd, chf, pleural effusionand probable aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  on presentationhe was started on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia.nevertheless he continued to have worsening of his dyspnea andsputum production and during the day of [2156-1-11] he was noted tobe increasingly hypoxic and his oxygen saturations were droppingto the 80's on 6l nc.  he was switched to 100% nrb andmaintained sats in the 90's on that but appeared to be tiringand was transferred to the icu on [2156-1-11].  at that point a bloodgas revealed profound respiratory acidosis and he was thenintubated for ventilatory failure.  the patient has treated withvancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for aspiration/hap and wasgently diuresed.  no microbiologic diagnosis of the patient'spneumonia was ever made and despite bal no organisms were everisolated.  on [2156-1-13] a thoracentesis was performed to evaluatefor complicated effusion and this showed sterile inflammatoryfluid consistent with parapneumonic effusion.  the patient didimprove somewhat allowing some weaning of ventilatory settingsand acutally self extubated on [2156-1-14].  unfortunately, afterextubation mental status remained poor and the patient becameprogressively more hypercarbic requiring reintubation on [2156-1-15]. on the morning of [2156-1-16] nif was checked and was less than 30suggesting generalized muscle weakness and high likelihood ofventilatory failure if extubated.  with this information, andgiven the patient had been reluctant to undergo chemotherapy inthe first place and had expressed a desire to not be permanentlysustained on artificial means, his husband and family decided toterminally extubate the patient and make him comfortable.  hewas extubated on the evening of [2156-1-16] and gradually became morehypoxic before expiring of respiratory failure.  his husbanddeclined autopsy.medications on admission:# maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine 15-30 ml po 15 minutes beforemeals as needed for
