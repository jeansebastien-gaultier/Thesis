( interval unspecified ) , prozac 40 mg. po q.day , lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .physical examination :remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .his pulse exam was intact .cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .there was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .a patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with lasix , morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .post-procedure he was admitted to the ccu because of the history of left main dissection .he remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .the next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by psychiatry and treated with ativan .the patient was then evaluated by cardiac surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .in the course of preoperative workup , mr. has was evaluated completely by psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .on december 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 st. jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .the total bypass time :2 hours 25 minutes .total crossclamp time :1 hour and 48 minutes .the patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on lidocaine at one , dobutamine at 200 and nipride .the patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .in addition , he remained agitated .this was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with haldol appropriately .on day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the lasix/ mannitol infusion .his urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .he required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with nipride which was changed to hydralazine to avoid shunting .he received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .with positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and lidocaine .his chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .infectious disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with vancomycin , ceftazidime and gentamicin .cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an r and t phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged qt interval .consequently his pronestyl was discontinued .in addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .on the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .on 60% fio2 his po2 was 63 .it was increased to 65% with po2 of 81 .at approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .the patient was immediately given 400 mg. of calcium chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and cpr was initiated and code was called .the patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with emv and he was bolused with levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .the patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .the chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .the patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of epinephine , one-half mg. of atropine and a bolus of lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.the family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .lenni breutzoln , m.d.tr :bp / bmotdd :12/17/93td :12/18/93cc :g hemp , m.d. taarnna has , m.d.
