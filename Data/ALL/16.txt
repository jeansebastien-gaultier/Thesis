echofrom 2004 , dm ii complicated by neuropathy , hyperlipidemia , and age.she presented with overt symptoms and clinical signs of congestive heartfailure , including complaints of progressive shortness of breath , pnd ,fatigue , and peripheral edema. her physical exam was significant for anelevated jvp , lower extremity edema , pulmonary rales , laterally displacedpmi , and s3 gallop , all consistent with heart failure. even though thepatient had cardiolmegaly on cxr from 2004 , her lvef was about 60% ,suggesting a recent development of chf. her ekg showed nsr with new lbbb ,and no qw. due to her multiple atherosclerotic risk factors , new lbbb ,and evidence of neuropathy , the initial impression was that she had arecent ischemic event. three sets of cardiac enzymes were negativeduring her first 24 hours stay. she had a stress mibi showing noscars or evidence of reversible ischemia with a calculated ef of 23%. anecho showed dilated lv , with globaly reduced le function and near normalpulmonary pressures , suggestive of dilated cardiomaypathy. extensiveinterviewing of the patinet was negative for other possible etiologies ofhf , tsh and a1c were normal , and and the cause of her dilated cmpremained undifined. she was diuresed to a dry weight of 57kg , respondedwell to po lasix ( 40-60mg ) , treated also with toprol xl 25mg , andspironolactone 12.5mg. her symptos completely resolved both at rest andwith gentle ambulation. one can argue toward evaluating her coronarayarteries either by cath or cta to exclude balanced ischemia. howeverconsidering her age , no changed in ekgs , negative mibi , and an echo withglobaly reduced ef , we choose to medicaly treat her. she will beevaluated in the future for aicd/crt , then a cath can also be considered.she will follow up with dr. rafael abeita .additional comments: 1. please go to your primary care within a week to check your potassiumlevles.2. please avoid salty food ( and don't add to food ).3. weight
