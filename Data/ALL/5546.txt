record date: 2097-06-03 time of visit: 6/03/2097, 1330 hourstime of note: 1630 hourspatient seen and examined with the team.  note of dr. ellis reviewed, findings confirmed.  available electronic notes reviewed, x-rays reviewed, labs reviewed.  73 y. o. woman who has worked as a nurse at tlc for 40 years.  nonsmoker.  history of hypertension treated with hyzaar.  current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell.  she finds it difficult to get started on her work because of fatigue.  she has had a cough that initially produced yellowish, "slimy" sputum, but more recently has been dry.  she notes occasional wheezing.  she also noted muscle and joint pain involving the shoulders and lower extremities over the past 5-6 months that she attributed to "arthritis".  no polyuria, but has noted nocturia x2 for the past 5-6 months. during the same period of time, has noted very dry mouth. no abdominal pain, but some difficulty with constipation for the past two weeks.appetite diminished and she lost about 30 pounds.  she noted a nodule on the extensor surface of the left elbow that her pcp "cut into" recently.  she has also noted a nodule on the dorsal surface of the right foot that seems to "get larger".  she experienced substernal chest pain with radiation to the back that lasted several hours, prompting her to come to the er.  no associated diaphoresis, nausea.  pain somewhat better with sitting up.  of note, she has known of having a cardiac murmur for many years.  exam:  pleasant black woman in no distress.  bp 158/79, pulse 80, regular; o2 sat 98% on room air.  afebrile.  skin darkly pigmented nodule left elbow extensor surface, similar nodule right dorsal foot just proximal to 4th/5th toe.  no other rashes.  heent:  pale conjunctivae, anicteric.  no nasal findings, no facial skin findings (specifically, no lupus pernio).  dry mucous membranes.  neck: small, soft, mobile 0.5 cm node left anterior cervical chain.  chest:  inspiratory crackles at both bases.  cardiac: no jvd.  regular rhythm.  iii/vi (i do not feel a thrill) harsh nearly holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium, but especially prominent at the rusb with radiation to the clavicles, neck.  also heard at the apex and radiates to the left mid-back (?same murmur).  the murmur intensifies when she stands.  no gallops.  no rub.  abdomen soft and nontender.  no spleen tip.  liver edge not palpable.  lymph nodes:  fullness below the left axilla, although not confident of discrete nodes.  data:  there is considerable testing available to us from her recent visits to the walk-in clinic and to dr. utter.  a cxr from 5/2097 shows bilateral hilar adenopathy, mediastinal adenopathy, and interstitial infiltrates.  creatinine 1.7date/time         ca             alb            06/03/2097        12.3 (h)       3.4

v1-3.problems:1.  dyspnea on exertion, progressive.2.  interstitial lung disease.3.  bilateral hilar adenopathy4.  weight loss5.  symptomatic hypercalcemia		nocturia		arthralgias		constipation		fatigue6.  prominent systolic murmur(s?). changes with maneuvers suggest this may be secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  there was evidence to suggest this on an echo from 2085, but obviously, need more recent data.7.  minimally elevated troponins.  uncertain significance.8.  anemia, mildly microcytic.9.  elevated ldh.10.  renal insufficiency, likely secondary to uncontrolled hypercalcemia.11.  history of hypertension.discussion:sarcoidosis, until proven otherwise.  she is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission.  the lung findings, systemic symptoms, hypercalcemia, anemia, abnormal serum ace level are all suggestive of this diagnosis.  her hypercalcemia is symptomatic and should be treated with volume repletion.  she should not receive diuretics at present.  long term treatment will be dependent on the underlying diagnosis and its treatment.  i think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and i expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first.  the cardiac murmur is impressive, but likely unrelated to the pulmonary disease.  we need echocardiogram to better define valvular function.  the minimally elevated troponins are not felt to be of clinical significance at this point.  appreciate cardiology input on this finding.  suggest:1.  stop hctz,avoid diuretics until fully volume repleted.2.  iv normal saline.  may need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach.3.  agree with check pth, vitamin d levels.4.  follow lytes, creatinine, calcium, hct.5.  agree with check echocardiogram.6.  we should ask the pulmonary service to see her in consultation.  bronchoscopy with biopsy may be the best way to obtain confirmatory tissue for diagnosis of sarcoidosis._____________________________________________edmond i. utterback, m.d.pager #57863internal medicine b attending
