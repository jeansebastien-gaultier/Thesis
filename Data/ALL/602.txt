diabetesmellitus , insulin dependent diabetes , hypertension , age , andelevated cholesterol , who was admitted to the cardiology serviceafter a syncope in vascular clinic. patient was in her usual stateof health while in vascular clinic , awaiting to discuss the resultsof arterial studies with her vascular surgeon , when she noted toslump over in the chair in the waiting room for about 1-2 minutes.she was unresponsive at the time. a code blue was called. by thetime the code team arrived to the scene , the patient was awake andalert , with a regular pulse. her blood pressure was noted to be inthe 140s. the patient did not recall an aura or a prodrome. shedenied any incontinence and aura or postictal confusion. she wastaken to the emergency department for evaluation , where she

andmanagement.her past medical history is as follows: 1. coronary arterydisease , status post multiple catheterizations in the past. hermost recent catheterization was in march of 2000 , which showed aproximal rca stenosis of 100% and a distal lad lesion of 40-50%.she was also noted to have luminal irregularities at the om-1 at asite of previous stenting. 2. peripheral vascular disease ,history of chronic ulcers , status post a left femoral to anteriortibial bypass graft; also , status post a patch angioplasty in theleft groin. 3. diabetes mellitus. hemoglobin a1c of 9% in marchof 2002. 4.

p.o.b.i.d. , and naprosyn 325 mg p.o. q. day. the patient has no knowndrug allergies.social history: she lives in arbafontpringsalb o land near her daughter. shespends most of her time at home. she does notsmoke and does not drink alcohol.physical exam on admission: she was afebrile. heart rate was 50and regular. blood pressure was140/80. respiratory rate was 20 , saturation of 98% on room air.she was a pleasant african american woman lying in bed. she hasher right eye closed. she had a surgical right pupil , with a leftcataract. her oropharynx was benign , her mucous membranes weremoist. she had no jugular venous distention. there was a questionof soft bilateral carotid bruits. the lungs revealed decreasedbreath sound at the left apex , but otherwise was clear toauscultation. cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate andrhythm , there were no murmurs appreciated in the emergencydepartment. the abdomen was soft , without hepatosplenomegaly. inthe extremities , there are incisional scars at the medial calves onboth legs , with 1+ dp pulses bilaterally , her legs were warm , andthere was no edema. on neuro exam , she was alert and oriented x 3 ,cranial nerves iii-xii were grossly normal , and her motor exam waswithout focal deficits.laboratories of note: her potassium was 3.8 , her bun was 39 , andher creatinine was 1.9 , her baselinecreatinine being anywhere between 1.7 and 2.0. glucose was 122.her troponin on admission was 0.32 , and of note , back in marchshe had also been admitted and was noted to have a troponin in the.3 range. her ck on this admission was 308 , with an mb fraction of3.9. calcium was 9.2 , magnesium was 2.7 , white blood cell count6.1 , hematocrit 36 , platelets 238. her ua was negative. her ekgshowed normal sinus rhythm at 85 , with left axis deviation ,evidence of lvh , left atrial enlargement , and some t waveflattening in v4 through 6 and t wave inversion in 1 and l. herchest x-ray was without infiltrate or pulmonary arterialcongestion.in summary , this is a 65-year-old woman with vasculopathy andextensive coronary artery disease , who presented with suddensyncope x 1-2 minutes. given the history , the story was veryconcerning for a malignant arrhythmia. she was admitted forfurther workup of ischemic or malignant arrhythmia causes of hersyncope.her hospital course is summarized by systems: 1. cardiovascular:the patient was placed on the monitor and no definitye symptomatic arrhythmiaswere observed. however , because of her demonstrated asymetricallyhypertrophied left ventricle and ergions of inferoposterior scar ,electrophysiology study was recommended ( see below and addendum ).the patient was initially admitted with a troponin of0.32 , which on repeat examination was 0.87. it wasthought to be consistent with a very small non-q-wave mi. she wasstarted on heparin for 48 hours. on 6/13/2002 , the patient had anadenosine mibi , which showed a moderate size lesion ofinferolateral and a small apical region of reversible ischemic.she had a cardiac catheterization on 8/10/2002 , which revealed an80% proximal circumflex lesion which was stented to 0%. she had anechocardiogram performed on 9/4/2002 , which showed a left atrium of 2.9 cm.she had asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy , with preserved overallsystolic function and an ejection fraction estimated to be 60%. this wasthought to be a potential source of focus for ventricular arrhythmias , andfurther supported the decision to go to electrophysiology study.2. pulmonary: one of the considerations entertained to explainthe patient's syncope was a potential pulmonary embolus. thoughshe had not been hypoxic on presentation , the sudden nature of theevent , as well as her tachycardia , was felt to warrant furtherworkup for a pe. she had a d-dimer sent , which came back at &gt;1000.she later had a vq scan which was read as low probability. lowerextremity noninvasive ultrasounds of both legs revealed nothrombus.3. endocrine: the patient has insulin dependent diabetesmellitus. we continued her morning nph dose and covered her withregular insulin sliding scale for the remainder of herhospitalization. her sugars were relatively well controlledthroughout.4. social/psych: the patient has a known difficult homesituation , with previous known problems with her son and otherfamily members. social services was involved. they interviewedthe patient and involved a consult to crest medical .  at thetime of this dictation , that evaluation is still pending.the final disposition of the patient is still pending at this time.i will complete this dictation at the time of discharge , includingthe patient's disposition and disposition medications.dictated by: garry
