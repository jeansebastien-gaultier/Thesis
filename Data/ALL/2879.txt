pericardial effusion. likely malignant. pericardiocentesiswas performed with approximately 250 cc of serosanguinous fluidoutput and normalization of right heart pressures. a pericardialdrain was placed with 320 cc of serosanguinous fluid output thefirst 12 hours, then 75 cc over 6 hours, then no output. arepeat echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusionwithout evidence of tamponade as above. the pericardial drainwas removed. an echocardiogram the next morning showed stablesmall pericardial effusion. cultures were negative at the timeof discharge and cytology was pending. the patient will have arepeat echocardiogram five days after discharge and willfollow-up with her oncologist. the patient may need apericardial window or balloon pericardiotomy procedure if theeffusion increases in size..2. infectious disease. the patient had a temperature to 100.8the second day of admission. the patient's only localizingsymptom was a nonproductive cough the patient has complained offor the past three weeks, overall improved since that time.chest x-ray showed atelectasis but no new consolidations.urinalysis negative for infection. urine, blood, and pericardialfluid cultures without growth at the time of discharge. thefever was likely secondary to atelectasis or the patient'sunderlying malignancy..3. breast cancer. the patient is now off the lapatinib study.the patient is followed by oncology..4. anemia. the patient's hematocrit remained stable at 31-36during admission. the patient's iron studies showed an iron totibc ratio of 5%, although ferritin was within normal
