angap-11imaging:ct head [10-9]:1. a large lesion in the right frontal lobe, measuring 6.8 x 5.2x 9 cm, seen to extend into the region of the frontal [doctor last name 534] ofthe right lateral ventricle, and in proximity to the septumpellucidum. given the large size and lack of priors, the exactsite of origin of the lesion is not clear. this can eitherrepresent a low-grade neoplasm vs a complex cyst, with thedifferential diagnosis including subependymoma, pleomorphicxanthoastrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, the latter two being lesslikely given the pattern of enhancement and lack ofcalcifications. an unusual complex cyst cannot be completelyexcluded. the lesion does appear to have some vascularity, withtiny vessels noted within the lesion. wet read was entered on[2164-10-9], soon after the study.ct head [10-11]:impression:1. expected post-surgical changes, status post right frontalmass removal.2. interval decrease of mass effect when compared to prior study([2164-10-11]). no hemorrhage or major vascular territorialinfarction is noted.mri head [10-12]:impression:1. no evidence of infarction.2. flair abnormality around the surgical resection margin may berelated to recent surgery, though residual tumor cannot beexcluded. while there is no abnormal enhancement, there is noenhancement of the tumor prior to surgery, so this cannot beused as metric.brief hospital course:patient presented to the [hospital1 18] ed after having an mri of herbrain for consistent headaches as an outpatient which showed herto have a right frontal mass which communicated with the rightlateral ventricle. she was evaluated by neuromedicine andneurosurgery in the ed and was admitted to the neurosurgeryservice. a cta/v was obtained to gain information on thevascularity of the mass. on the evening of [10-10] it was decidedthat she would undergo surgical resection of the mass viacraniotomy on the morning of [10-11].  she remained stable on thefloor overnight and on [10-11] was taken to the or for surgery.surgery was without complication. she was admitted to the icubut remained in the pacu overnight. post op ct revealed goodresection and no hemorrhage.on pod#1 she was neurologically intact. she was cleared fortransfer to the floor. post op mri was completed and alsorevealed excellent resection. pca was discontinued and she wasstarted on po pain meds with iv for breakthourgh. she didrequire some iv pain medication on [10-13] and remained on her poregimen. she was able to mobilize oob on this day and walkthrough the halls without difficulty. she was
