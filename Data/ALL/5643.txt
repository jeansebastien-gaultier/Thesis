his weight from 395 lb to 450 lb over the last 2-4 weeks. this occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. the weight gain

on arrival in the ed, his vs were: t98, bp108/65, rr24, hr100, o2sa 92% on 4l 02. he received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded. he was transferred to internal medicine for further management. pmh/psh: obstructive sleep apneacopdchf (ef in 2117: 53%)hyperlipidemiapulmonary hypertensionhtnniddmvenous stasis with chronic leg ulcersmorbid obesityperipheral neuropathys/p

increasing sob and abdominal discomfort. sob: most likely related to a combination of chf flare (due to lasix discontinuation, bnp 1326) and copd (pft in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit). cxr showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with chf.  started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs. will reevaluate cardiac function with tte. in the
