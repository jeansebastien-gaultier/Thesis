and some shortness ofbreath.  he denies chest pain or pressure, palpitations,vomiting, sweating.  he was noted to be altered by his wife withconcern re: difficulty speaking, perhaps a left sided facialdroop and possible left hemianopsia, but limited evidence forthis.  the patient denies having any difficultly speaking orvisual changes, but says that he was confused and seeing thingsthat weren't there.  his wife reported to the neurologist thathe never had a facial droop..he reports chronic doe, no cp at rest or with exercise, +claudication (calf pain) with ambulating 2 blocks, deniesorthopnea, sleeps on 4 pillows at night.  + pnd.  he reports leedema at baseline.  he lost 10 lbs over past 3 months, which heattributes to diet and exercise.he initially went to an osh, where ct head was negative.  he wasfound to have new [last name (un) ] and elevated cardiac enzymes.  he washypotensive at osh to sbp 80s, started on peripheral dopamineand sent to the ed.in the ed, initial vs were: 98.9 86 94/45 on dopamine 20 95%.he was also reporting worsening of chronic low back pain. hisexam was notable for [3-11] murmur, benign abdomen, rectal wasguaiac neg.  a bedside u/s in the ed was neg for pericardialeffusion.  cardiology consult was requested for stat echo in ed,to look for new wma, but was not performed.  ekg was not felt tobe markedly changed from baseline.   there was some concern foraortic aneurysm given back pain so he had a ct torso w/ocontrast, which was negative for aneurysm.  vascular wasconsulted and felt aortic dissection was unlikely.  neurologywas consulted for concern re: tia and they did not feel he had aprimary neurologic process.  due to persistent hypotension, arij was placed and he was started on levofed.  he was not givenany antibiotics

have hypotension, [last name (un) ] and elevated ce.# shock/hypotension: on arrival to the ed, patient's exam wasmost consistent with cardiogenic shock, with a prior known ef25-30%. he had no evidence of sepsis or hypovolemia on exam. hishypotension was likely triggered by new administration ofminoxidil causing hypotension and stress leading to stress anddemand ischemia.  home bp medications were held, and he wasstarted on levophed with a goal map of 55-60.  on admission tothe micu, an a-line was placed for monitoring of his bloodpressures. overnight in the micu he required increasing doses oflevophed to maintain blood pressure. his ce were trended,showing elevation of troponin and mild elevation in ck insetting of acute kidney injury and demand ischemia.  repeat echoshowed stable ef of 25-30%, rv free wall hypokinesis and apicalakinesis. the patient was transferred to the ccu for furthermanagement of cardiogenic shock.  levophed was transitioned todopamine and patient was started on lasix gtt for diuresis withgood result.  dopamine was weaned off on [2204-4-11].  throughouthospitalization, patient was maintained on therapeutic inr withcoumadin or with therapeutic ptt with heparin gtt given historyof recently diagnosed lv thrombus.  in setting of renal failure,patient was started on carvedilol on [2204-4-11] and was notrestarted on atenolol. as an outpatient, the patient should berestarted on [last name (un) ] and spironolactone as tolerated by bp andrecovery of kidney function.of note, noninvasive blood pressures were difficult to monitoron patient secondary to severe pvd.  carotid dopplers showedpossible subclavian steal on right, so bp should be monitored onleft.# coronaries: upon admission serial ekg showed nonspecific stchanges in the lateral leads, that were initially concerning foracs.  cardiac enzymes were trended, showing elevation oftroponin to 0.95 with only mild ck elevation in the setting ofworsened renal failure (see below) and cardiogenic shock.patient continued on asa, plavix and atorvostatin throughduration of hospitalization.  atenolol was held secondary torenal failure and hypotension, and was later transitioned tocarvedilol once cardiogenic shock had resolved. carvedilol doseuptitrated to 25mg [hospital1 ] by time of discharge but otheranti-hypertensives were held since bp had been so low atpresentation and had not yet rebounded to previously elevatedlevels.# acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease: patientadmitted with oliguric renal failure with cr elevated to 5.0from baseline of 2.6.  likely etiology secondary to atn in thesetting of his ongoing hypotension and poor forward flow.  renalwas consulted for help with management given his possible needfor catheterization and severe renal dysfunction.  kidneyfunction improved with initiation of dopamine and lasix gtt.home [last name (un) ] and atenolol were held given worsened renal function.renal function was trended daily with creatinine peaking at 6.5. on discharge had improved to 3.8 and was trending in the rightdirection but will be rechecked on monday at dr.[name (ni) 5452] office.# altered mental status/reported neurologic changes: presentedwith vague neurologic complaints of confusion, dysarthria, andfacial droop which had resolved by presentation to the ed.initially the patient was noted to have some waxing - [doctor last name 688]mental status thought to be secondary to toxic metabolicencephalopathy from azotemia and cerbral hypoperfusion fromhypotension.  neurologic exam was nonfocal and mental statusimproved through hospital course.  neurology was consulted andfelt that initial presentation was consistent with a tia.  forsecondary prevention,  risk factor management was optimized andpatient constinued on strict control of hypercholesterolemia,hypertension, and on antiplatelet agents. ha1c was found to be10.6. patient contined on coumadin to prevent embolic strokefrom known lv thrombus although this was held for a couple daysduring hospitalization while there was concern that proceeduremight be needed as below.# known lv thrombus: pt with history of lv thrombus documentedon prior tte. had been on warfarin as an outpatient but this washeld for a couple days as inpatient as concern that patientwould need additional invasive proceedures. placed on heparingtt to cover while inr subtherapeutic. warfarin was restarted 2days prior to d/c and inr climbing but only up to 1.8 on day ofd/c so pt administered one sub-cutaneous dose of 80mg enoxaparinon day of discharge and given script for one additional dose of80mg enoxaparin the next day. pharmacy was contact[name (ni) ] to confirmthat dosing should be 80mg daily for therapeuticanti-coagulation in setting of improving renal failure.# transaminitis: new this admission, likely secondary to poorforward flow given his presentation of hypotension.  trendedthrough hospital course and noted to be downtrending.# diabetes: type ii on insulin, on 75/25
