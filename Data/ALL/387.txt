(for cramping), nitroglycerin p.r.n., zoloft 15 mg p.o.h.s., lorazepam 15 mg p.o. q.h.s., magnesium oxide 250 mg p.o.q.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. p.r.n.  on examination she appears well.  weight is 142 pounds.  bloodpressure is 140/60.  heart rate is 50 and regular.  neck veinsare 6 cm above the mid right atrium.  there are bilateral carotidbruits.  lungs are resonant to percussion and clear toauscultation.  on cardiac exam the pmi is in the fifthintercostal space at the midclavicular line.  there is a 1+ leftventricular lift.  the first heart sound is normal.  the second  benitez, wonda                                    mrn: 89276954november 07, 2086              -2-  is split physiologically.  there is a grade 2/6 mid systolicmurmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur alongthe left sternal border.  there is a fourth heart sound at theapex.  abdominal examination reveals no masses, nohepatosplenomegaly.  extremities are notable for 2+ bilateralfemoral pulses, palpable bilateral tibial artery bypass graftpulses, absent bilateral popliteal pulses, 1+ right dorsalispedis, absent right posterior tibial and absent left pedalpulses. her electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia with first degreeav block and findings suggestive of a prior anterolateralmyocardial infarction.  there has been no diagnostic change sincejuly 18, 2086. carotid duplex ultrasound examination performed on october 31,2086 showed a 55% stenosis of the right internal carotid arteryand a 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.  thevelocity of the right internal carotid artery and the subsequentcalculation of stenosis was less than it had been in february2086.   graft scans obtained on october 31, 2086 demonstrated patent leftfemoral-anterior tibial artery bypass graft with increasedvelocities consistent with a greater than 75% stenosis at the midthigh level and this was increased from a study of august 06, 2086. the right femoral-dorsalis pedis arterial bypass graft was patentwith no evidence of significant stenoses.   in summary, her problems relevant to this visit include: 1.  coronary artery disease.  status post coronary artery bypasssurgery.  lima to the lad and svgs to the diagonal andposterolateral left ventricular branch.  she has occasional andvery transient episodes of angina.  i have suggested continuingher current medical regimen.  as noted previously, i prefer tomanage her medically unless her symptoms worsen.   2.  carotid artery disease.  she is asymptomatic.  i recommendperiodic surveillance with carotid ultrasound.  3.  peripheral arterial disease.  both grafts are patent but theleft femoral-anterior bypass graft appears by ultrasound to havea significant stenosis.  i have asked her to discuss this findingwith you further. benitez, wonda                                    mrn: 89276954november 07, 2086              -3-  4.  hypercholesterolemia.  a lipid profile will be checked today.   5.  systolic murmur and query antibiotic prophylaxis for dentalprocedures.  i am evaluating her murmurs, which were presumablyaortic sclerosis and mitral regurgitation, with anechocardiogram.   sincerely,   thomas waller, m.d. cc:terry w. neel, m.d.vascular surgerycooley dickinson hospital20 greenfield driveschuyler, fl  76969  tw/sanchez   not reviewed by attending physician
