blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  we will check a hemoglobin a1c today.  she is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.2.  cardiovascular.  she is doing well on her current regimen.  she is on ranolazine and will continue with this.3.  neck pain.  intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  i did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  i did encourage her to actually take some naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  she has had some problems with some blood in the stool and i feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  i did recommend that she get one in the near future.

stool.______________________________iva p hall, mdescription document:9-9269277 cssten teldd: 04/19/87dt: 04/19/87dv: 04/07/87
