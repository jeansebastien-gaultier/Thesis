ldh 43; ldl 166.hospital course: ms. talburt was admitted for a rule out myocardialinfarction protocol and underwent serialelectrocardiograms and her enzymes were studied. she was startedon nitrol paste. aspirin , linsinopril , and atenolol , werecontinued. given her low hematocrit as a possible etiology forher ischemia , she was transfused with one unit of packed red cells.stools were guaiac neg and anemia workup was initiated. she wascontinued on her albuterol inhale and nebulizers p.r.n.on february , 1997 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterizationwhich showed a 70% residual osteal diagonal stenosis , 0% leftanterior descending stenosis. a stent was placed in the diagonalartery with 0% residual stenosis. later than evening , the patientbegan to complain of severe left arm pain radiating to her leftchest. her electrocardiogram changes showed st elevation in vi andvii , and t-wave more inverted in viv. she received morphine andwas already on a nitroglycerin drip , and she was taken back to thecatheterization laboratory. her spectral study on february ,1997 , revealed a 90% mid left anterior descending and 95% vi , andher left anterior descending was stented at this time.following her two cardiac catheterizations , she experiencedintermittent atypical chest which was transient in nature withoutsustaining any electrocardiogram changes. her cardiac enzymes weresignificant for a ck of 409 with an mb fraction o 21.on march , 1997 , it was noted that her creatinine had risen to3.1 , elevated from a level of 1.9 before the catheterization and adiagnosis of radial contrast induced nephrotoxicity was made. hercreatinine rose and rose to a peak level of 5.1 on march ,1997 , and then began to decrease. at the time of discharge , it wasdown to 2.2. the patient continued to have excellent urine outputthroughout the rise in her creatinine and was normal by the time ofdischarge.her laboratories at the time of discharge were a sodium of 141;potassium 4.8; chloride 106; bicarbonate 20; bun 31; creatinine2.2; glucose 90. white count 6900; hematocrit 33.9; platelets were203 , 000. she had an exercise tolerance test and ed study onnovember , 1997 , which showed an essentially negative exercisetreadmill test and was a suboptimal study. she exercised forapproximately five minutes on submaximal exercise treadmill testprotocol with no evidence of ischemia , but low exercise tolerance.her medications at the time of discharge included: ticlid 250 mgp.o. b.i.d.; albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d. as needed forshortness of breath; enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.;atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.; nitroglycerin 1/150 sublingual onetablet q. 5 minutes times three for chest pain; and dilantin 200 mgp.o. b.i.d.she is scheduled to followup with dr. doug millis in her officein one week and will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.dictated by: cleveland princevalle , m.d. ip95attending: coleman hoyland , m.d. xf78  gc702/3343batch: 29248 index no. dpixvyl69 d: 10/28/97t: 10/12/97[report_end]
