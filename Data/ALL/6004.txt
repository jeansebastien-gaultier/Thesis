found to be unresponsiveat her nursing home, intubated for hypercarbic respiratorydistress, found to be hypothermic in ed, hyperna, and w/fluctuating bps..# hypercarbic respiratory distress: patient with copd on 2l homeo2, w/ elevated bicarb from nursing home a week ago and likelyco2 retainer.  her ph suggests compensated process and elevatedbicarb suggest that her respiratory status likely hasdeteriorated over a chronic period of time due to worseningcopd.  although cxr was not notable for pna, cta showed somesuggestion of retrocardiac opacities and sputum w/ gram positivecocci on gram stain.  pe was ruled out w/ cta.  patient wastreated for hcap (vancomycin, levofloxacin and cefepime), alongwith standing nebulizers.  there was difficulty controlling heranxiety with recurrent hyperventilation on pressure support.initial extubation attempt on [2-20] failed due to tachypnea, lowminute ventilation and eventually hypercarbic respiratoryfailure.  patient was continued on hcap coverage and started onsteroids for copd exacerbation and marked bronchospasm onexamination.  tte showed a moderate pericardial effusion w/osigns of tamponade with diastolic dysfunction.  patientunderwent iv diuresis.a major barrier to her extubation was felt to be anxiety leadingto tachypnea, in addition to above factors.  she was tried onmultiple sedative and antipsychotics and best regiment was feltto be clonazepam 0.5mg [hospital1 ] (prior attempted medications w/osignificant improvement - xanax, ativan, zydis, seroquel).per [hospital1 2177] records, baseline abg was confirmed to be7.33-37/70-80/39/80-100.patient was extubated on [2-26]. she tolerated this well, howeverwas noted to be very sensitive to hyperoxia (as during nebulizertreatments or increased supplemental oxygen) with resultanthypercarbia, resp. distress (requiring return to icu though nointubation).  this improved w/ reduction of supplemental o2. shewas restarted on antibiotics with vancomycin, levofloxacin,cefepime though there was no cxr evidence of recurrentpneumonia.  she was narrowed to levofloxacin and remainedafebrile and stable.  her goal o2 sat should be 88-92 to preventresultant hypercarbia and acidosis.  patient's advair dosing wasincreased to 500/50 and tiotropium was restarted w/ albuterolinhalers.  nebulizers were discontinued seondary to hyperoxia asabove.  patient was stable on 1.5l nc at the time of discharge,sat'ing 88-96%.  patient will continue levofloxacin through[2169-3-10] for total 8 days treatment.# altered mental status: patient recieved number of sedatingmedications per nursing home records, which in addition tohypercarbia could have contributed to her mental status changes. patient w/ leukocytosis and hypothermia on admission, thoughinfectious w/o negative.  labs also notable for hyperna, andappeared volume depleted by exam.  cta head/neck unremarkable,and neuro exam in non-focal.  seizure seemed unlikely given theabove factors.  no meningeal signs on exam.  urine and bloodcultures were negative; sputum culture positive as above. sodiumwas corrected.  much of this was felt to be due to transienthypercarbia and benzodiazapines.  at time of discharge, patientwas alert and oriented x 3.  she was tolerated clonazepam 0.5mgqam and qhs.# bacterial pneumonia: hypothermic in ed 92.5 and patient w/leukocytosis.  lactate mildly elevated.  hypotensive in the ed,but normotensive in icu.  see above for further discussion.patient completed vancomycin and zosyn course for hcap. onreturn to the icu, concern for rll pneumonia, so patient wasrestarted on antibiotics, vancomycin and levofloxacin.  patientwas narrowed to levofloxacin and is now day [5-12], should be dosedthrough [2169-3-10].# copd with exacerbation: discontinued nebulizers secondary torespiratory distress in setting of hyperoxia. albuterol inhaleras needed and daily tioptrium restarted per home regimen.patient is on a long steroid taper, currently 30mg po daily,with plan to decrease weekly by 10mg (next decrease saturday[2169-3-12]).# pericardial effusion:  noted on prior osh records.  tte hereshowed moderate effusion that seemed unchanged on repeat tte.# htn: blood pressure controlled with home amlodipine andaddition of lisinopril 2.5mg po daily.# transitional issues:- discontinue levofloxacin after [2169-3-10] (8 day course started[3-3])- goal o2 sat 88-92% (patient has been reaching this goal with1.5l nc)- avoid nebulizers as high flow oxygen has worsened respiratorydistress, patient is stable on albuterol inhalers and
