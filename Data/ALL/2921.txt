dr. ila araujochief complaintfallhistory of the present illness                pt is an 88 yo woman with a pmh of dm, htn, mild dementia and baseline anxiety with a hx of falls who was admitted following a witnessed mechanical fall which resulted in a type iii dens fracture and r superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. she was seen by ortho, and they recommended use of an aspen collar for the dens fracture, and no operative management for the pubic ramus fracture.  on 11/15, patient was noted to have a decreased hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 u of prbcs from 9:30am-5pm on 11/15.  overnight her o2 requirement increased from 2l to 4l, and she was given lasix in response to a chest x-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.  throughout the day patient became progressively more agitated, and in addition to her standing seroquel (12.5 mg bid), she was also given two doses of zyprexa (2.5mg and 5mg).  overnight on 11/15-11/16 she became febrile, up to 103.5, peaking at 105.6 in the morning on 11/16, despite standing tylenol.  blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and patient was started on levoquin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and transferred to team e.review of systemsper hpipast medical historydm &#8211; diet controlled htn hypothyroidism hx of post-op dvt (&gt;40 years ago after a

unable to obtain because of pt&#8217;s tremor.  when more calm, ekg was irregular, no acute st or t wave changes.            assessment and plan                88 yo female with a pmh of dm, htn, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.issue #1: fever and tremors.  differential includes infection, seizure, nms or serotonin syndrome.  a temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.  an lp will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.  in the context of recently receiving seroquel, zyprexa and fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated ck, elevated wbc, elevated lfts, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.continue to follow lytes, ck, cbc small doses of ativan for tremor/anxiety avoid all neuroleptics (typical and atypical) continue antibiotics, f/u culturesissue #2: type iii dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.keep in c collar, manage rami fracture medicallyissue #3: dm.  continue fsgs and riss.issue #4: anemia.  continue to follow hct and monitor hematoma on r thighpropylaxisdvt: teds, pneumobootsbowel: colace, senna prncode:  full
