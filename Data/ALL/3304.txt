admission date :2009-11-10discharge date :2009-11-12service :ccuhistory of present illness :the patient is a 61 - year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease , status post 5-vessel coronary artery bypass graft on 2009-09-11 , who presents for elective right heart catheterization and pericardiocentesis .the patient did well after his coronary artery bypass graft .on 10-14 , the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a new , moderate-to-large sized pericardial effusion .the patient was asymptomatic at this time , and the decision was made to monitor him and to start him on lasix .the patient had follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram on 11-04 which revealed a slightly large effusion .a few days later , on 11-07 , the patient began to develop dyspnea on exertion with normal activity .he also noted a new two to three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .on 11-08 , he had an episode of acute shortness of breath with chest pressure which he describes as different from his typical angina with minimal exertion .the patient spoke with his cardiologist who referred him for pericardiocentesis for persistent and symptomatic pericardial effusion .on right heart catheterization , the patient was noted to have elevated right-sided and left-sided filling pressures with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 and a right atrial pressure of 16 .after 600 cc of serosanguineous pericardial fluid was removed , the patient was noted to have a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 9 and a right atrial pressure of 2 ; indicating resolution of tamponade physiology .hospital course :the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit after his therapeutic pericardiocentesis .he was hemodynamically stable and without any complaints .he was continued on his home cardiac regimen , but was started on indomethacin for post pericardiotomy syndrome .over the course of the night the patient drained an additional 400 cc of serosanguineous fluid from his pericardial drain pouch .by the next morning , the degree of drainage had decreased considerably with only 60 cc drained over six hours .the patient had a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram prior to drain removal which revealed the following :a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion one day post pericardiocentesis with no change from the study immediately post pericardiocentesis .the pericardial drain was removed without any difficulty .the pericardial fluid bag was removed without any difficulty with the decision to monitor the patient overnight and repeat the echocardiogram prior to discharge .the patient had an enlarged left pleural effusion which was noted to layer on a lateral decubitus film .we decided to perform a therapeutic thoracentesis .the patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion , and 1150 cc of fluid were drained .a chest x-ray was obtained post thoracentesis which revealed a significant decrease in the size of the left pleural effusion .no evidence of pneumothorax .on the morning of admission the patient had a markedly improved lung examination with increased air movement in the left base .he denied any shortness of breath and had oxygen saturations in the 90 s on room air .he had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a trivial / physiologic pericardial effusion .the patient was without any complaints and remained stable .
