noting that it was particularly bad when he was standing and concentrating on a particular task such as shaving. the dizziness was alleviated by him lying down. he added that he began feeling dizzy during the storm last week when his drinking water was contaminated.  he drank tap water until he was told it was undrinkable, then he stopped. he later developed diarrhea while not drinking any water and only having occasional coca-cola beverages. during these 2 weeks of dizziness, mr. ishida notes he felt that he lost 3-4 days of his life, saying that he was either knocked out or unconscious. he came to this conclusion b/c his medication box was still full for the previous 3 days; supporting his reflection by saying he rarely ever misses his medication. mr. ishida states that the room was not spinning and said that his dizziness was more like &#8220;lightheadness.&#8221; he feels that his problems began when taking tylenol- 2 weeks ago and cannot identify any other medication that is associated with his symptoms. mr. ishida says he&#8217;s never experienced any dizziness before, and hoped his symptoms would subside if he just stayed in bed. mr. ishida also described an increased pressure in his head, saying, &#8220;it felt as if my eyes and ears were going to explode.&#8221;

200 ms, qrs&lt; 110 ms, qtc&gt;470assessmentmr. ishida is a 78 y/o m with h/o ckd, htn, and niddm p/w sustained dizziness and altered mental status. mr. ishida is most likely currently in a volume depleted stated. he had diarrhea induced by the contaminated water from the storm and only maintained his hydration with a meager 2 or 3 bottles of coca-cola over several days. this in combination with his output of fluid from diarrhea, his diuretic medication, and possible osmotic diuresis (increased serum glucose level from soda intake in a diabetic) could have shifted him into hypovolemia. thus mr. ishida might have decrease effective arterial volume causing his bun/cr ratio to be elevated, indicating a prerenal process. although bun/cr ratio is not &gt;20, we can still assume that he has prerenal arf considering his use of diuretics and h/o ckd which can decrease the sensitivity of bun/cr rations and fena for assessing etiologies of renal failure. mr. ishida additionally uses nsaids (e.g. naproxen), an arb and an acei, all of which are associated with decreased intraglomerular pressure and renal vasoconstriction which can lead to prerenal arf.intrinsic arf is less likely considering he is not using any overtly nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphotericin, cisplatin, or aminoglycosides. conversely, he is at an increased risk of cholesterol emboli given his h/o of hypercholesterolemia and vasculopathy.      lastly, mr. ishida my have a postrenal arf etiology considering his h/o bph which could lead to obstruction of the outflow tract leading to increased pressures in the ureters flowing back up into the kidneys.      mr. ishida&#8217;s dizziness and altered mental status are both explained by arf. additional explanations of altered mental status are ruled out via the history and physical including intoxication, brain hemorrhagic, brain tumor, etc.plan#) acture renal failure-continue fluids and hydration: 1l of iv saline over the next 24 hrs-d/c naproxen use.-rule out post-renal etiology: use ultrasound to assess the size of the bladder and ureters. if enlarged bladder and ureters are found the diagnosis is more likely postrenal arf due to an enlarged prostate. thus the patient should be assessed by urology of possible partial prostatectomy.#) dm-discontinue metformin due to possibility of metabolic acidosis and hospital drug interactions.#) cad      -switch atenlol to metoprolol given arf#) htn-discontinue lisinopril, valsartan, furosemide until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves.#) gout      -d/c allopurinol until pt&#8217;s renal condition improves#)hypercholesterolemia-continue simvastatin as previously prescribed (simvastatin  20 mg po qhs)#) psoriasis-continue ammonium lactate 12% cream and calcipotriene 0.005%   top bid prn#)benign prostate hypertrophy      -continue finasteride and darifenacin as previously prescribed._________________________william yates, msiiipager #66612
