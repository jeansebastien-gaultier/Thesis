sweed , zane mdprincipal diagnosis: mrsa-infected abdominal mesh.history of present illness: this is a 90+-year-old male with acomplex past medical history including cad status post stent x2 ,hypertension , chf with an ef of 10-20% , af , on chronicanticoagulation , status post pacer placement , and diabetesmellitus who presented to the sicu status post exploratorylaparotomy for removal of chronically mrsa-infected mesh fromprior abdominal surgery. he was admitted to the icu forcareful monitoring and fluid volume managementpostoperatively. he has had multiple abdominal surgeries. themesh was originally placed for ventral hernia repair in 2005. hehad since developed draining sinus tracts for which cultures havegrown out mrsa. he was admitted preoperatively for reversal ofanticoagulation and semi-urgent removal of the mesh. in theoperating room , he underwent an exploratory laparotomy , lysis ofadhesions and removal of the abdominal mesh. he was closed andone jackson-pratt drain was left in place. during the procedure ,he was intubated with etomidate , succinylcholine and kept sedatedwith versed and fentanyl. he received intraoperative vancomycinand levofloxacin as well as 2200 ml of lactated ringer's. in anattempt to reverse anticoagulation , one unit of ffp was begun butthen aborted due to hypotension , which resolved with epinephrineinjection , likely due to transfusion reaction. another unit offfp was hung and tolerated well. ebl was 300 ml. urine outputwas 410 ml for the four-hour case. he was extubated uneventfullyand transferred to the icu in stable condition.past medical history:1. colon cancer , status post colonoscopy in 2005 that wasnegative.2. prostate cancer.3. history of cva with a left occipital infarct thought to bedue to

including cad status post mi and stent x2 ,chf was admitted to the sicu , status post ex lap for removal ofmrsa-infected mesh for careful monitoring and fluid resuscitationin light of cardiac status. his postoperative course wasremarkable for bleeding with sanguinous output from the jp drain ,a question of an abdominal hematoma and a progressive drop in hishematocrit. the heparin drip , which was initiated given thepatient's chronic af , was discontinued and ffp administered.platelets were also given at the request of the plastic surgeryteam in light of aspirin and plavix , which were continued due tothe patient's cardiac stents. despite bolus lasix , the patientdid develop chf with symptomatic pulmonary edema and increasedoxygen requirement. concomitantly , the patient also becamedelirious , as is his historical pattern with significant agitation.he developed hypertension refractory to beta-blockade , calciumchannel blockers and iv ace inhibitors in this setting. thepatient was thus placed on a nitroglycerin drip , a furosemidedrip with ginger blood product resuscitation to address bleedingand an elevated inr. he responded well to this regimen andaggressive pulmonary toilet. both the patient's pcp , dr.gillice , and his cardiologist , dr. keks , did follow thepatient. his oxygenation never suffered during this time and hedid not have significant hypercarbia. he was eventually weanedback to nasal cannula. he did have a mild transient elevation increatinine while on the lasix drip but has since recovered backto baseline off of the lasix drip. his nasogastric tube wasremoved on 5/18/06 and he tolerated ice chips withoutdifficulty. his home cardiac medications were restarted on6/10/06. the patient was out of bed and ambulating withoutdifficulty. at the time of dictation , his nitroglycerin drip wasbeing weaned with the assistance of nitro paste. he isanticipated to be transferred to the floor once he receives a redblood cell transfusion and once the nitroglycerin drip is off.plan:neuro:1. the patient does sundown at home and has done so while inthe icu. he has been much more calm and appropriate over thepast 24 to 36 hours.2. he does experience more significant delirium with morphineand less so with sparing dilaudid p.r.n.3. we will continue with sparing dilaudid p.r.n. , and zyprexa2.5 at bedtime p.r.n. per home
