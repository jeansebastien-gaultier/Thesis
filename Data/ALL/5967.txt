one looked inside your large intestine, and theother looked inside your stomach. the study that looked insideyour stomach showed that there were some spots in your stomachlining that had eroded away, and were bleeding..you have been taking coumadin (also called warfarin), ablood-thinning medicine that is important for you because youhave mechanical heart valves. coumadin helps to prevent strokesin people with these heart valves. but coumadin can also make iteasier to bleed. it is likely that with too high a coumadinlevel, the erosions in your stomach bled more than they wouldhave otherwise..you should continue to take the coumadin, and to get your bloodchecked regularly. your doctor or nurse may need to change thedosage in order to make sure the coumadin level is correct..sometimes leafy green vegetables can lower your coumadin level.if eating leafy green vegetables is important in your diet, talkto your doctor about trying to find ways that you can eat yourvegetables and have a stable coumadin level. for now, avoidleafy green vegetables like kale and collard greens until youcan discuss this with your doctor.followup instructions:make an appointment with dr [last name (stitle) ] as soon as possible-- theyneed to check your blood levels of coumadin, the blood thinner.make an appointment with the gastrointestinal clinic for onemonth from now.
