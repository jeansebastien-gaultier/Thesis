record date: 2097-08-18msh adult medicine office visit                              pcp dr whitehead73 yr old woman with htn, sp cabg, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal mra done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high k.she was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.  at that time she was told to dc lisinopril and vioxx.  her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early august her k+ rose a bit.  the vna has been seeing her at home.  according to the patient her bp has been "normal".she and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal mra.  they are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her pcp.  she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.  appetite is good.she has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about k+ content of many foods.she has been taking lisinopril at the same dose since her cbg in 2095 and has been taking nsaids for fibromyalgia for several years.medicationsasa (acetylsalicylic acid) 650mg tablet ec take 1 tablet(s) po qd mvi (multivitamins) 1 capsule po qd ntg 1/150

    according to discharge summary of hospitalization in 7/97, urine was negative for eosinophils.a:  73 yr old with htn has had deterioration of renal function since 2095 when she began taking acei concomitantly with nsaid.  the cause for more acute deterioration of renal function in 7/2097 and again in early august is unclear.she has not been taking any nsaid including otc forms. i don't think the moderate renal artery stenosis is a significant contributor to renal dysfunction and her bp is reasonable off the acei.  p:  her daughter had many questions about what this type of "blockage" means and about prognosis.  i attempted to explain the differences between renal perfusion, renal function, and to advise her about the role/impact of acei for bp and her heart (her daughter is worried that her heart will suffer if she doesn't take the acei).  i told her that it is unsafe for her to take any nsaid. i suggested that a renal specialist would be helpful in determining the role of renal artery disease in her renal dysfunction.provided her with detailed lists of low and high k+ foods.check lytes, renal function, phos, ca and alb today.will discuss nephrology consultation with dr whitehead.she has an appt with dr whitehead on 8/27.length of visit was 45 minutes._____________________________________________carole b. holland, m.d.
