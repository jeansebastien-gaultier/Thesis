monforeadmission diagnosis:congestive heart failure.principal discharge diagnoses:1. congestive heart failure.2. diastolic dysfunction.3. hypertension.4. diabetes mellitus.5. serratia uti.6. chronic renal dysfunction.7. dyslipidemia.8. coronary artery disease.9. mild pulmonary hypertension.10. mitral regurgitation.allergies:penicillins.brief history of present illness:the patient is a pleasant 78-year-old gentleman who presents withshortness of breath and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea forapproximately three weeks. he has a history of coronary arterydisease with an mi in 1994 and four-vessel cabg with subsequentlyplaced five stents in 2002 for graft and native vessel stenosis ,hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency with a baselinecreatinine of 2.8 , diabetes mellitus ( insulin dependent ) ,hyperlipidemia , and a pace maker for symptomatic bradycardia. heis presented with three weeks of increasing orthopnea , dyspnea ,and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with rare chest tightnesswithout radiation and onset of symptoms mainly while recumbent.he presents after coming to an outside hospital with three tofour days of these worsening symptoms. he was transferred tobaspit hospital where he received most of hiscardiac care. the patient had these worsening heart failuresymptoms after a trip to i hwy , ny vale , michigan 34152 , some dietary indiscretion anda five-pound weight gain. he has had no syncope , palpitations ,but has had some mild nausea without emesis. at the outsidehospital when he presented , his ekg showed a baseline leftbundle-branch block and had a troponin of 0.13. he was givensome lasix and had echocardiogram , had initially revealed anejection fraction of 35%. he was transferred to me ale firstray hospital , started on a nitroglycerin drip as well as aheparin drip for presumed coronary artery disease , a repeatechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 50% , anterior walldistal dyskinesis from an old myocardial infarction andmoderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. this is consistent withan echocardiogram that he received in 1/8 . uponpresentation , the patient was afebrile , had a heart rate of 82 ,blood pressure of 138/64 and was sating 96% on 5 liters of nasalcanula. his jugular venous pressure was 7 cm. his lungs hadrales bilaterally , approximately half way up. he had nodullness. his heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the leftaxilla. he had no s3 , and no s4. his abdomen was mildlydistended. he had no fluid waves and positive bowel sounds. hisextremities were warm. he had no pedal edema and 1+ dorsalispedis pulses bilaterally. ekg at baneers hospitalrevealed a dual chamber pacemaker with left bundle-branch patternand no significant st wave changes and an occasional pvc.admission laboratories:significant for a creatinine of 3.1 , a bun of 76 , potassium of5.3 , his hematocrit was 29.4 , and pt-t was 56 on heparin drip.brief resume of hospital course:1. ischemia. the patient has an extensive history of coronaryartery disease. he is maintained on aspirin , plavix , low dosebeta-blocker with carvedilol as well as ace inhibitor and statin.he initially came in with a troponin of 0.13 , which was felt asdemand ischemia related to systemic hypertension and pulmonaryhypertension. his enzymes trended down and were negative afterthe initial check. eventually , the patient received 48 hours ofintravenous heparin as well as iv nitroglycerin and was chestpain free. at this point , he received an adenosine mibi nuclearstudy , which revealed a known distal anterior wall scar with avery small surrounding region of reversible ischemia that wasfelt to be nonrevascularizable. he was maintained on optimummedical management with the caveat that cardiac catheterizationin this gentleman who had already had previous history of renaldysfunction with a creatinine rise to nearly 7 with a dye loadwas not warranted nor indicated at this time. by discharge , hewas ambulating halls and was chest tightness free. coronaryartery disease was felt to be a noncontributory factor to his chfexacerbation.2. pump. the patient had an ejection fraction of 45% uponadmission with moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. he wasinitially diuresed approximately 3 liters with a combination oflasix and natrecor. at this point , his pulmonary edema hadresolved and his oxygen requirement was decreased. given thefact of his tenuous renal status , we wanted to avoid furtherdiuresis or after-load reduction until we knew exactly what hisright and left heart filling pressures were. the patient wastaken to the cardiovascular diagnostic laboratory and received aright heart catheterization. his pulmonary capillary wedgepressure was determined to be 16 and his pulmonary arterypressure 56/18. his ra pressure was 8. there was some initialfalse elevation because of inadequate sedation while in the cathlab , and the patient was transferred for 48 hours of tailoredtherapy to the cardiac care unit where he had a pulmonary arterycatheter in place. at this point , his after-load reduction wasmaximized with combination of hydralazine and isordil with goodeffect. his creatinine decreased with after-load reduction to2.7. his symptoms improved and we were able to diurese another 2liters of the patient. by discharge , the patient was actuallybecoming hypertensive again and he was started on amlodipine , acalcium channel blocker , which he has tolerated in the past. ofnote , the patient has been exposed to ace inhibition in the pastand is currently not on an ace inhibitor. in the past , he hadhad a rise in his potassium to 5.5 on ace inhibition. on anoutpatient basis in the future , we would suggest the patient havea trial of ace or arb to optimize his after-load reduction andneurohormonal activation with his heart failure. the patient'sheart failure regimen includes standing lasix , carvedilol ,isordil and hydralazine , as well as digoxin for symptomaticimprovement.3. rhythm. the patient has a dual-chambered pacemaker. he wasmaintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. hiselectrolytes were replete and he is on a low-dose beta-blocker.he had a few rounds of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia lessthan 8 beats every time during his hospital stay. the patient isnot at this time a candidate for resynchronization biventricularpacer therapy because his ejection fraction of 45% , even if hisqrs interval is greater than 150 ms.4. pulmonary. given the fact that the patient had a normalpulmonary capillary wedge pressure and elevated pulmonary arterypressures , a brief investigation of pulmonary parenchymal diseasewas undertaken. he had a high resolution chest ct , which showedmild ground glass infiltrate at the bases consistent withpulmonary edema and no evidence of interstitial process. he alsohad pulmonary function tests. pulmonary function tests revealedan fvc of 1.88 liters and an fev1 of 1.33 liters. this gives anfev1 to fvc percent of 71%. he has both decreased fvc and fev1 ,but an fev1 and fvc percent that is most consistent with a mildrestriction. his lung volumes are approximately 50% predictedsuggestive of a restrictive process and his dlco both correctedand uncorrected are 50% predicted. his corrected dlco is 13.5.it is unclear if the patient has underlying restrictive lungdisease given the absence of definitive interstitial process onhigh resolution chest ct. a more likely explanation for thesefindings is a residual pulmonary edema relating to inadequatediuresis with his congestive heart failure. the patient wassating 98% on room air at the time of discharge.5. endocrine. the patient has very difficult to controldiabetes mellitus , and was maintained on both nph and lisprosliding scale while in house. he was briefly hypoglycemic duringhis initial hospital course because of a urinary tract infection.this resolved after approximately 24 hours of holding hislong-acting insulin and giving him glucose replacement therapy.he was euglycemic on 15 and 10 of nph in the a.m. and p.m.respectively as well as a lispro scale at the time of discharge.furthermore , the patient was found to have a tsh of 0.219 as wellas a normal t4 , this is suggestive of clinical hypothyroidism ,which is consistent with over replacement with synthroid such asmaintenance synthroid dose is decreased from 75 mcg to 60.5 mcgand we recommend a tsh to be checked in late february 2004.6. renal. the patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiencypresumably due to a combination of diabetes and hypertension. hehas had adverse reaction to contrast dye in the past with acreatinine bump to nearly 7. we wanted to avoid as much contrastdye as possible during this hospital stay because of his renalinsufficiency. we ended up re-dosing his digoxin to three timesweekly from every other day because of the dig level of 0.19.his creatinine was 2.7 and falling at the time of discharge andhis bun was 67. he was making good urine and had no evidence ofresidual urinary tract infection.7. infectious disease. upon presentation , the patient after afoley was placed became a little delirious and hypoglycemic.urine cultures grew out greater than 100 , 000 colonies of serratiamarcescens and he was given a 14-day course of renally dosedlevofloxacin with good resolution of his symptoms.8. neuropsych. the patient has a history of depression and hadsome mild delirium in the setting of urinary tract infection ,which resolved with p.r.n. zyprexa as well as treating of theunderlying condition. psychiatric service was consulted and feltlike he had a resolving medical delirium and there is noindication for further pharmacal or psychodynamic therapy at thistime. ( his mild subclinical hyperthyroidism may have contributedto his low mood as apathetic hyperthyroidism in a gentleman ofthis age is not uncommon. )9. prophylaxis. the patient was maintained on nexium for giprophylaxis and subcutaneous heparin for dvt prophylaxis.code status:the patient is full code.the patient was consulted by both physical therapy andoccupational therapy who felt that acute rehabilitation would bewarranted at this time.disposition:the patient was discharged in stable condition on room air andwas chest pain free to the irbar medical center the patient's health care proxy is his wife , mrs.blake maker , whose phone number is ( 158 ) 000-3426. he willbe followed by dr. valentine cloer at as medical centerschedule appointments with dr. jo ( 703 ) 219-1739. the patient's primary care physician is dr. arthur widener at ( 865 ) 227-2987. the patient should be maintained on afluid-restricted diet of less than 2 liters of fluid total. heshould have low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat as well as adiabetic diet with ada 2100 calories per day. he should also besodium restricted to less than 2 g daily. activity to be guidedby physical therapy at noneto do:1. titrate amlodipine p.r.n. the patient has tolerated up to 10mg amlodipine in the past.2. consider outpatient trial of ace inhibitor or arb in thefuture with close monitoring of potassium.3. recheck tsh late february 2004.4. complete former days of antibiotics for serratia urinarytract infection.discharge condition:stable.discharge medications:1. tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. headache.2. vitamin c 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
