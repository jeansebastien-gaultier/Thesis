record date: 2083-08-24 fellow/npnonereason for visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. stage ivb diagnosis/treatment summary: stage ivb (axillary and retroperitoneal ln and very large celiac axis ln mass) history:  patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.  on 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a colonoscopy, so his pcp suggested he have an ugi endoscopy at the same time.  the colonoscopy demonstrated diverticulosis and the ugi endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  on 8/10/83 an abd and pelvic ct were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on fe replacement. also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  on 8/10/83 a chest ct revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  this is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (l) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  the appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  there is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (r) major fissure in the lung. pet scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. the lung nodule was too small for pet to evaluate. he remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well. problems/pmh:repair of zenker's diverticulum in 2080aterial stent was placed in the mid lad in 4/80hypercholesteremiaarthritisborderline diabeticheart murmur for 50 yearsfh/sh:never marriedno childrennever smokedrare etoh- 6 beers per yearaerospace engineer for 40 yearsno family history of cancerhere with sister.review of systems: general: 20 lb weight loss,  fatigue, no fevers, no chills, can't eat as much, fills up quicklyrespiratory: no cough, no sob, no doe, no hemoptysis, no wheezingheent: no neck swelling, occasional (r) neck stiffness, no hoarseness, no hearing losscardiac: no chest pain, no palpitations( heart murmur for 50 yrs.) arrythmias, no valve diseasegastrointestinal: no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation, no bleedingneurologic: no seizures, no headache, no weakness, no numbness/tinglinglymph nodes: no enlarged lymph nodesmusculoskeletal: no back pain, no neck pain, no leg pain, no arm painurologic: no hematuria, no dysuria, or no obstructionendocrine: no adrenal, no thyroid or  no parathyroid diseasehematologic: no bruising, no clotting, no bleedingmedications:atenolol 50 mg qdtriamterene/hctz 50/25 qdvitamin b complex 100 u qdfolic acid 1 mg qdiron sulfate 1 tab bidlipitor 10 mg qhsterazosin 5 mg qdlisinopril 2.5 mg qhsducolax 2 tabs qdallergies:codeine-dizzyphysical examination: vss afps=1neck: no nodes palpableheent: no thrush or mucositis; eomi; perrlskin: no rashext: without edema, clubbingcor: s1 s2chest: clear lungs without wheezing or cracklesabdomen: soft, nt no hsmnodes: neg cerv, scneuro: grossly non-focaldata (laboratory and radiographs) see aboveassessment and plan:72 year old man with stage ivb metastatic esophageal cancer. he is doing quite well. given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. after radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, i will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. if he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. if the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. he is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.rtc in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans._____________________________________________xavier otero, m.d.cc: dr. geno guidrydr. gregory mcguire
