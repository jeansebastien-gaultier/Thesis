sob in the ambulance.  in the ed, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.  she initially required bipap with o2 sats of 93%.  she was given prednisone, levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.  of note, she was also noted to have mild st changes on her ekg while she was tachycardic to the 120s.  she received asa, lopressor and ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated ck and ck-mb but negative troponin at 0.03.  her ekg improved with rate control w/ iv lopressor.  she was also given 30mg iv lasix given some mild le edema to which she put out 200cc urine.  she is now admitted to the floor for further management of her sob.ros:   no f/c, + ns.  improving appetite. no cp/palpitations/orthopnea/pnd/claudication, + le edema for the

trans-mitral valve gradient. given patient's history of mvr, tee was recommended. on the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head. no change in ms. in the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat ct of the head done which was negative for bleeds. on 7/25/91, patient went down for a tee but desated to 80s and the

tee will be performed while patient is intubated. patient is currently npo ready for cath this pm.pmh:1.	copd- pfts on 7/17/91 w/ fev1=32%, fev1/fvc=63%2.	mvr- st. jude's valve, 20853.	hocm- s/p

including hocm, s/p mvr and myomectomy as well as copd who presents with increasing sob and doe for the past four days.  of note, the patient notes increasing doe for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.  her progressive doe may be related to chf, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on ekg however, her acute decompensation may be related to copd exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.plan: sob- unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial--treat copd w/ atrovent nebs, prednisone, o2, levaquin--patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so albuterol was dc'ed--follow urine output secondary to iv lasix--daily weights, strict is and os--keep o2 sats 88-90% ekg changes- pt w/o known history of cad however w/ and st depressions on ekg that appear rate related--iv lopressor to decrease rate--asa--cardiac monitor--cardiac cath per dr. janssen with teemvr- on coumadin--follow inrtrigeminal neuralgia- improving w/ pain control and tegretol--continue current managementfen- --encourage pos--replete lytes as needed6.    prophylaxis- nexium, coumadin_________________________________henry norton, mdpager #45074
