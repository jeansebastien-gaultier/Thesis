he was given a dose of iv lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.  he was then brought to the wmc ed where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.  an abg on bipap showed 7.35/53/100.  his blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.  he was given approximately 2l of ns with resultant cvp of 11.  he was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.  he was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.  he was then transferred to the internal medicine.review of systems: per hpi;

his chest x-ray is consistent with a rul and rml pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.  his presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.sepsis: continue egdt, with goal map>65 and goal cvp of 8-12a. ivf with ns for goal cvp 8-12b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal map>65 (currently off pressors)c. monitor urine outputd. measure central venous oxygen saturatione. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow amf.  f/u all culture datag. continue advair 250/50h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in edi.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotensionarf: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydrationppx: ranitidine and heparin _______________________________noah g. rosariopager 81251pgy-1
