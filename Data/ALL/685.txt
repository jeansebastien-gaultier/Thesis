[known lastname ] is a 29-year-old man with severe hypertension. hehas undergone work-up by his primary care doctor, a renalphysician and cardiology, without known cause. hypertensionappears to be familial, present in his father and sister, bothfrom a young age. it is possible that whatever underlyingpredisposition he has is inherited in an autosomally dominantfashion, although this cannot be concluded given our limitedknowledge of his pedigree. further outpatient work-up seemswarranted.there was no underlying vascular malformation or other lesionfrom which this hemorrhage has arisen, at least at theresolution of ct. his compliance has been good but imperfect, sowe think that his hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive duringthe exertions of sexual activity. as such, a primary goal hasbeen to control his blood pressure, which is now quite adequate.the hemorrhage was in the basis pontis on the left, withapparent vasogenic edema of the overlying tegmentum. althoughthere is not frank hemorrhage into the midline pontinetegmentum, edema and mass effect in this area most likelyaccounts for drowsiness. he initially demonstrated troemner'sand babinksi's signs on the left, suggesting some mass effect tothe right basis pontis, but this is now resolved. eye movementabnormality is partially explained by lesion of the tract of thesixth nucleus, with nuclear sparing. in addition, adbuction tothe right is incomplete and the reason for this is onlyspeculative. he demonstrates loss of voluntary cough andswallow, with preservation of brisk involuntary cough, likelydue to the effect of the lesion on the dorsal midline portion ofbasis pontis, with preserved nucleus ambiguus and lateralmedulla.drowsiness resulted in intubation while at the scanner afterarrival at the ed. he was extubated successfully on [2105-4-28], withsome difficult managing secretion, but not oxygenation.when extubated and with controlled pressure he was transferredto the neurology step-down unit. atenolol was stopped andreplaced with metoprolol tartrate given better 24 hour coverageand conversion to the succinate salt is intended at discharge.after peg placement he had desaturations to the low 80s and wassent back to the icu. his cxr showed low lung volumes and theetiology was thought to be from the abdominal binder andrestrictive lung disease. he was able to be weaned to trach maskwith low o2 requirements and sent back to the floor. his bloodpressure was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge in the120s-130s systolic.he will follow up in clinic with dr.
