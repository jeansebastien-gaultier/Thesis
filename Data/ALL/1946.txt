congestive heart failure.secondary diagnoses:1. coronary artery disease.2. diabetes mellitus.3. hypertension.history of present illness: the patient is a 66-year-old womanwith coronary artery disease andcardiomyopathy admitted with clinical shortness of breath. thepatient has a long history of coronary artery disease with mostrecent echocardiogram in 8/06 showing dilated left ventricle ,ejection fraction of 30% to 35% , inferior posterior thinning andakinesis and severe hypokinesis of the distal septum to apex.there was remaining wall of hypokinesis. there was also traceaortic insufficiency and hypertrophied right ventricle. the mostrecent catheterization was 11/4/99 showing a left main with 30%distal stenosis , occluded left anterior descending , right coronaryartery with 40% proximal and mid 70% stenoses. the grafts werewithout significant disease. the left heart catheterization showedleft ventricle pressures of 220/80. left ventriculography revealedan ejection fraction of 50% to 55% with trace mitral regurgitation.( please refer to past medical history for further details of thepatient's cardiac history ). the patient now reports malaise forone week with increasing dyspnea on exertion. she also reportsfever to 101 two days ago with cough productive of white sputum.she reports that she went to urgent care and received bactrim. shealso had received bactrim 48 hours ago. she also complains ofincreased orthopnea , baseline two-pillow orthopnea and nowfive-pillow orthopnea and nighttime cough. she denies dietaryindiscretion or medical noncompliance and reports that herperipheral edema is stable. she denies dysuria or frequency andalso believes that her weight has increased although notes on chartindicate that her baseline is 220 to 228 pounds.past medical history: coronary artery disease , cardiac riskfactors were age and hypertension. diabetesmellitus , nonproliferative anemia , one non-q wave myocardialinfarction in 1981 , coronary artery bypass grafting in 1995 atbarreman a health with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending graft , saphenous vein graft to posteriordescending artery graft , saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginalgraft. several admissions for congestive heart failure includingone in 1996 which included an echocardiogram with ejection fractionof 40%. decreased from earlier 59% with inferior posteriorhypokinesis. congestive heart failure admission in 2/11 with anechocardiogram that showed ejection fraction of 30% to 35% ,decreased from previous echocardiogram. non-q wave myocardialinfarction in 8/06 at i imin medical center with troponin of6. baseline left bundle branch block. insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus. status post right carotid endarterectomy.hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , status post appendectomy ,status post right mastoidectomy ( secondary to recurrent otitis ).history of recurrent transient ischemic attacks. amaurosis fugaxin left eye. the patient was treated with coumadin after 2/14admission. head ct showed no sign of infarct. echocardiogram wasnegative for pfo. ejection fraction at the time was 60%.loculated pleural effusion in 4/9 with apparent decortication andlysis. nephrolithiasis but none times greater than two years.bell's palsy resolved.allergies: penicillin causes hives. ceclor causes a rash.medications: digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , ec-asa 81 mg p.o. q.d. ,plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. q.d. ,cozaar 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. , zestril 20mg p.o. b.i.d. , zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d. , hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nph 50 q.a.m. , 8 q.p.m. subcutaneously ,slow-k eight once a day.social history: retired housewife , married , rare alcohol use , notobacco use.family history: notable for mother with myocardial infarction atage 40 and a father with myocardial infarction atage 40.physical examination: vital signs: temperature 98.1 , pulse 59 ,blood pressure 180/82 , respirations 22 , and96% on room air. weight 226 pounds. general: large woman lyingin bed in no acute distress. heent: jugulovenous pressure greaterthan 12 cm , oropharynx clear , no thyromegaly. chest: bibasilarcrackles and diffuse wheezes and rhonchi , no e to a changes.cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm. there was a ii/visystolic murmur loudest at bases , question s4 , s1 and s2. abdomen:soft , protuberant , nontender , benign. extremities: bilateraledema to knees , minimally pitting. neurologic: cranial nerves andstrength intact.laboratory/x-ray studies: notable for bun of 55 ( baseline high 20sin 8/06 ) , creatinine of 1.7 , baselineof 1.0 to 1.2. hematocrit of 35.5 with mcv of 80.hospital course: the patient was admitted with presumptivediagnosis of recent tracheal bronchitiscomplicated by overlying congestive heart failure. she was treatedwith doxycycline and never spiked a fever in-house. her cough wasessentially nonproductive and thus sputum was not sent. she wasdiuresed progressively and responded well symptomatically to thisdiuresis. her pulmonary examination improved. the patient'sexamination was complicated by some asymptomatic bradycardia intothe 40s , particularly at night while lying down. on admission , herdigoxin level was low at 0.5. an attempt to increase her betablocker appeared to exacerbate this bradycardia and thus she wasdischarged on the same dose that she was admitted with , i.e. ,lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. notably , even when these medicationswere held , her pulse was often in the high 40s or low 50s withoutsymptoms and remained less than 60 even while walking some of thetime. her thyroid stimulating hormone was measured and was normalat 3.13. the patient's elevated bun and creatinine were thoughtsecondary to her congestive heart failure and in fact , hercreatinine decreased with diuresis. recent iron studies in 2/30were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease and her hematocrit of35 on review was towards the low end of normal range during thepast year.disposition: the patient was discharged to home in stablecondition. discharge medications were ec-asa 325 mgp.o. q.d. , clonidine 0.1 mg p.o. b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.q.d. , doxycycline 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days , nph insulin 8units q.a.m. , start 50 units q.a.m. and 8 units q.p.m. , zestril 20mg p.o. b.i.d. , hytrin 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. , zocor 20 mg p.o. q.p.m. ,imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. , demadex 100 mg p.o. q.d. , cozaar 50 mg

athome. they will also check the patient's potassium and creatinineand call in abnormal results to dr. tribley .dictated by: leo doak , m.d. bt08attending: leonardo e. lemkau , m.d. zv97
