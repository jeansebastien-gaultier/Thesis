oncology service andevaluated by the ortho spine team. he was transferred to the[hospital1 18] spine surgery service and taken to the operating room forthe above procedure without complication. for details pleaserefer to the dictated operative note. teds / pneumoboots wereused for postoperative dvt prophylaxis. intravenous antibioticswere continued for 24hrs postoperatively per standard protocol.the patient's pain was controlled with iv pain medicationsfollowed by oral analgesics once tolerating pos. the patient'sdiet was advanced as tolerated. the foley was removed on pod2.physical therapy was consulted for mobilization..on pod2 the patient was noted to have hypotension to sbps 90'sassociated with tachycardia to 110's and hypoxia 90's on ra anda low grade fever.  at ct chest was negative for pe.  he wastransferred to the icu for closer monitoring given hismetastatic ca history and started on empiric iv antibiotics.  hewas stable in the icu and improved with ivf and transferred outto the floor..on the floor, the pt was persistently febrile, although hisfever curve was trending downwards by abx day 6. the plan was tocontinue an 8 day empiric course of vanc/ceftazidime, althoughcx were all negative and even ct torso failed to reveal asource. pain control became an issue, particularly left shoulderpain. pt is known to have metastatic disease. he required enoughshort-acting pain morphine to warrant starting ms contin, whichwas uptitrated. however, pt became more somnolent, but stillcomplained of pain when he was awoke. he had episodes ofhypotension to the 80s requiring boluses. he ultimately wasgiven narcan for his somnolence. he woke immediately, but beganto complain of chest tightness. he was suctioned deeply forsuspected mucous plug, but was intermittently desaturating, evenon 6l nc. he was transferred to the micu, where he was intubatedimmediately as was unresponsive and unable to protect hisairway..=====================[hospital unit name 13533] [date range (1) 26511]=====================.# acute hypoxic respiratory failure: initial abg revealedsignificant hypercapnia in setting of narcotics and alteredmental status, so hypoxic respiratory failure was initiallyattributed to hypoventilation. as stated above, he wasimmediately intubated upon arrival to the [hospital unit name 153] and continued onbroad antibiotics. he remained on mechanical ventilation. it wasthen noticed that his endotracheal tube appeared high. onbronchoscopy a new necrotic obstructing mass was noticed in hisairway causing tracheal deviation. it was unlikely to beprocedure-related trauma, given appearance of the obstruction.most likely the patient experienced an acute bleed of a necrotictumor, which compressed his airway and led to inability toprovide adequate mechanical ventilation. this ultimately led tohis expiration..# hypotension: on the evening of arrival to the [hospital unit name 153] the patientbegan to experience labile blood pressures, dropping to the 80ssystolic while sleeping and climbing to the 140s systolic whenawakened. he was given two 1l ns fluid boluses without change inhis hemodynamics. transient hypotension was initially attributedto the use of propofol for sedation (subsequently changed tofentanyl/midazolam) and perhaps large amounts of pain medicationthat were slow to clear secondary to impaired liver and renalfunction. he was started on peripheral dopamine for pressuresupport..# acute kidney injury: thought likely secondary to contrastnephropathy based on timing and urine electrolytes. he continuedto have adequate urine output and his creatinine trended down..# metastatic adenocarcinoma: suspected lung primary and knownbony and liver mets. the patient had undergone 6 cycles oftaxol/carboplatin. he also underwent a t5-8 laminectomy forsuspected cord compression secondary to a spinal met on [4-29]. hesuffered tremendous pain from his extensive disease, which wascontrolled with fentanyl boluses in the [hospital unit name 153]..# coronary artery disease: ekgs obtained were consistent withprior and showed no evidence of acute ischemia. he was ruled outfor myocardial infarction with two negative sets of cardiacbiomarkers..# diabetes mellitus: on oral anti-hyperglycemics at home, whichwere held. fingersticks were checked q6h and insulin provided asneeded..# anemia: likely secondary to chronic inflammation fromunderlying malignancy. hct remained stable.medications on admission:betimol 0.5 % eye drops one drop in each eye dailyxalatan
