to pass the scope to the second part of the duodenum dueto obstruction, most likely extrinsic compression from coloncancer metastases. a duodenal stent ( 9cm x22mm wallflex enteralduodenal stent) was

hypertension who is being admitted to the [hospital unit name 153] due tohypotension and need for continued intubation s/p ercp attemptfor biliary obstruction..# hypotension: patient became hypotensive after intubation onpropofol. likely secondary to propofol, however also in thedifferential is hypotension from sepsis. he has two potentialsources for sepsis: biliary obstruction and recent apsiration.also could have volume depletion. since coming to the floor hispressures had recovered and phenylephrine weaned off. given thepossibility of sepsis, he was started on vancomycin, flagyl andcefepime, but then changed to ceftriaxone and flagyl.  thevancomycin was discontinued after the cultures were negative x48 horus.  on the day before discharge he was transitioned to polevofloxacin to complete a full course through [11-11], cultures nogrowth to date at discharge..# biliary obstruction/obstructive jaundice: the patientunderwent a ct at the osh which showed intrahepatic andextrahepatic bile duct dilatation likely due to a metastasis tothe pancreatic head from his colon cancer. he failed ercp due toexternal compression of the duodenum limiting their ability topass the scope.  a duodenal stent was placed by the ercp team tohelp to decompress the gastric outlet obstruction.  given thefailed ercp attempt, ir was consulted and performed an ir guidedbiliary drain on [2199-11-6].  he was transferred to the floor andhis lfts trended down after the stent was placed.  his drain wasclamped on [11-8] and with continued improvement of his livertests and symptoms.  he was discharged with a clamped biliarydrain to follow up with interventional radiology.  if symptomsreturn, the drain can be unclamped to a bag..# respiratory distress: the patient presented to the icuintubated since the ercp. on the following morning he wassuccessfully extubated and breathing appropriately on room air..# anemia, chronic disease: the patient was noted to havecoffe-ground regurgitation during the ercp procdure. he wasanemic with a hct of 26 at the osh and 25 on admission labshere. vit b12 and folate normal at the osh. fe low, but other festudies not sent. haptoglobin high makes hemolysis unlikely.most likely due to anemia of chronic disease and possibly due tooncologic treatment. started an iv ppi due to concern for coffeeground regurgitant.  his
