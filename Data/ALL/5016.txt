127-319-4834contact:  	daughter: penelope yandell 761-259-5716code status: 	fullsource:		cc:  syncopehpi: ms. yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive pmh including htn, sz d/o vs tias, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and dvts who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.per a note from her neurologist, dr. gary keyes, ms. yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. she had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. she was started on depakote for this. between march and april of 2102 her depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. eeg in january 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.   in july 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. dr. keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.  ms. yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.  when she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.  these episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.  ms. yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.  she does not recall the events herself.  the family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).  the family reports that ems checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.in the emergency department, ms. yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2l.  she received zofran for nausea, asa, and ivf, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. the patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.  do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.  the episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.  she denies fevers/chills.  no chest pain, palpitations.  some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.  has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.  she takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.  past medical history:1. hypertension2. history of supraventricular tachycardia3. dyslipidemia4. chronic dyspnea5. inappropriate sinus tachycardia 6. seizure

with radiation therapy effect in right lung     apex. prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of     tiny lung nodules seen.mri 9/02     findings:  diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute     ischemia.  there is susceptibility artifact in the region of the     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr     hole or craniotomy.  there are chronic appearing, small right     cerebellar infarcts.  there are scattered periventricular flair     and t2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent     with small vessel ischemic change.  there is flair hyperintensity     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral     parietal and left occipital lobes.  no abnormal enhancement is     seen.  the brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise     unremarkable.  the major intracranial flow voids are normal.     there is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.  there is     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  there are     bilateral lens implants.  the bones, soft tissues and orbits are     otherwise unremarkable.     mra:  there is signal dropout in the p2 segment of the right     posterior cerbral artery.  there is diffuse irregularity of the     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.  there is moderate     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.  the     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.  there is     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of     the circle of willis.     impression:     flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior     predominance as described.  this could represent hemorrhage, high     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium     injection.     signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.  diffuse irregularity     of the left posterior cerebral artery.  these findings could be     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but     vasculitis is another possibility.     moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.     no acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.     chronic right cerebellar infarction.     small vessel ischemic changes.carotid us 3/02impressions:1. right proximal cca stenosis.2. minimal disease of the right carotid artery bifurcation.3. minimal disease of the left carotid artery bifurcation.4. bilateral antegrade vertebral artery flow.echo    011.  normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.  left ventricular    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.  there is no flattening of the    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary    arterial pressure.  there is a reduced mitral valve diastolic doppler e/a    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.2.  there is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.    there are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may    represent atherosclerotic change. 3.  the aortic valve is trileaflet.  cannot fully exclude the possibility of    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.  there is no evident aortic stenosis    or aortic insufficiency.  very mild mitral annular fibrosis.  otherwise,    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.  normal appearing tricuspid    and pulmonary leaflets.  there are signals of trace mitral regurgitation    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  flow velocity could not be optimally    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.4.  there is no evident pericardial effusion. assessment & plan:1)  syncope : unclear etiology.
