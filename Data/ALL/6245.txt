tubehistory of present illness:the pt is a 50 year-old right-handed man with a recenthistory of hsv encephalitis who presents with worsening speechdifficulties and decreased movement of the right arm.  he wasinitially diagnosed with hsv 1 meningitis on [2190-4-23].  hepresented after he was in an accident while driving from ri tovt, rented a second car, and was in a second accident, at whichpoint he was brought to an outside hospital and eventuallydiagnosed with hsv meningitis.  he was started on a course of ivacyclovir, and discharged to [hospital 38] rehab.  his rehab coursewas complicated by a lower extremity dvt, for which he wasstarted on coumadin, however on [5-15] there was concern that theclot was mobile, and on [2190-5-16] he had an ivc filter placed.around this time he became febrile to 102.6, and on [5-18] wastransferred to [hospital1 18] for fever and worsening confusion.  he wasadmitted from [date range (1) 66375], during which time he underwent a repeatlp, which showed 56 wbcs and a protein of 83, but was hsvnegative.  he had blood and urine cultures that were alsonegative.  his fevers resolved with restarting acyclovir, thoughhis mental status continued to fluctuate, and he was sent backtorehab on [5-21].  his sister continued to visit him, and reportsthat even as recently as two days ago he was actually startingtoimprove.  at his best he was reported to be communicative, withaslightly strange affect, and mild short term memory andexecutivefunction impairment.  however, on [5-26] he was noted to be veryunsteady with pt, and was found to be orthostatic as low of sbpof 60 when standing, and it was recommended that he start bothfludrocortisone and midodrine.  on [5-27] the patient was noted tobe forcibly keeping his right eye closed, and also was felt tobemore apraxic with worsening coordination.  he was also felt tonot be moving his right arm as frequently.  for all of this hewas transferred to [hospital1 18] for further evaluation.past medical history:- lyme disease, per sister s/p treatment years ago- malaria, per sister s/p treatment years ago- lumbar laminectomysocial history:divorced, has a girlfriend. previously

electrographic and clinicalimprovement. he was increased on his keppra from 500 mg [hospital1 ] to1500 mg [hospital1 ]. he continued to have frequent r temporalcomplex partial seizures, characterized by focal rhythmic thetaactivity.  clinically, the seizures were characterized by l handtwitching movements, r facial twitching, and confusion.on [5-29], he was loaded on phosphenytoin and started onmaintenancedosing with improvement in seizure frequency.  on [6-1], he wasloaded on vimpat 200 mg iv, and started on maintenance of 100 mg[hospital1 ].patient had a very complicated course with many antiepilepticmedications trialed.he was initially transferred to the icu for hypotension andrespiratory distress.his seizures were controlled with midazolam, then he wasswitched to propofol because midazolam was not providingsufficient sedation, and this was also effective in suppressingseizures. he then began having frequent nonconvulsive seizures,and was started on phenobarbital [6-6], and depakote on [6-9]. heunderwent trach and peg [6-11]. zonisamide and topamax were alsotried. he temporarily was able to be transferred to theneurology step down unit, but returned to the icu for midazolamdrip on [2190-7-4].nonconvulsive status epilepticus remained refractory.  theseizures continued to originate from bilateral temporal lobesdespite increasing serum levels of dilantin (corrected 20-25)and phenobarbital (90-100) and midazolam drip.hsv encephalitis:patient had severe hsv encephalitis resulting in necrosis andcystic changes in bilateral temporal lobes. serial mris alsoshowed development of extensive vasogenic edema in bilateralcortices. there was concern for adem process, and patient wastreated with 5 days high dose steroids. repeat mri did showimprovement in the diffuse edema after steroids. another repeatmri done several days after stopping steroids appeared stablewith no further improvement but no worsening. it was impossibleto determine if the steroids would have improved his mentalstatus, this the timing coincided with worsening of his seizuresand starting midazolam drip. on [2190-7-21], a family meetingwas held with the epilepsy team, palliative care, and the sicuteam. it was decided that the patient would not want to go onwith his current quality of life. it was then decided to makethe patient comfort-measures-only with continuation of theantiepileptics and to pursue extubation on friday [7-23]. thepatient maintained off of intubation for several hours butultimately passed away friday night.id:1. hsv encephalitis- id was consulted on admission. patient hascompleted 2 21 day courses of acyclovir. repeat csf hsv pcr wasnegative x 2. he underwent thorough workup for other coexistingviral infections which was negative (hiv, cmv, ebv, vzv, htlv1,[male first name (un) 2326] virus). hiv viral load was also negative, so patient couldnot possibly be in the "window period" of acute infection. hsvculture was also negative from the csf, so there was no evidencethat the type of hsv was resistant to acyclovir, and thus noadditional antiviral treatment was warranted. brain biopsy wasdiscussed several times throughout his course, but ultimatelydecided that there would be no diagnostic or therapeuticadvantage from this.2. fever of unknown origin-patient developed fever to 102 daily. he was initially treatedwith empiric course of vanco/zosyn but fevers persisted with noclear source and all cultures negative. id ultimately thoughtthis was either drug or central fever. he did also develop amild maculopapular rash and elevated eosinophil count, whichpoint toward drug fever. his seizure medications were likelyculprit, but could not be stopped due to nonconvulsive status.the rash improved on its own and the fevers continued untildischarge.3. lymphopenia/low cd4 countpatient developed lymphopenia and low cd 4 count (212 on [7-5]).this caused concern for hiv, but hiv antibodies and viral loadwere negative. other possible causes such as cmv and htlv1 werealso negative. this may be due to chronic illness and bonemarrow suppression from hsv infection.4. utiurine culture from [7-9] grew >100,000 e coli, treated withceftriaxone.5. pnasputum culture from [7-9] grew klebsiella, treated withceftriaxone.gi:tranaminitis- patient had normal lfts on admission but developedelevation in ast/alt to 300-400 with no elevated bilirubin butwith elevated ammonia. this was likely a medication side effect,and improved with stopping depakote.there was then a second episode of lft elevation that resolvedwith stopping zonisamide.heme:1. dvt- his prior rehab course was complicated by a lower extremity dvtand he was started on coumadin. however, on [5-15] there wasconcern that the clot was mobile, and on [2190-5-16] he had an ivcfilter placed. he was treated with therapeutic doses of lovenoxduring this hospitalization, since coumadin was interacting withaeds.2. anemiahematocrit gradually trended down during admission from 33 atadmission to 25. hematology was consulted. there was no evidenceof hemolysis or any other acute concerning process on peripheralsmear. iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency so hewas started on ferrous sulfate daily. there was also likelycontribution of bone marrow suppression from medications.renal:acute kidney injury- likely due to acyclovir and hypotension onsedation and aeds. resolved.medications on admission:- colace 100mg [hospital1 ]- finasteride 5mg daily- fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily- keppra 500mg [hospital1 ]- midodrine 5mg daily- mirtazapine 15mg
