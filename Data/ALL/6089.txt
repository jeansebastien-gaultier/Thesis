endomysial antibodies-pndbrief hospital course:1. micu course ([date range (1) 12258]): pt had an lp and the results ofthe csf analysis were unremarkable. her mental status improvedin icu and she became much more alert and was oriented by themorning of the second hospital day. while in the icu, thechronic pain service was consulted. their recommendations arenoted below.2. altered mental status: as above, the pt. underwent a lumbarpuncture, the results of which were not suggestive of cnsinfection as the cause of her encephalopathy.  a tsh, b12 andelectrolytes were sent which were all within normal limits. anrpr was sent and was nonreactive. upon further discussion withthe pt. when she became more alert, it was discovered that aftertaking the first two doses of ciprofloxacin the week prior toadmission, the pt. became extremely nauseous and had episodes ofemesis and diarrhea.  this led the pt. to stop taking hernarcotics which she is on chronically for pain.  thus, it wasbelieved that the pt's. altered mental status was secondary tonarcotics withdrawal.  it should be noted, however, thatciprofloxacin has been associated with acute psychosis,seizures, and acute delirium.3. chronic pain: the pt. reported that she had been on largedoses of oxycontin, valium and neurontin for pain in her rightshoulder, back and legs prior to admission.  in the context ofher heavy narcotics use, a chronic pain service consult wasobtained while the pt. was in the intensive care unit.  theyrecommended stopping oxycontin and decreasing the dose ofvalium.  in addition, they recommended continuing neurontin andadding methadone.  the pt. initially tolerated this regimenwell.  however, on the fourth hospital day, the pt. continued tocomplain of leg spasms.  baclofen was introduced with somesuccess in relieving her spasms.the pain service also recommended that the pt. be started oncelecoxib for musculoskeletal pain but this was held over theconcern of possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding in thesetting of iron deficiency anemia of yet uncertain etiology.4. iron deficiency anemia:  the pt. was found to have profoundiron deficiency anemia on admission.  further discussion withthe pt. and her pcp revealed that the pt. has known irondeficiency and has received supplementation in the past.  agastroenterology consult was called.  they had recommendedperforming both colonoscopy to examine for occult malignancy(especially in the face of recent unintentional weight loss andcachexia) and an egd to evaluate the anatomy of her upper gitract in light of her prior gastric bypass.  the pt. did notdesire to undergo these procedures during this inpatienthospitalization, but agreed to follow-up for these studies on anoutpatient basis.  the importance of following-up regarding thisissue was explicitly stressed to the pt. prior to discharge.she was discharged on 325mg of ferrous sulfate once per day.5. weight loss/cachexia/?malabsorption:  in light of the pt's.~20 pounds over the 6 to 8 weeks prior to admission, a nutritionconsult was obtained.  they had recommended tpn in addition toencouraging the pt. to increase her p.o. intake.  the pt. didreceived three days of tpn through a picc line in addition to aregular diet.  there was, again, concern over occult malignancywhich further prompted the desire to perform a colonoscopy.  abreast exam was also performed as a part of a malignancy work-upand was unremarkable.  the pt. stated that she has had a"negative" mammography within the last year.the gastroenterology service also raised the possibility ofceliac disease and ttg-iga and endomysial antibodies were sentand were pending at the time of discharge.there is also the possibility that her weight loss is secondaryto her profound depression with vegetative symptoms.6. depression: the pt. admitted to severe depression in themonths prior to admission.  as such, the psychiatry service wasconsulted.  they recommended re-starting fluoxetine which wasdone at a dose of 20mg per day.7. osteoporosis: the pt. was started on calcium and vitamin dsupplementation.8. migraine headaches: the pt. complained of headache suggestiveof typical (not classical) migraine.  her pain was not relievedwith acetaminophen.  a trial of subcutaneous sumatriptan,however, did provide relief.  she was discharged with aprescription for subcutaneous sumatriptan with instructions tostop taking the medication if she experienced flushing,dizziness, fatigue (suggestive of serotonin syndrome due toconcomitant use of fluoxetine).medications on admission:[doctor first name ] 180 mg po dailypremarin 1.25 mg po dailymaxair prnoxycontin 160 mg po 8x/dailyneurontin 600 mg po dailypercocet 325-650 mg po q4-6hours prn
