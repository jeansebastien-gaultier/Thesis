record date: 2080-07-28  july 28, 2080   dr. keys   re:fair, billmr#:220-41-86-4 dear dr. keys: dr. oates and i saw bill fair today with regard to his troublesome right knee.  as you are aware he is a 56 year old man who is a convenience store manager.  he has had a lot of trouble with his right knee over the years, mainly related to sports injuries. he has had in particular 2 years of pain now in his right knee.  it got so bad 6 months ago that he required large amounts of ibuprofen to relieve that.  it has slowly got better since then.   at present his main problem is pain in the knee which mainly occurs with activity but he also has rest and night pain.  he has a restricted walking distance. with regard to function, he is able to carry out his work with difficulty and requires periods of rest in the evening on returning home from work.  he has noticed his knee is becoming slowly more bowed.   with regard to treatment he has is taking regular analgesia in the form of tylenol but has recently noticed blood in his stool for which he is going to have a colonoscopy in the near future.   he has not tried any canes and has not had any physical therapy as yet. on examination i note he has bilateral varus knees, worse on the right than the left.  he has an antalgic gait and marked varus thrust.   he has a marked effusion that does not have any gross swelling indicative of arthritis.  he has a 5 degree fixed flexion deformity and flexes up to 115 degrees.  his varus deformity is not fully correctable.  he has grade 5 quadriceps power.   x-rays reveal marked degenerative changes in his right knee with complete obliteration of joint space on the right side.   i note he also has changes in his left knee indicative of medial compartment arthritis but his left knee is currently asymptomatic.   we have discussed the operative options for him which consist of high tibial osteotomy, a unicompartmental knee replacement, and a total knee replacement.  at present neither he not dr. oates feels that his symptoms are severe enough to warrant operative intervention.  we would certainly reconsider should he run into trouble in the next few months aspirating his knee, instilling some corticosteroids.  we have advised him that this will only provide him with short term relief but may allow him enough relief to begin some walking and fitness in an attempt to lose some weight. we have organized to see him again in 4-6 month's time at which stage we will reassess him.  should he run into trouble in the meantime he cal certainly ring up and make an appointment to come and see us and we will aspirate the knee and instill some corticosteroid.   with kind regards.   yours sincerely,     _______________________________oliver m. oates, m.d. dd: 07/28/80dt: 07/31/80dv: 07/28/80  dictated by xavier embry, m.d. for oliver m. oates, m.d. /omo/vaughtrjdkyfbv        not reviewed by attending physician
