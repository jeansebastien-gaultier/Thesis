edema is likely multifactorial.  she does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.  i reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.  she may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.  her leg swelling may also relate to her norvasc use.  i did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.  significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.  the patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.  i recommended initially that she stop the norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.  i discussed the use and side effects of this medication.  i will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.2.  low back pain. i recommend the patient continue her bextra.  we discussed other pain medications including narcotics.  we elected against using these medications today.3.  history of sleep apnea.  the patient has significant fatigue.  this may be due to her sleep apnea.  in addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.  i discussed this with her today.  i would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.  she did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.  she will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.______________________________roger york, m.d.dictated by: roger yorkescription document:4-6557064 dana vaughndd:
