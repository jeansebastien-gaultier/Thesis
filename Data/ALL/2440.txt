[initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) ]-gastric lavage was negative. initallythe patient was hypotensive with sbp in the 80s. the patient wasgiven fluids and was transfused 2u of ffp and 2u of prbc. onlypoor peripheral access was obtained (20g in foot) and thereforea cvl was attempted. an attempt for a r femoral line wasunsuccessful. a rij attempt was unsuccessful as the wire wastraveling in the head. when trying to place a l subclavian line,the physician in the osh was unable to withdraw the wire. a cxrrevealed the cvl wire coiled in the ivc filter. the patient istransfered for ir intervention to withdraw the wire..on arrival to the [hospital1 18], the patient denied any cp, sob,abdominal pain, back pain. she denied any brbpr prior to thisepisode. she states that the brbpr started last two days. thepatient denies ever having had any colonoscopy before. shedenies any lh or dizziness. the patient is s/p recent thr thatwas complicated by a dvt. the pt had an ivc filter placed andwas on heparin sc tid for dvt prophylaxis.past medical history:pmh:rheumatoid arthritis -
