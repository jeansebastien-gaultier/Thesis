[known lastname 59777] is a 44 year old female with a history of recentlydiagnosed stage iv non-small cell lung cancer metastatic tobrain, adrenals, and kidneys who presents with complaints ofblood when she urinates. she notes that she first noticed thistwo days ago. she also notes pain with urination since shenoticed the blood. she ntes it has been the worst between 1 amand 5 am where she can't leave the br due to constant need tourinate. she also urinates several times during the day.  eachtime is extremely painful. she notes that since the bleedingbegan, the pain has begun to improve but the bleeding hascontinued at the same frequency.  she denies any vaginalbleeding, melena, hematochezia, or hematemesis.in the [hospital1 18] ed, 98.3, 108/70, 96, 18, 100% ra.  while in the edshe was

[2184-2-15].# history of subluxation of the metaphalangeal joint in[2178-6-17].# prior history of obesity.past oncologic history:initially presented in [2-/2184] with complaints of weight loss,nausea and vomiting.  it seems that her symptoms were initiallymild.  she did not have shortness of breath, cough or othercomplaints at that time.  by [3-/2184], she continued to loseweight and was found to have a potential right-sided dentalabscess.  she was treated for that empirically with antibioticsand continued to have weight loss, diarrhea.  it seems that inthe end of [month (only) 958] and beginning of [5-/2184], the patientrepresented to medical attention with mild shortness ofbreath with exertion and chest discomfort.  she also had notedat that point subjective low-grade temperatures and some coughproductive of brown sputum.  in [5-/2184], she already had a20-pound weight loss.  during the initial presentation, she alsocomplained of one episode of hemoptysis with production of morethan one teaspoon of blood. due to the above-mentioned symptoms,the patient underwent a computer tomography of the chest on[2184-5-14] that disclosed a 2.6 cm cavitary lesion in theposterior right upper lobe with additional smaller right-sidedpulmonary nodules and extensive right hilar lymphadenopathy withmarked narrowing of the hilar airways and vessels. at thatpoint, further staging imaging was obtained with a computertomography of the torso on [2184-5-29] that disclosed the chestfindings as detailed above.  there was also right upper lobepulmonary interstitial thickening, which was worrisome forlymphangitic spread.  there was a subtle sclerosis of the t4vertebral body.  there was no evidence of extrathoracic disease. the adrenals had 2 cm masses.  there were multiple enlargedretroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm. an mri ofhead was performed on [2184-5-29] and showed multiple areas ofenhancement identifying with surrounding edema in both cerebralhemispheres as well as in the posterior fossa.  the largestlesion measured 1.5 cm in the left frontal lobe. the patient hadhad some intermittent headaches that were thought to bemigraines at that point.  however, she had no problems withmotor strength up to the time of initial mri when she developedsome gait instability and required a cane.  she also complainedof intermittent blurry vision.  she was diagnosed the etiologyof the brain lesions.  a brain biopsy was performed on[2184-5-30].  multiple fragments were obtained.  all showed smallnests of large cell undifferentiated carcinoma throughout brainlesions.  d cells were positive for ck7 and ttf1. due to thepresence of nonsmall cell lung cancer with brain metastasis andedema, the patient was referred to neurooncology and radiationoncology.  whole brain radiation was started on [2184-6-5].  thepatient received 3000 cgy to the brain.  she was also started ondexamethasone.  her last day of radiation was [2184-6-15].  she hasmost recently been on a steroid taper. she is currently in theplanning stages of palliative chemotherapy.social history:lives in [location 1411] with fiance and three children. the

kidney based on bloodseen coming from the l ureter at cystoscopy. the renal failurewas believed to be due to a combination of atn, mets, andcontrast. ultimately she was started on hd. the l kidney wasembolized to prevent further bleeding. she is now hd dependent.her hospitalization has been further complicated by pneumoniaand adrenal insufficiency.ultimately, after a trial of dialysis, the pt opted to be cmo.however, when she did not pass over a weekend, she consideredthis a sign that she could live longer and possbily survivecancer. a family meeting was convened and an accommodation wasachieved wherein we would restart abx and try to relieve her ofher anasarca using either diuretics or ultrafiltration. thatsaid, after failing diuretics and prolonged difficulties withthe dialysis catheter, another meeting was convened. antibioticswere stopped again and the patient was returned to [location 3225] withultrafiltration. during an ultrafiltration treatment, she wentinto respiratory
