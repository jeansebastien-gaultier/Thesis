it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .anti-coagulation was started with warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .the patient 's inr became supratherapeutic and coumadin was held .his coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .his inr continued to flucuate .he was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .his inr will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .his inr goal is 02-24 .2# sob on admission :likely due to chf exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 l during his admission .he had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious ivf hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .it appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .on discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as prn nebs and inh copd meds .3# metabolic alkalosis / hypochloremia :etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .this acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an abg revealed a co2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .the patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .his co2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .all sedating medications were held and serial abgs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .4# pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 ml of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .the right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .repeat cxr showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications5# t2dm :the patient was started on glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .he was monitored with qid fingersticks .his blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .6# hyperlipidemia :the patient was continued on his statin .7# copd :the patient was continued on nebs8# ms changes :the patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .his mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .neurology was also consulted and a head ct showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .an eeg showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .his mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .9# hypothyroidism :the patient was continued on his outpatient dose of levothyroxine .10# ? uti :the patient was started on levofloxacin at newton-wellesley hospital for a question of uti based on u/a positive for wbc .ucx during this hospitalization were negative and levofloxacin was d/c 'd .11# chronic lower back pain :the patient was treated with a lidocaine patch and percocet prn .stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and ms changes .12# wound care :the patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .for the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .for the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel ag rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .these recommendations were followed throughout the admission .13# voiding :pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .case was discussed with neurology .he was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .he is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .until then , his foley should remain in place .14# code :the patient was full code during admission .
