[known lastname ] was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgical serviceon [2138-8-13] with abdominal pain and weakness as described above.his initial labs demonstrated a significant anemia, with ahematocrit of 19.7. further review of his history raised thepossibility of an upper gi bleed, as it was determined he hadbeen taking high doses of nsaids for his abdominal pain, and hadunclear history of melanotic stools and/or blood-tinged emesis.he was initially admitted to the surgical icu, where he wasstabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells. hishematocrit then rose to 23.4, at which time he was transfused anadditional 2 units. his hematocrit then stabilized at 28.2.a ct of his abdomen performed shortly after admission on [2138-8-13]revealed the following:1.  extensive hepatic lesions (presumably hcc) with extensivemesenteric root, porta hepatis lymphadenopathy, and mediastinallymphadenopathy as well as mesenteric/omental implants andpossible pancreatic and mesenteric vein invasion as describedabove.  nonhemorrhagic ascites. no areas of active hemorrhagewithin the mass lesions or along the course of the bowel arepresent.2.  gastroesophageal varices.3.  nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with associatedatelectasis. new bilateral pulmonary nodules concerning formetastases.given the size and distribution of his hepatic lesions, mr.[known lastname ] was determined to be not eligible for surgicalresection. mr. [known lastname ] also received an esophago-gastricendoscopy to evaluate his suspected upper gi bleed, anemia, andabdominal pain. this study revealed the following:- [name prefix (prefixes) ] [last name (prefixes) ] b distal esophagitis, 2 cords of small esophagealvarices without red whale signs left undisturbed, irregular gejwith 2 tongues of salmon like mucosa left undisturbed.- diffuse mild to modorate erythema with deformed antrum andpyloric area. one small 1cm clean based ulcer with surroundingedema and erythema left undisturbed. retroflex view revealed amoderate hiatal hernia, hiatus ~3cm.- duodenitis and one small <1cm superficial clean based ulcer inthe duodenal bulb left undisturbed, normal second portion.- otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum.the etiology of his anemia was determined to be a combination ofhepatic lesions/hcc as well as upper gi bleed, possiblysecondary to nsaid use. after hemodynamic and cardiovascularstabilization with transfusions as above, mr. [known lastname ] wastransferred out of the sicu to the surgical floor. his liverlesions and clinical case was discussed during amulti-disciplinary hepatic tumor conference. it was determinedhe would benefit from biopsy of his lesions, with possiblesystemic therapy to be determined as an outpatient. mr.[known lastname ] future outpatient care was coordinated with thehematology-oncology service, and he was discharged on [8-16], [2137].medications on admission:occasional nsaid use.discharge medications:1. pantoprazole 40 mg po q12hrx pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth q12 hours disp #60tablet refills:22. hydromorphone (dilaudid) 2 mg po q4h:prn painrx hydromorphone [dilaudid] 2 mg [12-9] tablet(s) by mouth q 4-6hours prn disp #40 tablet refills:03. docusate sodium 100 mg po bidrx docusate sodium 100 mg 1 capsule(s) by mouth [hospital1 ] prn disp#60 capsule refills:1discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:extensive liver lesions (presumably recurrent hepatocellularcarcinoma)discharge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:please call dr.[name (ni) 1369] office at [telephone/fax (1) 673] for fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, inability totolerate food, fluids or medications.you will be following up with the oncologist dr [first name4 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) 1852]for possible liver biopsy and treatment discussions.please continue omeprazole 2 of the 20 mg tablets twice a daydue to the stomach and small intestine ulcers that developedmost likely due to the amount of advil (ibuprofen) you weretaking. this prescription has been called into the [company 4916] at[last name (namepattern1) 84701] ([telephone/fax (1) 84702]) in [location (un) 669]. it should be covered byyour insurance. please take 2 of the 20 mg tablets twice a dayand avoid the use of ibuprofen (advil), aspirin or any aspirincontaining products.please see dr [first name4 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) 1852] ([telephone/fax (1) 8770]) as soon as possiblefor further evaluation and treatment options.no driving if taking narcotic pain medication.followup instructions:[first name4 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) 1852] [telephone/fax (1) 8770] oncologist  call for appointment assoon as possibledr.
