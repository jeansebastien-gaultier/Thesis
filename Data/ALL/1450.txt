diagnosis: rule out myocardial infarction.history of present illness: patient is a 59 year old white femalewith a history of coronary arterydisease status post bypass in l988 who presented with atypicalchest pain consistent with unstable angina for rule out myocardialinfarction. patient has multiple risk factors including a historyof inferior myocardial infarction , smoking history , family history ,and age. she does not have diabetes mellitus or increasedcholesterol. in 6/11 , she had an inferior myocardial infarctionand had a catheterization in may of l988 showing 70% left anteriordescending , 50% right circumflex , and l00% right coronary arterylesion with an ejection fraction of 80%. in l988 , she had threevessel coronary artery bypass graft with a lima to her leftanterior descending and saphenous vein graft to her omb2 and rightcoronary artery. the patient also has a history of peptic ulcerdisease diagnosed with melena in 1/7 and had anesophagogastroduodenoscopy showing antral gastritis. in 6/17 , shehad a colonoscopy that showed diverticula and she has a history ofchronic anemia with a hematocrit in the mid to high twenties and anmcv of 68. patient was treated with h2 blockers and iron butstopped secondary to constipation. in 2/10 , the patient againpresented with orthostatic changes and shortness of breath withpain to her arm similar to her previous myocardial infarction pain.her hematocrit at that time was 20.8. she was transfused threeunits of packed red blood cells and given lasix and h2 blockers.she ruled out for myocardial infarction and had a catheterizationin 2/10 that showed patent lima to her left anterior descending ,her left anterior descending native vessel was free of disease , anda 50% long proximal circumflex lesion as well as a proximal om2lesion that was narrowed to 70% at its origin. anesophagogastroduodenoscopy at that time was negative and thepatient was discharged home for colonoscopy with small bowelfollow-through that was never done. in the interval period priorto admission , the patient was in her usual state of fair healthwhen she had an hour of chest pain in the morning and thirtyminutes in the evening per week. she also noted several episodesat rest principally with increased anxiety and with confusion. thepatient presented to gh with a thirty minute history ofsubsternal chest pressure that was not responsive to sublingualnitroglycerin and was associated with diaphoresis and mildshortness of breath. past medical history: significant forcoronary artery disease as described above , peptic ulcer disease asabove , left neck basal carcinoma in l986 , chronic iron deficiencyanemia , history of biliary colic and hiatal hernia , history ofchronic vertigo , and history of a thyroid nodule in the past.physical examination: on admission , her blood pressure was l22/90 ,pulse of 90 , respiratory rate of l6 , andtemperature 98.2. heent: unremarkable. lungs: clear toauscultation. neck: supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.cardiovascular: showed non-displaced point of maximal intensity ,regular rate and rhythm with a positive s4. there were no murmurs ,rubs , or gallops. she had 2+ carotid pulses without bruits.abdomen: showed active bowel sounds and was obese , soft , andnon-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. extremities:showed 2+ femoral , radial , and dorsalis pedis pulses withoutbruits. she had no cyanosis , clubbing , or edema. rectal: showednormal tone without masses and was guaiac negative. neurological:grossly non-focal and within normal limits.laboratory examination: of note , she had a hematocrit of 27.0 witha white count of 6.9 and an mcv of 63.her ekg showed normal sinus rhythm with axis of 20 degrees ,intervals of 0.l6 , 0.08 , and 0.40 with a q wave in iii , and t waveinversions in iii , v3 , and vl-v4. these were all unchanged fromher previous ekg from 5/10hospital course: remarkable only for a rule out myocardialinfarction in which she had serial ck and ekgthat were completely within normal limits. her ck were l54 , 482 ,and 592 with normal mb fractions most consistent with either a verysmall myocardial infarction or , more likely , ck leak from someother source. patient had several episodes of atypical chest painafter being moved down to the floor and ekg were completely withinnormal limits without any evidence of acute changes. patient wastransferred to the floor on july and her significant laboratorydata included a white blood cell count of 5.89 , hematocrit 34 ,platelets 458 , and mcv of 68. calcium was 9.4 , magnesium 2.6 ,sodium l37 , potassium 4.6 , chloride l03 , bicarbonate 22 , bun l8 ,creatinine l.l , and glucose 9l. serial ck were l54 , 482 , 592 , 553 ,464 , and 3l2 , with mb fractions all less than l0. her iron was l4and her tibc was 479 with a ferritin pending. urinalysis showed20-30 white blood cells with 3+ bacteria and a urine culture showedgreater than l00 , 000 e. coli. this was treated with bactrim. onaugust , the patient had no more episodes of chest pain and had anexercise stress test on which he went nine minutes on a modifiedbruce protocol stopping secondary to fatigue. her peak heart ratewas 95 , blood pressure l75/75 without chest pain , and only unifocalpremature ventricular contractions with her exercise. she hadnon-specific st and t wave changes only without evidence forischemia. this was thought to be inconsistent with ongoingischemia and the patient was discharged to home. of note , thepatient is not an akh patient and has no primary doctor.therefore , i am going to assume her care as an out-patient in nida tion hospital .pending laboratory data includes ferritin level.operations and procedures: exercise tolerance test as above andblood products received were none.disposition: discharge medications: 1 ) aspirin , ecasa , 80 mgp.o. q.d. 2 ) bactrim one tablet double-strengthp.o. b.i.d. times seven days. 3 ) sublingual nitroglycerin one q.5minutes with chest pain as directed. 4 ) metoprolol 75 mg p.o.t.i.d. 5 ) iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.i.d. 6 ) pepcid 20 mg p.o.b.i.d. the patient will be followed in my clinic in the nextavailable and i have scheduled her for an upper series with smallbowel follow-through to follow-up on her gastrointestinal bleeding.i started her on iron sulfate and have encouraged her to make surethat she takes this in order to increase her hematocrit.discharge diagnosis: coronary artery disease status post coronaryartery bypass graft , urinary tract infection ,gastrointestinal bleed , and iron deficiencyanemia.tm066/1503drew s. rathfon , m.d. jb8 d: 10/8/91batch: 6830 report: y2903y16 t: 6/0/91dictated by: harley w. raimundo , m.d.[report_end]
