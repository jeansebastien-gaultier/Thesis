presented asa transfer from [hospital6 ] for status epilepticus.she had a gtc yesterday afternoon which was refractory to 5mg ofativan and was subsequently intubated and paralyzed. head ctshowed severe chronic small vessel disease and atrophy but noacute intracranial process. upon transfer she was continuing tohave some intermittent rhythmic movements of the left hand. shewas admitted to the neuro icu for close monitoring.icu and hospital course:#neuro: she was continued on her home dilantin as well as apropofol drip overnight and had no further evidence of seizureactivity. she was maintained on continuous eeg monitoring whichshowed l sided slowing with polymorphic delta compared with rsided theta but no epileptiform activity. she was extubated inthe am of [6-4] and quickly returned to her baseline, able toanswer simple questions appropriately and follow basic commands.dilantin level was 15.4. she received an extra 200mg dilantin on[6-4] and her home dose was increased to 100mgqam/200qpm 5x/wkrather than 4x/wk, with 100mg [hospital1 ] 2x/wk.etiology of her seizure is somewhat unclear at this point.infectious w/u has been negative thus far; it is possible shecould have had an underlying low grade viral uri given herrecent hx of cough. labs unremarkable except for leukocytosiswhich is now downtrending.the patient was transferred to the floor in good condition. thepatient was extubated the day after admission and did well overthe weekend, however on [6-8] the patient spiked a temp and wasfound to have a white count of 19 (see below). she began havingmore seizures that responded acutely to ativan. she wasfrequently somnolent following the seizures - which had a uniquesemiology, including rather purposeful picking at covers anditems real and imagined on her bed, waving her hand in the airas if being attacked by flies, and looking off into the cornerof the room, often up and to the left.she received several boluses of dilantin and her dose wasincreased to 300 mg total daily. a steady level was difficult toobtain and she was switched to infatabs that could be crushedand administered via g-tube. the patient tolerated thistransition well with improved level. her medications andseizures were discussed with her daughter and husband who carefor her, as well as her primary doctor who has been managing herdilantin. plan was made to continue at 300 mg total daily withplans to recheck the level in the week following discharge. thepatient did generally well through the rest of herhospitalization with a single seizure the day prior to dischargefor which she received an extra dose of dilantin with a level upto 14.4 on discharge.# infectious disease: she initially had some low grade feverswith a tmax of 100.3. ua and cxr were unremarkable. bloodcultures were negative. she was continued on her home bactrimfor chronic uti.  on transfer to the floor she became moresomnolent related in part to being post-ictal and also due to anew fever up to 103, as well as an elevated wbc count andinflammatory markers. a cxr revealed bilateral aspirationpneumonias, likely related to her seizures. these were treatedwith empiric antibiotics with significant clinical improvementwithing 36 hours. a picc line was placed and cefepime and vancowere coursed conitnued for 4 more days following discharge (~ 10day course).# fen/gi: she was maintained npo as at baseline does not takeanything by mouth. she received her medications and tube feedsvia her peg.  her temporary peg tube was replaced by ir aas ithad fallen out the week prior and was due to be replaced as anoutpatient. a foley had been placed there temporarily. thepatient tolerated the new tube well.# cardiovascular: she was maintained on telemetry monitoring.she was
