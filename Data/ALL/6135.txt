hyperlipidemia, htn whopresents to the ed intubated by paramedics after they werecalled to his home for increasing sob.  the details of theevents leading up to his intubation are not clear.  indiscussion with friend [name (ni) 73298] [name (ni) ], she reports that [name (ni) 269] came tovisit on [12-19] at which time he was reportedly "doing well" interms of his respiratory status.  sometime after [month/year (2) 269] left,however, pt. called [doctor first name 73298] and told her he needed help as hecould not breathe.  it was at that time that ems was called.there is no ems record in paperwork from the ed, but per verbalreport from ed resident, pt was so sob that he requestedintubation when ems arrived to his home.  although per verbals/o there was report that he never picked up steroids that wereprescribed on discharge, i am unable to find a record ofsteroids having been prescribed during his last admission andfurther upon discharge.  he was intubated at home and wastransferred to [hospital1 18] ed for further evaluation..of note, he was admitted to the surgical service from[date range (1) 21504]/08 after presenting with abdominal pain/rectalbleeding and progressive sob.  he was intubated in emergencyroom d/t increasing respiratory distress despite multiple nebs.ngt tubes was placed with coffee grounds and he reportedly hadepisodes of maroon stool  egd was performed on [12-2] which showedpyloric ulcers, but no e/o active bleeding.  he had subsequentadditional hct drop and egd was repeated on [12-13] showing e/orecently bleeding pyloric ulcer.  ulcer was injected with epiand endoclip was deployed unsuccessfully.  he received a totalof 8 units prbcs, 1 bag platelets, 1 unit ffp last on [12-3]after which his hct remained stable without any furtherbleeding.  he was continued on [hospital1 ] ppi and was treated for h.pylori.  although his respiratory failure was attributed to copdexacerbation, it does not appear that he received steroidsduring his hospital stay.  he was, however, extubatedsuccessfully and when ambulating with pt during last admission,he became sob with o2 sats dipping into the 80% and cta waspositive for subsegmental pe and he was started on heparin gttand transitioned to coumadin prior to discharge..in the ed, initial vs were: t 100.0 p 120 bp 95/77 intubated andbreathing at set rate of 16 o2 sat100%

discharge, intubated athome by paramedics after c/o increasing dyspnea.# respiratory failure likely related to copd exacurbation:history surrounding intubation and presentation is largelyunknown as he does not come with ems paperwork and friend listedas contact is unaware of the details.  it appears that he hadbeen doing okay at home since his d/c on [12-17], but complainedto his friend over the phone that he needed help d/t increasingsob (which prompted ems call).  per verbal s/o from ed, he hadbeen prescribed prednisone upon discharge on [12-17] for copdexacerbation, but pt did not pick up prescription.  he wasintubated on presentation to the ed on last presentation as wellpresumably thought d/t copd exacerbation.  was diagnosed with peon last admission by cta on [12-10] ("isolated subsegmentalpulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe of uncertain clinicalsignificance").  he was on heparin and discharged on coumadinfor this finding and repeat cta on this presentation does noteven comment on subsegmental pe on prelim read so seems veryunlikely to be causing clinical presentation.  no e/o volumeoverload nor of pneumonia on ct chest and unable to obtain hxre: cough/sputum

doctor on an outpatient basis. also wehave scheduled for you to have a stress test to evaluate yourheart.we made changes in your blood thining medication (coumadin) andyou are to follow up with a nurse practitioner in the[hospital3 ] in order to have this medicationmonitored. also your visiting nurse can help with this. youshould not take coumadin today because your level was slightlyelevated.we gave you a new medication to take for your blood pressure(amlodipine) so now you should take metoprolol, lisinopril andamlodipine for blood pressure.please call your regular doctor or return to the ed if youexperience shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,lightheadedness or any other symptom that concerns you. also beaware that the blood thining medication places you at
