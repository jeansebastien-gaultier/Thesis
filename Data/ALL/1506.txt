in fact those levels were resolvingby the time of discharge. the thrombocytopenia again may berelated to the viral illness and there is no evidence for hemolyticuremic syndrome or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. also duringthis visit , a ppd was checked and it was found that the patient wasanergic , as might be expected with all of his immunosuppressivedrug regimen. at the time of discharge , the patient was feelingwell and no longer complaining of his flu like syndrome.discharge medications: 1 ) aspirin , 81 mg p o q d;
