urine eosinophils negative; urinalysis showed 2+ protein , 23white cells , 1 red blood cell , 1+ bacteria and 2+ squamous cells.on 10/3/07 , urine cultures and blood cultures negative;8/28/07 urine culture positive for mrsa , sensitive to bactrim.on 3/8/07 , left hip washing and aspiration gram-stain negativeand culture negative. on 7/25/07 , c. difficile negative.her relevant studies are as follows: on 10/3/07 , pelvic and hipx-rays demonstrated right hip rheumatoid arthritis , narrowing ofthe right si joint; no acute abnormality or effusion in the lefthip. on 10/3/07 , lower extremity noninvasive studies negative.on 10/3/07 , kub showing gastric antral gas. on 10/3/07abdominal cat scan notable for bilateral peri renal straining( old ) , mesenteric stranding ( old ) , left phlebolith. on 3/8/07echocardiogram , ef of 60% , concentric left ventricularhypertrophy , mild mitral regurgitation , mild tricuspidregurgitation , pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 38 plusright atrial pressure , trace effusion.assessment and plan: a 65-year-old female with a history ofrheumatoid and gouty arthritis , diabetes , sickle cell trait andchronic kidney disease ( baseline creatinine of 1.9 ) , admitted fordiffuse body aches and pains , most likely attributable to arheumatoid arthritis flare.hospital course:1. body aches and joint pains: the differential diagnosis forthe patient's body aches and joint pains initially included arheumatoid arthritis flare , septic joint , crystal joint disease ,intra-abdominal process or plaquenil reaction. her abdominal catscan showed stable peri-renal standing and mesenteric stranding.her creatinine kinase was normal. her urine culture from thesecond day of hospitalization was notable for mrsa. a left hipaspiration was attempted by interventional radiology; no fluidwas obtainable , so a washing followed by drainage was performed ,which had a negative gram-stain and negative cultures.similarly , blood cultures were negative , and an echocardiogramrevealed no evidence of endocarditis as an explanation for hermrsa urinary tract infection. by process of elimination ,therefore , the etiology of her body aches and joint pains wastherefore thought to be rheumatoid arthritis flare , although ofnote , her esr and crp were a bit higher than would be expectedfor a rheumatoid arthritis flare. she was seen by therheumatology consult service , who stated that the plaquenil wouldtake a few weeks to exert its effect. as a result , she wasstarted on prednisone and uptitrated per symptoms. in addition ,she was started on leflunomide. initially , there were plans tostart enbrel , and a ppd placed was negative; however , due to herconcomitant mrsa urinary tract infection , such plans have beendeferred to the outpatient setting.2. mrsa urinary tract infection: as discussed above , her urineculture day after admission was notable for mrsa , sensitive tobactrim. due to hip pain and one mild fever to the range of100.6-100.9 with persistent leukocytosis in the range of 11 to15 , interventional radiology did a hip wash and aspirate that wasnegative , as well as a transthoracic echo that was negative forevidence of endocarditis. surveillance blood cultures similarlywere negative. she was started on vancomycin , with plans tochange to bactrim upon discharge.3. pain control: the patient was on standing and p.r.n.dilaudid , along with oxycontin t.i.d. , the latter of which sherefused due to nausea. she was , therefore , started on a fentanylpatch with standing and p.r.n. dilaudid. she did well on thisstanding and p.r.n. dilaudid. as of discharge , she has done wellon this regimen.4. hypertension: the patient was hypertensive with systolicblood pressures in the range of 170s at multiple times during herhospitalization. this is partly from pain , and partly from poorcontrol of her central hypertension. she was maintained ontoprol , imdur , hydralazine and amlodipine , which were titratedfor a maximum effect. because of refractory hypertension , werecommend that she undergo renal artery imaging as an outpatient.5. diabetes: the patient was started on nph , short-actingprandial insulin and a sliding scale , all of which were uptitrated while she was inhouse.6. acute on chronic renal insufficiency: the patient had acuteon chronic renal insufficiency ( creatinine on admission 2.3 ,baseline of 1.9 ). this was thought to be predominantly prerenal.through her hospitalization , her creatinine gradually decreasedto her baseline of 1.9.medications on discharge: a separate dictation for medicationlist will be supplied when the patient is ready for discharge.escription document: 6-0706017 cssten teldictated by: canoy , irvingattending: bozzo , clevelanddictation id 9360983d: 7/28/07t: 7/28/07
