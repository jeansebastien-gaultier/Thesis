anastomoses. there is expected pneumobilia. inaddition, thereis mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, preferentiallywithin the left system, and also involving the posterior rightbiliary duct which arises from the left system, an anatomicvariant. the pre-contrast study demonstrates even more prominentleft ductal dilation. there are equivocal areas of stenosis inthe peripheral left system without evidence of central stenosis,although the evaluation of stenosis is limited by the presenceof pneumobilia. in the left lobe of the liver, there is subtlehyperemia in the arterial phase without evidence of abnormalityin signal on the t2-weighted images suggestive of edema. noenhancing liver lesions are identified. the gallbladder issurgically absent. nodularity of the right adrenal gland isstable compared to the preoperative study. the left adrenalgland and spleen appear unremarkable. the pancreatic parenchymaenhances homogeneously. the pancreatic duct is not dilated. thekidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically withouthydronephrosis. there are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts.there is mild perinephric fluid bilaterally, right greater thanleft. there is mild thickening of the right lateral conal fasciawhich is probably postoperative. small foci of blooming artifacton the gradient-echo sequences within the mesentery near thearea of surgery are likely related to hemosiderin andpostoperative change. no evidence of new mass or lymphadenopathyis appreciated. the signal within the bone marrow appeared to benormal limits. the lung bases demonstrate small bilateralpleural effusions and associated atelectasis, right greater thanleft.impression:1. subtle hyperemia in the left lobe of the liver withoutevidence of edema, fluid collection, or central biliarystenosis. equivocal stenosis in the periphery of the leftbiliary system is difficult to evaluate given the presence ofpneumobilia. findings could represent subclinical cholangitis,given biliary anastomoses.2. bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left,withassociated atelectasis.3. stable nodularity in the right adrenal gland, unchanged frompreoperative study.[2117-10-6]
