record date: 2071-11-24  thyroid divisionjeanes memorial hospital89 buck stsioux city, fl  76546  vivianlee jorgensonmr# 471-90-84-7november 24, 2071 this is the first visit for ms. jorgenson who is a 64 year old woman who presents for management of papillary thyroid cancer.  her symptoms began in may, 2071, when she felt a prominence in her neck.  she did not experience any dysphagia or voice changes, but presumably was felt to have an abnormality on thyroid examination.  she underwent a thyroid biopsy in june, 2071, at a local hospital.  the pathology which was read at jmh revealed numerous follicular cells with chromatin grooves suspicious for papillary carcinoma.  she was subsequently referred to dr. geiger at jmh for thyroidectomy and underwent thyroidectomy on 9/17/71.  the thyroidectomy was uncomplicated though there was inadvertent displacement of a parathyroid gland and this gland was then reimplanted.  according to the operative report, the carcinoma was felt to be locally extensive though no laryngo-tracheal nerve invasion was present.  the pathology revealed a (r) 6 cm papillary carcinoma with capsular and lymphovascular invasion.  there was an additional focus of papillary carcinoma, follicular variant, in the (l) thyroid lobe that was 0.3 cm.   of note, the tissue was stained for calcitonin and this was negative.  the tumor did stain positively for thyroglobulin.   since undergoing thyroidectomy, ms. jorgenson has done fairly well.  she has been maintained on 75 mcg daily of levoxyl.  she says that she feels generally well on this dose though she does endorse slight fatigue.  she denies any changes in her sleep, hair, skin or bowels.  she does endorse a one pound weight gain over the last two months.  she denies any paresthesias or other symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia.  she denies any history of thyroid disturbances prior to her diagnosis of cancer.  she is now referred for consideration of radioiodine ablation.   past medical history:notable for congestive heart failure.  she has an ejection fraction of 25%.  she also has a history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and anxiety.  no history of childhood irradiation.   current medications:digoxin 0.25 daily; coreg 12.5 mg daily; levoxyl 75 mcg daily; lipitor 10 mg daily; coumadin 5 mg daily; lasix 40 mg daily; captopril 50 mg, tid; labetolol 100, bid; nitroglycerine. allergies:no known drug allergies. social history:remote history of tobacco.  she quit 4 years ago.  she endorses rare alcohol use.  she is married with four children.   family history:negative for thyroid cancer.   physical exam:blood pressure is elevated at 188/92.  weight 208.  pulse 88.  in general this is a somewhat tired, slightly pale-appearing woman in nad.  heent:  perrla.  eomi.  no proptosis or lid lag.  neck: supple with a large well-healed thyroidectomy scar.  no vivianlee jorgensonmr# 471-90-84-7november 24, 2071page 2 remaining thyroid tissue or lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally.  cardiovascular: normal s1, s2, regular rate and rhythm.  abdomen: soft, slightly distended, non-tender, moderately obese.  extremities: trace pedal edema, 1+ distal pulses.  neurologic: reflexes are slightly delayed.  there is no tremor of outstretched hands.   review of labs:of note, include a tsh of 1.65 from august, 2071, that was prior to surgery.  free t4 at that time was normal at 1.1.  calcium prior to surgery was slightly elevated at 10.6 though several calciums drawn after her surgery were in the mid-8 range.  impression:this is a 64 year old woman with a history of congestive heart failure who is now s/p total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer.  ms. jorgenson is potentially at higher risk for recurrence given the fact that she is older at the time of diagnosis, she had a large-size tumor, and she had multifocal disease.  plan:check a tsh and thyroglobulin today for a baseline.  we suspect that she may be undertreated on her current dose of levoxyl.  i have recommended 131i treatment.  benefits and risks were discussed.  in addition, i think she would tolerate thyroid hormone withdrawal.  tsh and calcium were drawn today.  we will plan to arrange  for 131i for january.     hilda vincent, m.d.   brittany farrar, m.d.   bf/cooleycc:aiden geiger, m.d.  _______________________________hilda vincent dd: 11/24/71dt: 12/31/71dv: 11/24/71     not reviewed by attending physician
