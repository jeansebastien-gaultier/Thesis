admission date :2012-06-20discharge date :2012-06-29date of birth :1958-02-28sex :fservice :ficuhistory of present illness :the patient is a 54 year-old female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets , history of pe , recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in 2012-04-23 with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids , which have been given for her brain mets .she was later sent to rehab , but returned early in april with increased cough with exertion with fever to 101 .she was treated with levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased pe burden load , infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer .the patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms and was readmitted on 06-11 with continued dyspnea and fevers .review of cta showed no pe , but there was ground glass opacities on ct , so pcp was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use .her induced sputum was negative and bol was done and also negative .sputum cultures were negative .she was given bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on bactrim .she then continued to do poorly and then returned on 06-19 .she presented on clinic on 06-20 with hypotension for which she was given intravenous fluids .she spiked a fever to 103 with blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic 80 s and with rigors .chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity .the patient was given vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids .today , the patient was found in the bathroom and became hypoxic with saturations in the 80 s and was responsive to oxygen , but was still tachypneic without improvement and was placed on nonrebreather .currently the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for further medical care .currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain or dysphagia .past medical history :1. breast cancer left side diagnosed in 1982 status post 1995 mastectomy with 5 out of 9 positive lymph nodes .she was treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and then later with tamoxifen from 2004 to 2001 .in 2011 she had mediastinal lymphadenopathy treated with taxol and changed to navelbine on 03-28 .she had diagnosed brain mets in 2012-03-25 right side cerebella and parietal for which she was treated with chemotherapy , radiation therapy and decadron .2. history of pulmonary embolism in 2012-04-23 treated with only aspirin secondary to brain mets .3. asthma .4. gastritis .5. questionable history of _______________.medications on transfer :1. protonix 40 mg q day .2. megace 400 q day .3. colace 200 b.i.d.4. aspirin .5. heparin subq.6. prednisone 40 q day .7. ___________ 30 q day .8. clindamycin 900 q 8 .9. levaquin 500 q day .allergies :penicillin .social history :she is an emergency room physician at the pauline .she is married with three children .physical examination :on examination on transfer to the intensive care unit she is febrile with a low grade temperature of 100.1 , tachycardic to 110 , hypotensive 85/49 , tachypneic into the 50 s and 60 s, 95% on nonrebreather .in general , she is extremely tachypneic , difficulty in speaking words .her heart is regular without murmurs , rubs or gallops , slightly tachycardic .her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases .abdominal examination was benign .extremities no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .she is alert and following commands .laboratory :white blood cell count 3.2 , hematocrit 26.6 , platelets 130 , chemistry is 131 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 105 , bicarb 17 , bun 10 , creatinine 0.5 , glucose 105 .calcium 7.3 , phos 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 .she had a gas showing 7.36 , 31 , 96 .she had a ct from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion .hospital course :1. pulmonary :the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray .the exact etiology of the patient 's respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial .there was concern about possible pneumonia .also she had a history of pe and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast ca .given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on ceptaz , levaquin and __________ and clindamycin .lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for pcp douglas .the patient was initially trialed on bipap , but the patient was increasingly dyspneic , increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on 06-22 .earlier during her intensive care unit course she underwent bronchoscopy , which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative .ultimately her intensive care unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from bal lavage were found to be negative .the patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn .clindamycin and _______________ was discontinued early in hospital course .her pcp was thought to be negative .in addition , vancomycin , levaquin were also discontinued .she was later continued on ceftazidine and clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy .as the hubbard regional hospital hospital course went on the patient 's respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator .she was able to oxygenate originally .unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days .later in her intensive care unit course family meetings took place and given the patient 's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become cmo .subsequently she was extubated on 06-28 .the patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory .however , she is cmo and will not be intubated for respiratory distress .2. cardiovascular :the patient was initially transferred to the intensive care unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology , respiratory distress and hypotensive .she required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neo-synephrine .later during her intensive care unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back .it was quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine .she was also given stress dose steroids .later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ecg findings in her inferior leads .her echocardiogram , however , was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55% without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology .as mentioned above the patient 's hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine .by 06-28 , however , the patient had been off of neo-synephrine , but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be cmo per discussion with physicians and her husband / health care proxy .3. hematology :patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from 2012-04-23 .earlier in her intensive care unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient 's respiratory decompensation .however , the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors .she did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds , which were negative .4. infectious disease :as mentioned above patient initially hypotension , febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary .initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin , ceptaz , levaquin , clindamycin and _________.all of her cultures are negative to date .she was negative for pcp and subsequently _____________ was continued and clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage .in addition her vancomycin and levaquin were also discontinued .the patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course .by virtue of discussions on 06-28 the patient was deemed to be cmo and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point .5. gastroenterology :the patient had an abdominal ct earlier in her intensive care unit course , which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology .she was initially supported with tube feeds during her intensive care unit course , but at this point the patient is cmo and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued .disposition :the patient 's attending physician was in constant communication with the patient 's health care proxy her husband .as her intensive care unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement , continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status .ultimately it was decided by 06-28 that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status , it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward cmo care .subsequently all antibiotics , blood draws and supportive blood pressure medications were withdrawn .currently she is comfortable with morphine and ativan prn.currently plans are in the making for arranging for the patient to have home hospice care .please see discharge addendum for further developments in the patient 's care .discharge diagnoses :1. metastatic breast cancer end stage .2. respiratory failure unclear etiology , presumed secondary to possible pneumonia , questionable lymphangitic spread .3. sepsis presumed pulmonary source .discharge condition :grim .discharge medications :1. morphine prn .2. ativan prn .3. tylenol prn .4. albuterol and atrovent nebs prn .rice s.f. thrash , m.d. 15-419dictated by : brett e.x. im , m.d.medquist36d : 2012-06-29 01:15t :
