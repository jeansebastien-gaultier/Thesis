15.4 ). the patient's home situation has beenpreviouisly known to be suboptimal--she had a son who may have beendealing drugs in her home 2 years ago. this time , there was concernover potential tension betwee her and her estranged husband ormedication errors. social work was called and spoke with the daughter.she appears to be appropriately concerned about her mother's healthand open to the idea of placement in an assisted living facility atsome later date. it is clear that an elaborate and effective system hasbeen worked out to monitor and treat the patient's blood sugars. thepatients visiting nurse service ( lan xiemore medical center ) was contacted to reemphasizethe importance of evaluating the patient's medication regimen. thenurse involved in the patient's care also will initiate a requestfor a home health aide to visit the patient more frequently. elderservices was informed to initiate a consult. the social worker atcentter ing community hospital was also informed of this admission. thepatient's home situation is deemed safe for discharge. she willfollow up with dr. fowlie on june vna will visit hertommorrow. the patient's hematocrit dropped slightly the day of discharge. however , the patient was guaiac negative. parenthetically , thepatient had a slightly dirty ua on admission. she was initially treatedbut given her lack of symptoms , this was discontinued.additional comments: your insulin dosage has been decreased because your blood sugar was toolow. your visiting nurse should check your blood sugars and call yourphysician if they are consistently above 150. your dose of lipitor hasbeen increased because your ldl on this admission was 92.discharge condition: stableto do/plan:no dictated summaryentered by: levario , stephen , m.d. , ph.d.
