record date: 2070-01-05     january 5, 2070  matthew wyatt, m.d. notre dame nursing home 4379 new street hyannis, nv 21113 re:  william potts     mr#  109-16-75-8 dear matt: i had the pleasure of seeing mr. potts in follow up today.  as youknow, he recently had a complicated hospital course.  he underwentcardiac catheterization, which revealed serial stenoses of the ladincluding 70% and 90% stenoses.  the first marginal branch had a60% ostial stenosis.  the right coronary artery had 60 and 80%stenoses, respectively.  the pda had a 70% narrowing.  given hisvery significant wish not to have bypass surgery, it was decided toproceed with angioplasty of the right coronary artery as well asthe obtuse marginal.  it was felt that the lad was a small vessel,and not worth going after at this time.  the rca was successfullystented, but was complicated by occlusion of the posterior leftventricular branch.  by the end of the procedure, flow had beenrestored to some degree to the posterior left ventricular branch,but mr. potts rule in for a small subendocardial myocardialinfarction.  due to the closure of the left posterior ventricularbranch, the obtuse marginal branch was not dilated.   mr. potts underwent two exercise tests post procedure. the secondexercise test was performed with mibi imaging.  he exercised fornine minutes on a submaximal bruce protocol, and experienced chestpain.  he had a maximal blood pressure of 148/72 and a heart rateof 121.  mibi images revealed a small nontransmural myocardialinfarction of the basal 1/3 of the inferior wall.  there wasmoderate to severe ischemia of the inferolateral territory in theterritory of the rca. given these findings, it was highly recommended that mr. pottsundergo bypass surgery.   mr. potts was discharged on aspirin, ticlid 250 mg b.i.d.,atorvastatin 20 mg q.h.s., atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., imdur 60 mg q.d. he also takes vitamin e and a multivitamin. of note is that mr. potts has been under quite a bit of stressrecently.  his 89-year-old mother has been at whitehead recoveringwilliam pottsmr#  109-16-75-8              -2-       january 5, 2070 from a hip fracture.  he is having difficulty arranging theappropriate insurance to cover her medications.  mr. potts has been experiencing chest pain since discharge.  thisoccurs with increased activity, and is relief with either restand/or 1 nitroglycerin.  he has decreased his work levelconsiderably, and is relatively sedentary. on physical exam, he was well appearing and in no distress.  he hada blood pressure of 112/70, with a heart rate of 60.  his weightwas 203 pounds.  chest was clear to auscultation and percussion. cardiac exam revealed a flat jvp of 30 degrees, a nondisplaced pmiwith a normal s1 and s2, without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. carotids are 2+ bilaterally without bruits.   his abdomen is soft,nontender.  there is no organomegaly, and no hepatojugular reflux. extremities are without edema. electrocardiogram reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 61. intervals are .16/.08/.42, with an axis of -10 degrees. there areflipped t-waves in iii and avf.   i did not have an oldelectrocardiogram here for comparison. therefore, mr. potts returns today still experiencing angina withmild exertion.  he has agreed to undergo coronary artery bypasssurgery.  he has found out that if he is cleared to go back to workby his physicians, that the screen actor's guild will make a good case for this. there has been precedent for those who have had bypass surgery toreturn to work as an actor.   given mr. potts's currentfeeling, i will make an appointment with dr. earl jacob as soonas possible for him to be seen prior to scheduling bypass surgery. it is somewhat worrisome that mr. potts will be caring for his 89-year-old mother at home, along with his wife.  his mother currentlyuses a walker, and i have warned mr. potts that he really cannotexert himself to any great degree in terms of helping his mother inthe house.  he understands this, and if his chest pain shouldbecome more frequent, intense, or prolonged, he will immediatelycall me.   if mr. potts is not scheduled for surgery, i will see him in twoweeks at ndnh.   with best regards. sincerely,   olivia xing, m.d.monmouth medical center81 clergy streetcasper, nv 33182william pottsmr#  109-16-75-8              -3-       january 5, 2070  dd: 01/05/70dt: 01/06/70dv: 01/05/70 cc:earl jacob, m.d.cardiac surgerylaurel regional hospital96 clergy streetcasper, nv 33182    approved but not reviewed by attending provider
