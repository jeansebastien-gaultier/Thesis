thus we have urged to continue to take unusual non-stereotyped deficits seriously.  she will follow-up with us in 4-6 months or sooner if the need arises. thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.  we look forward to seeing her in follow-up.sincerely,___________________________________olen x. laughlin, m.d.neurology residentpager 63030i have seen and examined the patient with dr. laughlin, resident in neurology, and repeated or observed all the key elements of the encounter before discussing the assessment and management. i agree with the information including the history, examination and assessment/plan documented in this note. i've reviewed and edited this note and agreed with the content prior to finalizing this entry.remigio l. allison, ph.d., m.d. attending neurologistvalley county hospitalvbk 197 russell avenue st. augustine, oktel. 110 227 3266
