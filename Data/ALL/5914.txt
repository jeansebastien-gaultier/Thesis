[first name (stitle) ] [name (stitle) 1255] [doctor last name ] at 9:40 p.m.on [2119-2-8]. the outside hospital ct scan was obtained on hardcopy, and will be brought to the file room in the morning.review of that examination at the time of attending review doesshow increased density of the tentorium, which presumablyrelates to the large volume of iv contrast used for whatapparently was a cardiac catheterization at that facility, whichalso resulted in visualization of the vascular tributaries ofthe circle of [location (un) 431] on this [hospital3 ] ct scan. this tentorialenhancement is no longer seen, likely due to the renal excretionof the contrast [doctor last name 360]..[2119-2-8] cxr: 1. successful intubation.2. diffuse bilateral hazy ground-glass opacities. this isnonspecific, and may represent diverse etiologies depending onthe patient's clinical situation, e.g. aspiration, hemorrhage,or pcp if the patient is immunocompromised. followup isrecommended..[2119-2-10] cxr: since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal tubeand nasogastric tube have been removed. there has been nosignificant change since the prior film of six hours previous.the cardiomegaly, effusions, and some edema are still present..impression: cardiac failure persists..[2119-2-10] ekg: sinus rhythm. left axis deviation. leftbundle-branch block. compared to the previous tracing sinusrhythm is now present.brief hospital course:#) vf arrest/rhythm: most likely a primary arrthymic event(based on story of falling, pulseless with cpr for 10min, andvfib when ems arrived) and secondary to ischemic scar from oldinfacts.  does not appear to be acs (low level ce, stenosis oncath appeared old).  ecgs during hospitalization showed sinusrhythm/sinus tach with lbbb (no old ecgs for comparison).  hewas loaded with amiodarone and maintained on metoprolol for ratecontrol.  he was monitored on telemetry and had no further vfibevents; rhythm strips obtained from ems and the outside hospitaldid not capture any v-fib events. he had an icd implanted on[2119-2-17] and tolerated the procedure well.  he will follow up indevice clinic on [2119-3-1]..#) cad/ischaemia: he was taken for cardiac catheterization andwas found to have rca and lcx occlusion which was thought to belikely chronic. ce's were trended and peaked at low level(likely related to post-code and not consistent with acs).  hewas continued on aspirin, and was titrated up on metoprolol.  astatin was not started right away given his elevated lfts, butonce these normalized, he was started on a reduced-dose statin(20mg atorvastatin).#) pump: cath report showed an ef 15%; multifactorial; ?acutepost code shock, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ?alcoholiccardiomyopathy. hopefully he will recover some function.  arepeat echo showed an ef of 20-25% with no major valvularabnormalities.  he will need another echo in approximately onemonth to assess for recovery of his systolic function..# fevers: he spiked fevers up to 102. he was initially startedon levo/metronidazole and vanco before a known source was foundto cover for likely aspiration pneumonia and line infections.he was then found to have strep pneumo in his sputum andcontinued to spike fevers until he was stabilized on anantibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  there was alsoconcern that these fevers might be related to alcohol withdrawland/or drug fever (from phenytoin, which was stopped on [2-13]).he completed a five day course of azithromycin and hisceftriaxone will be converted to cefpodoxime to complete a10-day course..#) altered mental status/etoh withdrawl: this has amultifactorial origin: vf arrest, etoh, sedation now. per hissister (whom he lives with) that he drank about [1-20] vodka pernight for 4 months and then stopped abruptly ~4 days prior toadmission.  neurology was consulted especially given question ofseizure activity at the osh.  an eeg was negative for seizuresand an lp showed normal cell count, protein, and glucose with noevidence of infection.  a psychiatry consultation was obtainedand they believed that his prolonged delirium may have beenbenzodiazepine intoxication.  he was maintained on standinghaldol and only short-acting benzo's (lorazepam) were used forhis ciwa scale and his mental status gradually improved.  heworked with pt/ot to regain strength, balance, and functioningprior to discharge..#) transaminitis: patient has mildly elevated alt > ast. ggtmildly elevated as well. most likely secondary to mild shockliver in setting of code. underlying liver disease from h/orecent heavy etoh use, high triglycerides (150) could put him atrisk for more damage.  his acetaminophen use was limited to2g/day and he was eventually started on a reduced dose ofatorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia..#) elevated cr: initially had some arf which was most-likelyatn/hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest. he was hydrated andreceived mucomyst for cath.  his cr trended down and recovered..#) fen/gi: he was given protonix for gi ppx given alcohol use.he was also ordered for a speech and swallow eval afterextubation given his still "cloudy" mental status to assess riskfor aspiration.  he eventually passed a speech and swallowstudy, though was recommeded to have close supervision withmeals given his distractability.  heart healthy low sodium diet.medications on admission:none
