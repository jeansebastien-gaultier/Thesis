afib w/ rvr, persistent weakness,lightheadedness, vertigo and doe..1. afib w/ rvr. pt. was admitted with presyncopal symptoms andvertigo, likely from central hypoperfusion, though cerebellardysfunction could not be ruled out given positive romberg insetting of intact proprioception.  she was hd stable onadmission and her inr was 3.6. her afib recurrence was felt tobe exacerbating chf as evident on last tee.  patient wasrestarted on verapamil of 180mg, her bb was increased to 37.5mg[hospital1 ] and her coumadin was held.  on hd#2, patient developed afibwith slow vr, chest pain, diaphoresis and nausea, her ecg wasunchanged and her ce were negative x1.  she subsequentlydeveloped hypotension to mid 70s mmhgs, which did not respond toivf and required dopamine for hd stability.  she was temporarilytransferred to ccu where pressors were weaned within few hoursof arrival.  it was felt that her hypotension was secondary topoor inotropy in setting of bradycardia from multiple nodalblocking agents.  throughout stay in ccu she was borderlinetachycardic and was eventually placed back on small dose oflopressor for hr control. on hd#3 she was transferred to thefloor w/ hr of 100bpm and only on 12.5mg [hospital1 ] of metoprolol.  sheremained hd stable and converted to atrial tachycardia vs. slowaflutter.  her bb was increased and she was started on low dosedigoxin without loading, 0.125 mg eod..on this regiment her hr was difficult to control.  she continuedto remain in afib/flutter with hr in 100s despite 50mg tid ofbb, digoxin.  she was started on amiodarone and underwentcardioversion on [2140-5-24].  this was successful, pt. was in sinusrhythm.  her bb was decreased to 12.5 [hospital1 ] due to temporarybradycardia to high 40s, digoxin was discontinued and amiodaronedecreased to 200mg [hospital1 ].  with this regimen, hr maintained in50s, her doe improved significantly and her lightheadedness anddizziness resolved.  on [5-25] at ~ 11pm patient was noted beunable to speak.  her neurological deficits included r facialdroop and eye lid muscle weakness.  code stroke was called, cthead showed a l distal mca stroke in insular region.  no tpa wasadministered due to inr of 2.9. her inr became supratherapeuticwith inr 3.9 on her day of discharge hence coumadin is held fornow.  it needs to be restarted at 1mg once daily once inr <3.0and needs daily monitoring until stable.  dosing may need to goup once amiodarone dosing decreases to daily dosing on [6-2].also, patient should be started on lisinopril for heartprotection on [6-2]..2. cad - pt. had h/o cad with no h/o mi, cabg or pci.  she had aclean cath in [2127]. based on above pmhx it was not suspectedthat she had flow limiting cad, especially with no elevation ofces in setting of cardiogenic shock.  she ruled out for mi.  shewas continued on bb as above..3. systolic chf.  pt. had a nl ef in [2127] echo, but no otherimaging except a tee, where it was noted that she had mildsystolic dysfunction.  tte here prior to hypotensive episodeshowed global vertricular dysfunction w/ ef of 20-25%  givenlack of significant cad, this was felt to be most likelytachycardia-related cardiomyopathy and treatment was focused onhr control.  pt. was volume overloaded on exam, likelycontributed by the tachycardia and poor filling.  she wascontinued on home dose of lasix. she was started on ace-i,lisinopril 5mg daily, however due to renal failure, cr. 1.5 thiswas discontinued.  her lasix was held on [5-26].  this should berestarted within a day as tolerated by volume status, likely[5-27] (home lasix dose of 40mg po)..4. acute on chronic rf: cr on admission up to 1.3 likely duedecreased co w/ lv chf in setting of afib.  cr recovered to 1.1,near baseline after complications with hypotension, howeverbumpted back up s/p cardioversion in setting of receiving extra10mg iv lasix.  cr improved to 1.2 on [5-26].  her lasix iscurrently being held..5. left mca infarct in the setting of therapeutic inr: mostlikely cardioembolic given the risk factor and patient returnedto afib rhythm from sinus after cardioversion.  pt was not athrombolytic or endovascular therapy candidate due to high inrhence high bleeding risk.  patient was transferred to theneurology service on [5-26] and mri showed that she has acutesuperior division of l mca infarct (precentral gyrus) but not alarge infarct hence safe for anticoagulation.patient remains unable to speak, but can make vocalizations, andis able to swallow. she has mild r facial droop with weakness,more in the arm than leg.  physical and occupational therapyrecommended acute rehab.medications on admission:on discharge from [2140-5-6]:1. flecainide 25 mg po q12h - d/ced on [5-16]2. furosemide 40-80mg po daily -
