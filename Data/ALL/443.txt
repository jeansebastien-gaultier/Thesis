diagnosis :biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .associated diagnoses :1 ) down 's syndrome ,2 ) intestinal malrotation ,3 ) status post ladd 's procedure ,4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .principal procedure :endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .associated procedures :1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .history of present illness :mr. tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with down 's syndrome , who presents to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital with jaundice .mr. tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .a recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .a right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in may of 1993 .this study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .subsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .the patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .on jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the nor chi gay hospital .at operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .the surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .since that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .it should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .the patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .past medical history :1 ) down 's syndrome ,2 ) intestinal malrotation ,3 ) status post ladd 's procedure ,4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .allergies :the patient has no known drug allergies .medications on admission :1 ) tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,2 ) tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .review of systems :remarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .physical examination :the patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with down 's facies , in no acute distress .vital signs :temperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .his head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .his pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .examination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .examination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .there are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .there is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .rectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .extremities :no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .neurological examination is nonfocal .laboratory data :a panel of serum electrolytes is normal .the white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .lymphocyte differential count shows 77% pmns , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .alkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and ast is 221 .total bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .total protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .serum amylase is 43 .calcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .x-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .kub and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .ultrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific st and t-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and avf .the axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital to the general surgery service of dr. lynea moyduhe .a modified upper gi x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .this study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .a temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .the patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .he was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .because of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the gi lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .this procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .these procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .as before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .he was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .however , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .following the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .his serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .condition on discharge :improved .doctors discharge orders :1 ) discharged to group home ,2 ) diet as tolerated ,3 ) activity ad lib ,4 ) followup with dr. moyduhe ,5 )discharge medications :tagamet 400 mg. po q.day , tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .lupevickette l. ca ,
