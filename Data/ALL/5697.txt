therapy .6. cytomegalovirus-positive , no history of cytomegalovirus disease .7. weight loss , presumably secondary to cryptococcosis , and aids .physical examination :very cachectic , malnourished young man , with extensive oral and facial kaposi 's sarcoma .temperature was 98.8 , blood pressure was 114/70 , heart rate was 72 , respirations were 18 .skin :scattered kaposi 's sarcoma , several necrotic lesions , right lower extremity , consistent with chronic ulcers .his head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :fundi were normal , eomi , pupils equal , round , reactive to light .prominent hard

.extremities :no edema .neurologic :question left facial weakness , otherwise nonfocal .laboratory data :sodium was 130 , potassium was 2.0 , phosphorus was 1.8 , magnesium was 1.0 , sgot was 41 , hematocrit was 34.6 , white blood count was 3.4 , platelet count was 134,000 , chest x-ray was clear .head cat-scan :no progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with pml .hospital course :1. malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / cryptosporidiosis .the patient was treated with ppn and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .azt was initiated .stool was negative for cryptosporidium .his diarrhea diminished .he developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of lomotil .however , kub showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .as he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .on this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so neutra-phos k was continued at discharge .lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .2. kaposi 's sarcoma :coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in kaposi 's sarcoma lesions , with
