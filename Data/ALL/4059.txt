admission date :02/01/2002discharge date :02/08/2002history of present illness :saujule study is a 77-year-old woman with a history of obesity and hypertension who presents with increased shortness of breath x 5 days .her shortness of breath has been progressive over the last 2-3 years .she has an associated dry cough but no fevers , chills , or leg pain .she has dyspnea on exertion .she ambulates with walker and a cane secondary to osteoarthritis .she becomes short of breath just by getting up from her chair and can only walk 2-3 steps on a flat surface .she feels light headed when getting up .her shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has been progressive for the past several years .it has not been sudden or acute .she sleeps in a chair up right for the last 2 1/2 years secondary to osteoarthritis .she has orthopnea as well but noparoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .she occasionally feels chest twinges which are nonradiating but are sharp .they last a few seconds on the left side and are not associated with sweating , nausea , vomiting or syncope .she has had lower extremity edema for thelast several years with multiple episodes of cellulitis .her lower extremity edema has increased for the several weeks prior to admission secondary to an inability to elevate her legs due to a broken chair at home .she denies any pleural chest pain .review of systems :negative for headaches , vision changes , numbness , tingling , dyspnea , hematuria , abdominal pain , diarrhea , melena or hematochezia .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .1. cardiovascular :the patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .the patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .she ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .on admission , she was diuresed with lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .the diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .she was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , hdl32 , ldl 64 .the patient had a d-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .it was unclear whether this was old or new .a tte showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .there was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .chest ct was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .the patient had subsequent dobutamine mibi which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .the cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .her blood pressure was high so captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .she will be discharged on lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .she is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .she is on an aspirin .she will be discharged on lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .2. pulmonary ;pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with coumadin .an abg was done which showed ph 7.34 , pco2 78 , po2 92 on 2 liters .her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .she has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .she has episodes of not breathing .bipap was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .she will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .the pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .she needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .3. infectious disease :evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .she was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to keflex with good improvement .she will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .4. hematology :d-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .this clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .she was started on anticoagulation given the positive d-dimer .chest ct was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .it was a poor study .heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then lovenox was started .her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .she will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of lovenox .discharge inr 1.8 .goal inr is 2.0-3.0 .5. fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :low salt diet .low cholesterol , low fat diet .
