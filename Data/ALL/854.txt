vacation in [location (un) 28913].  he developed throbbing frontal occipital headacheeyes and dry mouth and the headache was alleviated onlyslightly with ibuprofen.  about one day later, the patientdeveloped diffuse myalgia, began having shaking chills, andnoted an intense erythema over both legs and injectedconjunctivae and sclerae.  these symptoms persisted overthree days and patient

settings.  he does not recall when his last ppd wasdone.past medical history:   hiv was diagnosed in [2171-2-25].until then, he had a stable cd4 count in the mid 300s andnever had any opportunistic infections or aids definingillnesses until now.  he was in no previous haart.  two weeksago, cd4 count was 171, his viral load 200,000 and wasstarted on bactrim for pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis.2.  status post auricle cyst excision.medications prior to admission:  bactrim, acyclovir.allergies:  no known drug allergies.social history:  the patient is a single homosexual young manwho at the moment has no current partners and is not sexuallyactive.  he denies alcohol or intravenous drug abuse.  he isemployed as a coordinator for a program for the pediatricjustice department, working with hiv positive kids.  he isalso a part-time veterinarian technician.  recently, histravel history included a stay in [location (un) 5953] last week anda stay in d.c. last month, phoenix last year.  at home, hehas three cats.physical examination:  his temperature was 99.6.  bloodpressure 116/62. pulse 93.  respiratory rate 19.  02saturation on room air 98%.  in general, he is an awake,alert and oriented young man, looks slightly uncomfortableand is coughing.  his pupils are equally round and reactiveto light.  he has some conjunctival and scleral injection onboth eyes.  no oral lesions.  his neck exam reveals postcervical tender lymphadenopathy and supple meningismus.auscultation of his heart revealed regular rate and rhythm,no murmurs, gallops or friction rubs. auscultation of thelungs reveals scattered inspiratory crackles in the rightpost mid lung field.  the abdomen is soft, nontender,nondistended and only shows slight right upper quadranttenderness on deep palpation.  bowel sounds are normal activeover all four quadrants.  there is no edema and hisextremities show no cyanosis or clubbing.  the skin on hisback and on both legs proximally shows a diffuse erythemawith no open ulcerations, no desquamations and no petechialpurpura like appearance.  on neurological exam, he is alertand oriented times four.  muscle strength 5/5 throughout.laboratories on admission:  white blood cell count 2.3,hematocrit 37, platelet count 133,000.  differential is 57polymorphonucleocytes, 35 lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, 1eosinophil.  mcv is 85, sodium 136, potassium 3.4, chloride102, hco3 25, bun 9, creatinine 0.9, glucose 92.course of hospital stay:  to rule out meningitis, a head ctwas performed showing no acute intracranial process.  alumbar puncture revealed 2 white blood cells, no red bloodcells, protein of 31, glucose of 53 in cerebrospinal fluid.because of his shortness of breath and to rule out pneumoniaas the source of his symptoms, a chest x-ray was performedshowing no cardiopulmonary process.  the next day, his coughincreased as well as his shortness of breath, and he becamehypoxic.  his 02 saturation dropped to 85% on five liters.another chest x-ray was done showing now an acuteinterstitial and valvular pulmonary edema.  the heart sizenow was borderline with diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema.predominantly perihilar air space opacities and smallbilateral pleural effusions.  induced sputums were performedand the patient was started on intravenous bactrim andprednisone for a possible pcp infection and levofloxacin forany community-acquired pneumonia.  an echocardiogram was alsoperformed showing an ejection fraction of over 65% withnormal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size andsystolic function.as the patient continued to worsen and became increasinglyhypoxic, he was transferred to the medical intensive careunit on day two of his hospital stay.  blood cultures, urinecultures, stool cultures were obtained, but were allnegative.  the patient was also feeling increasingly anxiousand was given morphine, pantoprazole, zolpidem, and heparin.on day three of his hospital stay, the patient had to beintubated due to increasing hypoxia and respiratory distress.another chest x-ray now showed a worsening in aeration.  thepreviously noted pulmonary edema, which had predominated inthe central lung zone, appeared to have extended into moreperipheral portions of both hemithoraces.  it was consistentwith adult respiratory distress syndrome and possiblysuperimposed pneumonia.  the patient was sedated throughfentanyl, lorazepam and also received nicotine.on day five of his hospital stay, hematocrit dropped to 26.7.he had not stooled and laboratory findings were notsignificant for hemolysis; therefore, an abdominal ct scanwas performed to rule out retroperitoneal bleeding.  the ctshowed evidence of bilateral pneumonia aspiration, mildpleural effusions, but no focal consolidations and noretroperitoneal bleeding.  to identify the source of hisinfection, a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed but viralculture was negative.  influenza antigens a and b werenegative.  respiratory syncytial virus [doctor last name 360] was negative.no acid fast bacillus in the smear was detected.  nopolymorphonuclears and sparse oropharyngeal flora could beseen.  fungal culture was negative.  legionella culture wasnegative and pcp was negative.  the sputum showed only sparseoropharyngeal growth.  cerebrospinal fluid culture wasnegative for cryptococcal antigen fungus.  the hiv viral loadwas 343.  serology was as follows:  ebv:  vca, igg antibodypositive.  ebna igg antibody negative.  vca, igm antibodynegative.  toxoplasma igg antibody equivocal.  cmv iggantibody 385 au/ml. hepatitis a antibody negative. iggindeterminate, igm negative, iga negative.  hbs antigennegative.  hbs antibody positive.  hbv antibody negative.hcv antibody negative.  hiv antibody positive.stool cultures showed no ova or parasites. nocryptosporidium, no giardia, no polymorphonucleocytes.  c.difficile was repeatedly negative.  as bactrim has beendescribed to be associated with adult respiratory distresssyndrome, bactrim was discontinued on day five of hospitalstay.  within the next three days, the patient improved,still had fevers, but could be put on a spontaneous breathingventilator on day eight of his hospital stay and extubated onday nine.  the skin signs markedly improved and his 02saturation on hospital day nine was now 98% on four liters ofoxygen/nasal cannula.on day ten of his hospital stay, the patient developedwithdrawal symptoms consisting of agitation, hallucinationsand tachypnea, which could be attributed to the high doses offentanyl he had received.the patient was transferred to the medicine floor on day tenof his hospital stay.  a chest x-ray showed no significantchanges to previous ones.  the patient remained to be anxiousand agitated.  he also still had hallucinations and an oralthrush could be observed and treated with nystatin.  hecontinued to have diarrhea, but his stool cultures remainednegative.  blood cultures were drawn and were still pending.on day 12 of his hospital stay, the patient was started ondapsone for pcp prophylaxis, but the patient developed a rashon both arms and the back again.  as dapsone is known to showa cross reactivity to bactrim in [10-20]%, dapsone wasdiscontinued.  patient continued to have fevers and furtherblood cultures were drawn which are still pending.on day 14 of his hospital stay, all medications exceptprednisone and the nicotine patch were discontinued.  thepatient was seen by physical therapy and started to walkaround the floor.  diarrhea seemed to have gotten better.his temperatures remained at low grade.  on day 15 of hishospital stay, the patient was discharged.  blood cultureswill have to be followed up with dr. [last name (stitle) ], with whom hehas an appointment within two weeks and a infectious diseaseconsult for starting of haart and pcp [name initial (pre) 1102].  hismedications on discharge are nystatin and nicotine patches.
