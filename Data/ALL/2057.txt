final2017-08-15 blood culture ngtdbrief hospital course :mr. lockley was admitted with respiratory failure , thought to be related to mucus plugging as well as a pseudomonal pneumonia .both of these etiologies were treated , and he continued to oxygenate and ventilate well on his usual ventilator settings .however , the issue that dominated the admission was his recent acute decline in mental status .he was thoroughly evaluated by neurology and underwent head ct , mri , lp , and eeg .this work-up demonstrated a small left basal ganglia infarct , likely cardioembolic .however , they felt this event could not account for his new , severe global deficit ; this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .this was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , icu attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a asian interpreter .the end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .he was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .the family was present .medications on admission :jevity 1.2 65 ml / hour continuous with water 240 cc q 8 hourslasix 40 mg iv qam ( given 08-14 )vancomycin 1 gm iv q 36 hours ( last dose at 2000 on 08-13 ) .started on 08-09 )asa 325 mg po qdlansoprazole 30 mg po qamheparin 5000 units sc tidzosyn 4.5 gm iv q 8 hours ( last dose on 08-14 at 1400 ) , started 08-08 .metoprolol 37.5 mg q 12 hours ( last dose 07/25 in am )protein / soy supplement 2 scoops q 12 hoursipratropium / albuterol inhaler 4 puffs qidcompleted course of flagyl 07-25 --> 08-10 .discharge disposition :expireddischarge diagnosis :anoxic encephalopathyacute respiratory failurechronic respiratory failurepseudomonal pneumoniavolume overloadchronic obstructive pulmonary diseasebronchiectasishyponatremiaanemia of chronic diseasesecondary :1. non-small cell lung cancer s/p xrt and chemotherapy in western sahara , s/p right pneumonectomy in 2016-09-21 for recurrence .chronic left pleural effusion .2. sick sinus syndrome status post pm/icd placement3. copd/bronchiectasis4. hypertension5. cad , with known to rca .6. chf with ef 25% on last echo on 2017-07-197. bph8. depression9. left femoral av fistula 2017-04-1910. recent mrsa pneumonia and sepsis 2017-07-21 , treated with vancomycin11. c. difficile colitis treated with flagyl ( completed 08-10 )12. status post peg tube placement 2017-07-2113. status post tracheostomy 2017-07-21 02-22 failure to wean14. status post partial colectomy 1972discharge condition :expiredjohnnie callez md 61-750completed by : opal anne md 40-158 2017-08-23 @ 2054signed electronically by : dr. teresa loper on : fri 2017-09-22 4:29 pm( end of report )
