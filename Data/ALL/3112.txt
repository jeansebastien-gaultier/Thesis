hospital hospital cmed ccu for neurologic compromise , at request of family for second opinion .major surgical or invasive procedure :nonehistory of present illness :30-year-old woman with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary .at chelseawomens ' , about 04-25 , she developed pseudomonal urosepsis and vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .she was transfered to attleborohospital after an arrest .her course was complicated by post-hypotensive coma as well as subarachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds .neurologists at rih felt she had a poor prognosis , but communication between the medical team and family was strained and transfer was arranged to mediplex rehab hospital for a second opinion .her outside course in more detail:patient transferred from women and infants hospital to ri hospital 2016-04-25 with weaknes , vag bleeding x several days , fever 102.5 , hypotension , hypoxic 84% on 4l nc , tachypnic to 30 , with labs significant for lactate 6.3 , wbc <1.0 , plt 9 , hgb 8.9 , and inr greater than lab threshold .intubated for airway protection ( abg 7.39/26.5/73.6 ) and placed on levophed ..placed on reynolds/vanc/fluc/gentamicin for neutropenic fever and thrush initially .ivc filter placed 04-26 .ct abdomen consistent with large necrotic pelvic mass - not sampled 02-12 coagulopathy .04-27 results

urology who did not change stents given severe coagulopathy and worsening renal function .found to be in dic and supported with daily blood products .seen by heme and gcsf started .despite aggressive blood product repletion patient poorly responsive 02-12 alloimmunization .plt count 1 on 2016-04-29 .supported on tpn for nutrition then switched to tube feeds .developed renal failure with cr peak of 2.9.seen by renal who felt was c/w atn ..head ct done 05-04 with bilateral sah and l temporal parenchymal hematoma .also with multiple masses consistent with metastasis .placed on dilantin .neurosurgery consulted .felt secondary to low platelets with no surgical intervention indicated ..mult family meetings given poor prognosis .initially decided not to escilate care and make dnr 05-05 .then progressed to withdrawal of care 05-06 with plan to extubate 05-07 .however there was dissent among neurologists about patient 's ability to recover from the sah while awaiting family members and the patient was changed to full code .given 48 hours off sedation with out change in mental status ( last morphine was 2016-05-07 ) .transferred to mediplex rehab hospital for further work up ..on arrival to the ficu the patient was intubated and non-sedated .past medical history :- retroperitoneal squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary , dx12-15 , s/p xrt ( last tx 2015-04-20 ) , s/p

demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages .there are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images , this could not be further confirmed .a ct would help for further assessment if indicated .there is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain .there are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes , which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema .there is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen .no herniation is identified .images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation .there is increased signal seen along the sulci on flair images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage .a ct would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci .gadolinium-enhanced mri would also help for further assessment ..pcxr 2016-05-11 5:01am:findings :no prior comparisons .tip of the ett projects roughly 5 cm above the carina .a right ij central venous line is at the level of the mid svc .tip of the ngt is below the edge of the image .ivc filter and probable nu stent catheter on the left also noted .heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique , no sizeable pneumothorax .there is a somewhat wedge-shaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia .no other confluent infiltrates are appreciated.pcxr 2016-05-11. 1:46pm:1. mild pulmonary edema .2. vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis , aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations .3. ett 4 cm above the carina with ng tube advancement into the stomach ..eeg 2016-05-12:abnormal portable eeg due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing .these findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy .medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation .there were no areas of prominent focal slowing , and there were no epileptiform features.trans-thoracic echocardiogram 2016-05-12 :the left atrium is normal in size .left ventricular wall thickness , cavity size , and systolic function are normal ( lvef>55% ) .regional left ventricular wall motion is normal .right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal .the aortic valve leaflets ( 3 ) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation .the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation .there is no mitral valve prolapse .the pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined .there is no pericardial effusion .impression :normal global and regional biventricular systolic function .no pericardial effusion ..pcxr 2016-05-13 :mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved , probably resolving edema .there is more rightward mediastinal shift , suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung .enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy .whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances .heart size normal .et tube in standard placement .nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .no appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions.pcxr 2016-05-14 :increasing opacification of the lungs could be due to mild pulmonary edema and multiple micrometastases , worsened slightly since 05-13 at 10:57 p.m.heart size is normal .there is no pleural effusion .the et tube and right picc line in standard placements .nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view .no pneumothorax ..microbiology :05-11- blood cultures : no growth to date on 2/2 bottles05-12- blood cultures : no growth to date on 6/6

metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary who presented to osh 04-25 with pseudomonal urosepsis , vaginal bleeding from tumor extension/anti-coagulation .course complicated by sub arachnoid hemorrhages and intraparenchymal bleeds as well as potential hypotensive brain injury with poor prognosis per neurology .transferred here for second opinion on poor prognosis ..# neurologic - the patient was seen by the neurology consult service and underwent mri head which revealed lesions suspicious for metastases , possible hemorrhages , and findings consistent with hypoxic brain injury .eeg was performed and revealed encephalopathy .the patient 's neurologic exam ( performed after sedation removed >48 hours ) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity .she had some metabolic abnormalities which were corrected ( hypernatremia , hyperphosphatemia ) , but neurologic exam was unchanged .a family meeting on 2016-05-13 was held and these findings communicated with the patient 's family .final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning .at the request of her family , she will be transferred closer to her home in wyoming , to women andinfants hospital ..# respiratory failure - pt arrived on pressure support ventilation , which was changed to assist control to make patient more comfortable .she was originally intubated for airway protection , and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration .due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home , she will remain intubated until transfer , with plan to extubate upon arrival to women and infants hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of dni status ..# fevers/infection - per outside hospital records , the patient grew pseudomonas from blood and urine .at osh , she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin , as well as 13 days ( of 14-day planned course ) of ciprofloxacin and zosyn .she was intially continued on cipro/zosyn .cxr 05-11 revealed ? pneumonia vs atelectasis at the r lung base .continues to spike fever .could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube .urology at osh against pulling tube because coagulopathy and may not be able to replace .fevers also may be from head bleed , cancer , or drug .she was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course .she continued to have fevers .antibiotics were discontinued on 05-15 .no further infectious course was identified and the fevers may have been due to underlying malignant process ..# squamous cell cancer - unknown primary .the patient was seen by the oncology consult service who contacted her outside hematologist dr. pauling .upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin .she then proceed to xrt with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia ( 40-50k ) .given this we were unable to offer her additional therapy. hematology/oncology service at mediplex rehab hospital confirmed her grim prognosis and expective survival in terms of weeks to months with no further available treatment ..# h/o dvt - patient with head bleed which is contraindication to anti-coagulation .ivc filter in place .patient was on pneumoboots while in hospital ..# hypernatremia - improved from osh .total body volume overloaded .water deficit 2.5 l .she was continued on free h20 boluses and d5 1/2 ns and corrected ..# acute renal failure - stable , likely 02-12 hypotension leading to atn that is slowly improving ..# access - r ij changed sterilly over wire 05-01.# fen - tube feeds are held in route in anticipation of extubation ...# code status :after multiple discussion with family and the doctor accepting the patient at women and infants hospital(  dr . pauling ) at ri .she was made dnr/dni and the plan is that she will be transferred to wih and extubated there upon arrival with initiation of full palliative care .the family understood this; all questions were answered and they wished to proceed .they understand that there is no icu at wih and no further advanced pulmonary support can be offered .discharge medications :1. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig :
