duration .the patient recently went to lafullland le and on a flight back to ty in hercent avenue , hisflintpa a , the patient developed increased breathlessness , wanting the airplane to make an emergency landing at ton-balt airport so that she could get medical assistance .the patient mentions that she had been having a breathing problem for the last two years , which had gradually progressed .the patient had not seen a physician at this time and was not on any medications .the patient personally felt that this was secondary to anxiety , however , during the holiday she had a hectic touring schedule and she felt her shortness of breath was getting gradually worse .three days prior to the flight back to maine , the patient said that she developed a cold with progressive productive cough which got worse in the last three to four days prior to admission .the patient was not on any medication for the journey and there was no accompanying fever or hemoptysis .the patient felt excessively dyspneic on the day of her travel , such that she could not walk to the airport and was given a wheelchair with assistance .on the six hour flight , the patient suddenly felt worsening of her shortness of breath and got up and vomited .she was also incontinent .an anesthesiologist on board saw her and felt that she was significantly hypotensive and had the plane land emergently at nebraska .she was subsequently transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .in the emergency room the patient was given nebulizers .she was placed on i.v. heparin and given oxygen three liters with sats remaining somewhere between 85 and 90% .she was also started on zithromax .review of systems :notable for no palpitations , chest pain , syncope , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , claudication , chronic venous stasis , tuberculosis , pneumonia , gastrointestinal disturbances , weakness , easy bruising , anemia or bleeding .past medical history :chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .medications :none .allergies :no known drug allergies .social history :lives with husband , both smoke .family history :father with respiratory distress .details not available .physical examination on admission :the patient was comfortable in the sitting position with pursed lip breathing , afebrile , pulse 120 beats per minute , blood pressure 136/90 .heent exam notable for normocephalic , atraumatic head , pupils equal , round , reactive to light , mild oropharyngeal cyanosis .oropharynx with moist mucous membranes .neck was supple , no thyromegaly , no nodules , 2+ carotids bilaterally .jugular venous pressure 12 cm .chest exam notable for decreased bilateral breath sounds and expiratory wheeze bilaterally , no egophony , hyperresonant , hyperexpanded .cardiac :notable for normal point of maximum impulse , right sided s3 , no murmurs .abdomen soft , non-tender , quiet bowel sounds , no bruits , no hepatosplenomegaly , no scars .neurologically grossly intact .extremities :no edema .bilateral spider varicosities .2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally .no femoral bruits .laboratory data on admission :potassium 5.3 , bun 26 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 211 .arterial blood gases :ph 7.27 , pco2 70 , po2 70 , hematocrit 49% .white blood count was 11.5 , hematocrit 51.6 .chest x-ray :subtle increased density in the left middle lung .electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor r progression v1 through v3 , and p. pulmonale with right axis deviation .hospital course :the patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial ck &apos;s which were normal .echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .the rvsp was estimated at 35 .echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .the patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .the patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .the patient &apos;s heparin was subsequently discontinued .pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient &apos;s room air sat hovering around 90% .microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .the patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .it was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative pa gram , plus / minus vq , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-ck &apos;s and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .it was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic co2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .the patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .pulmonary service was consulted .they recommendations included smoking cessation , recommendation for o2 use if flying back home to missouri , continuing antibiotics for a 14 days course , albuterol , atrovent mdi &apos;s and follow-up of pleural effusions with one month repeat chest x-ray .it was subsequently arranged for the patient to transfer back to balau for care there with a pulmonologist as well as her primary-care physician .the patient was discharged in good state of health , ambulating .sats with and without o2 were above 88% .a complete copy of the medical chart was sent with the patient to lo .medications on discharge :cefuroxime 500 mg. po b.i.d. times 10 days , albuterol inhalers 2 puffs q4 hours , atrovent inhalers 2 puffs q6 hours , prednisone 40 mg. po qday , then taper as directed by primary-care
