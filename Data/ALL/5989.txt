[known lastname ] presented to the ed with a chief complaint of hemoptysis# hemoptysis - chest film demonstrated multifocal opacities inthe rul and rll. given the patient's prior history of tb and theinability to exclude this on presentation, he was admitted to anegative-pressure room.  on the floor, he remainedhemodynamically stable. he had three negative afbs and wasremoved from respiratory precautions. he had a ct scan on [7-28]which showed peribronchovascular opacities and a 1cm x 2cm rightlung nodule felt to be chronic granuloma/prior infectionsequelae vs. malignancy. on [7-29], he again had moderatehemoptysis and reportedly vomited blood and had black stools.pulmonary was consulted, and he was started onceftriaxone/azithromycin empirically for cap on [2193-7-31].durnig his course, he had a recurrence of massive hemoptysis.he was bronched on [8-1] and found to have substantial bleedingfrom the posterior segment of right upper lobe. he then went toir and had embolization of the right bronchial artery and rightupper intercostal arterial branch. after the procedure, he wasintubated with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube to preventextravasation of blood into the left lung if bleeding recurred.he remained stable and was extubated on [8-2]. ceftriaxone wasreplaced with cefpodoxime on [8-3]. his pulmonary hemorrhage wasattributed to inflammation of prior eroded tissue from old tb,with a new pneumonia as the precipitant.# elevated creatinine - he also had mild renal insufficiencywhich was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy after the irprocedure. the patient was transferred to the medical floor on[2193-8-3], and his creatinine normalized with iv fluids and time.he demonstrated continued clinical improvement, with smallamount of hemoptysis post-procedure.  he remained afebrile withnormal vital signs after transfer from the icu.  he wasdischarged on [2193-8-4] and will complete a 7 day course of bothazithromycin and cefpodoxime, to be completed on [2193-8-6].  hewill schedule a follow up appointment with dr.
