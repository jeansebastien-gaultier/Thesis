admission date:  [2106-7-4]       discharge date:  [2106-7-13]date of birth:   [2056-12-21]       sex:  mservice:  cardiothoracic surgeryhistory of present illness:  this is a 49-year-old gentlemanwith a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with anestimated ejection fraction of approximately 20%.  he hadbeen accepted by the [hospital 4415] hearttransplant service and was at home listed as a status 2awaiting cardiac transplantation.on [2106-7-4] the patient had new onset chest pain and wasadmitted to the hospital where he ruled in for myocardialinfarction.past medical history:  1. type 1 diabetes.  2. known coronaryartery disease status post multiple cardiac catheterizations.he is status post automatic implantablecardioverter-defibrillator placement.  he has ischemiccardiomyopathy.  3. hypothyroidism.medications on admission:  1. coreg 25 mg p.o. q.d.  2.toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.  3. plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  4. aspirin325 mg p.o. q.d.  5. aldactone 12 mg p.o. q.d.  6. synthroid0.125 p.o. q.d.  7. lantus insulin 25 q.d.  8. humalogsliding scale subcutaneous insulin coverage.allergies:  ace inhibitor cause a cough.hospital course:  the patient was taken to the cardiaccatheterization laboratory where he was found to havesignificant multivessel coronary artery disease including a30% left main and 99% left anterior descending coronaryartery, totally occluded left circumflex and totally occludedright coronary.  his left ventricular ejection fraction wasestimated at 13% at cardiac catheterization.  the patient wasthen referred to the cardiothoracic surgery service forassessment for coronary artery bypass grafting.the patient subsequently preoperatively was managed on thecardiology service approximately [2106-7-8], was noted to havea dropping hematocrit and was sent for an urgent ct scan ofhis abdomen and pelvis to rule out a source of hematocritdrop.  he was found to have no intra-abdominal norretroperitoneal hematoma at that time however it was notedthat he had a pericardial effusion.  the patient also on[2106-7-8] underwent a myocardial viability study which showeddiffuse uptake consistent with diffuse viability of leftventricular wall.  the patient remained on the cardiologyservice and was taken to the operating room on [2106-7-12] wherehe underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 by dr. [first name (stitle) ][last name (prefixes) ].  he had a lima to the lad, saphenous vein to therpl, saphenous vein to the d1, to the om.  the patient had apreoperative intra-aortic balloon pump placed at thebeginning of the case prophylactically due to his poorejection fraction.  the patient did wean from cardiopulmonarybypass and his chest was being closed when he was noted tohave significant problems with hypotension.  at that time itwas felt appropriate to place him on a left ventricularassist device.  he was also placed on vasopressin,epinephrine, levophed, and milrinone drips.  with the supportof the left ventricular assist device and the pressors andinotropic agents the patient was successfully transportedfrom the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unitin the evening of [2106-7-12] where he proceeded to wake up fromgeneral anesthesia.  he required some fluid resuscitationwith blood products over the course of the first fewpostoperative hours and remained relatively stable on thesupport.on physical examination at this time, neurologically thepatient is sedated on propofol but is easily awoken, followscommands, nods his head appropriately and moves allextremities.  from a cardiac standpoint the patient has ablood pressure from 90 to 110s systolic with a mean arterialpressure of 65 to 70, presently on vasopressin, epinephrine,levophed and milrinone drips.  he is on an left ventricularassist device, abiomed bvad 5000 i, with liter flows between5 and 5.6 liters per minute.  his thermodilution cardiacoutput has also been in the 5 to 6 liter per minute rangewith an svo2 of approximately 70%.  the patient's lungs arerhonchorous.  the patient has adequate oxygenation at thistime.  his abdomen is soft, nontender.  his extremities arewarm with minimal edema and he has positive doppler signalsin both of his feet.  immediately postoperatively thepatient's intra-aortic balloon pump was removed at thebedside.  manual pressure was held for 35 minutes.  the groinlooks good without signs of bleeding or hematoma and thepulse remains audible by doppler in his balloon foot, whichis the right.current medications:  1. iv vasopressin drip at 0.8 units perminute.  2. epinephrine 0.025 mcg per kg per minute.  3.levophed 0.02 mcg per kg per minute.  4. milrinone 0.5 mcgper kg per minute.  5. propofol 30.  6. vancomycin 1 gram q.12 hours.  7. carafate 1 gram q. 6 hours.  8. aspirin 325 mgq.d.  9. ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d.  10. insulin drip at 29units per hour, maintaining a blood sugar in the 120-140range at this time.most recent laboratory data:  white blood cell count 10.4,hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 167.  sodium 138, potassium3.7, chloride 103, co2 17, bun 16, creatinine 0.9, glucose131.  his most recent prothrombin time is 15.1 with an inr of1.5, ptt is 42.6.  blood gas from this morning is ph 7.42,paco2 32, pao2 116, bicarbonate 21, base deficit -2.initially postoperatively the patient had a significantmetabolic acidosis which resolved with a total of [3-1] amps ofbicarbonate over the course of the night, blood products andfluid resuscitation.discharge diagnoses:  ischemic cardiomyopathy with leftventricular assist device placement status post coronaryartery bypass grafting x 4.condition:  his condition remains critical.disposition:  he is being transported to the [hospital 8503] under the care of dr. [last name (stitle) 36737] for assessmentfor heart transplant as well as possible heartmate leftventricular assist device placement in the next few days.
