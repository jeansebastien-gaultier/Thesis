myocardial infarction .associated diagnosis :lower gastrointestinal bleed .history of present illness :the patient is a 65 year old portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .he was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .on the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.he was taken to the pre health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm st elevations in leads v1 to v4 and 2 mm st elevations in lead v5 .he was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .he was transferred to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital hemodynamically stable .he arrived in the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .it was notable for 4 to 7 mm st elevations throughout the precordium with qs in leads v1 and v2 , with 2 mm st elevations in avl and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and avf .the initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .he was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , ativan and a lidocaine drip .because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .past medical history :notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .medications on admission :noneallergies :penicillin , which gives him a rash .social history :his habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .physical examination :the patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .his pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .the head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .the neck was supple .the carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .on cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet s1 and s2 , no murmurs .he had an audible s3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .on lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .his abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .on rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .his extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .laboratory data :the hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , co2 27.4 , bun 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .the electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , st elevations in v4 through v6 , i and avl , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with q waves in v1 to v3 and reciprocal st depressions in leads ii , iii and afv .the chest x-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .hospital course :the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .he had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .the left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the micu .on hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .the patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with serax .the lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .on the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .the intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .after removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .on the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .however , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the micu .the peak cpk level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% mb fraction .on the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .an echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .on transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .he was evaluated by the gi service who felt that , given the patient &apos;s course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .the patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .he exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified bruce protocol .he did not have chest pain .there were st and t wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .the thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .these findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ace inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .the patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .discharge diagnoses :1. acute myocardial infarction .2. lower gastrointestinal bleed .medications on discharge :enteric coated aspirin , 1 po qd ; isordil , 10 mg po tid ; serax , 15 mg qhs x five days ; carafate , 1 gram po bid ; lotrimin cream 1% to affected areas on the skin ; multivitamins , 1 qd .procedures :1. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty .2. repeat cardiac catheterization .3. exercise stress testing with thallium .complications :none .condition on discharge :stable .disposition :the patient is to follow up with dr. ra shuffburle in gi clinic in one week , dr. telshey patient in cardiology clinic in one week , dr. ______________ in lifairg louen likison hospital medical center in three weeks .estimated disability :one month , to be determined by follow up with dr. dose .ca shuff , m.d.tr :wa / bmotdd :8/9/93td :08/10/93cc :
