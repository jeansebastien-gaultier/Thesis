mrs haynes is a very pleasant 67 yo female pmh significant for a diagnosis of sarcoidosis from a nodule biopsies on her left eye back in october.  she subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy in april of this year for bulky adenopathy which the pathology was also consistent with sarcoidosis.  she present for evaluation of abdominal pain that has been present for months but became unbearable prompting a visit to the emergency room.  mrs. haynes reports that over the past few months she has been experiencing weight loss, early satiety, night sweats and fatigue.  he abdominal pain is

abdomen pelvis-  5/18/02    impression:           1. urothelial thickening involving renal pelvises, ureters, and     bladder. findings consistent with infection versus less likely     inflammation.     2. bladder calculus.     3. abdominal lymphadenopathy, increased since prior study, may be     consistent with progression of known sarcoid, versus malignancy.     4. adrenal nodules, unchanged. ct chest 3/16 impression:     1. mediastinal, bilateral hilar, supraclavicular,     retroperitoneal, and gastrohepatic adenopathy likely represents     lymphoma rather than sarcoidosis given the patient age and     abdominal involvement.     2. bilateral adrenal nodules. path: 04/10/2102 pathologic diagnosis:a. specimen designated "4r lymph nodes, biopsy" (including fsa):     lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see note).b. specimen designated "4r lymph nodes, biopsy":     lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomata (see note).impression:  mrs. haynes is a pleasant 67 yo female with biopsy demonstrating non-caesating granululoma in a left eye nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes.  cx data was not obtained.  however, hx is not suggestive of past tuberculosis risk factors.  clinical picture very suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis.  at this time she does not have an absolute indication for sarcoid treatment but she may benefit symptomatically from low dose steroids.  at this time she is reluctant to start steroids without discussing it with her family and dr. villalpando.recommendations:   -would consider cardiac mri given her hx of palpitations as cardiac sarcoid is an absolute indication for treatment.-would recommend checking ppd-would recommend starting prednisone 30mg po qday.  will discuss this further with patient and family tomorrow.  there is no rush for treatment at this time and we could waite until dr. villalpando is available to speak with mrs. haynes.-would also recommend bactrim prophylaxis while she is on greater than 15 mg po prednisone.  1 ds m/w/f.-will follow.thank you for this interesting consult. please call with questions. patient seen examine and case discussed with dr. layton. __________________________________hayden lawrence,
