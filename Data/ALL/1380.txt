on5/1/2005 , the patient underwent cardiac catheterization whichrevealed 100% stenosis of the lad , 60% stenosis of the leftcircumflex , 80% stenosis of the first marginal , and 100% stenosisof the rca , with collateral flow from the lad to the rca. herlad was stented. she was treated with integrilin , aspirin ,plavix , lopressor , captopril , and lipitor. her peak cardiacmarkers were on 8/29/2005 and were as follows: ck 3344 , mb386.4 , troponin i 191.4. her ekg changes were slow to resolve.her admission ekg revealed normal sinus rhythm , first-degree a-vblock , and new right bundle-branch block. on 8/29/2005 , thepatient developed transient complete heart block. gel pads wereplaced , but the patient regained her native rhythm. a temporarywire was placed. on 4/21/2005 , the temporary wire failed tocapture and was adjusted. on 1/23/2005 , the patient was takenback to the cardiac catheterization lab with the idea ofprecluding any further ischemic triggers to complete heart block.a stent was placed in the first marginal. on 10/4/2005 , earlyin the morning , the patient aroused from bed ( despite bed-restprecautions ). her temporary wire was apparently dislodged. thiswire was then pulled. the patient developed chest pain withoutekg changes. she subsequently developed hypotension. there wasclinical evidence of tamponade including distant heart sounds andcool extremities. the patient was taken emergently to thecardiac catheterization lab. a stat echo performed in thecardiac catheterization lab revealed a large pericardial effusionwith diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right ventricle.a pericardiocentesis was performed for 600 ml of bloody fluid.it was thought that the temporary wire had perforated the rightventricle and that the whole failed on its own. in the cardiaccatheterization lab , the patient developed asystole. a temporarywire was replaced. on 8/3/2005 and 10/22/2005 , echocardiogramshowed no evidence of pericardial effusion reaccumulation. thepatient's ejection fraction was preserved at 45 to 50%. therewas evidence of hypokinesis of the apical , inferoseptal , andbasal and mid inferior walls. on 10/22/2005 , the patient'ssecond temporary wire was pulled. the patient remained in hernative rhythm. she had rare runs of asymptomatic nsvt rangingfrom 5 to 11 beats. she was without chest pain or shortness ofbreath for the duration of her hospital stay. it was thoughtthat the patient did not require a permanent pacemaker or aicdplacement at the present time. the patient was discharged onaspirin , plavix , toprol , lisinopril , and lipitor. she had notbeen on a statin previously. her lfts will require monitoring.notably , her fasting lipids included total cholesterol of 136 , anhdl of 38 , an ldl of 98 , and triglycerides of 149.2. pulmonary: the patient required oxygen by nasal cannuladuring her hospitalization. status post pericardiocentesis , shewas weaned off oxygen. on the day of discharge , she was able toambulate on room air without desaturating.3. endocrine: diabetes mellitus. the patient was on oralantihyperglycemics at home. in-house , she was treated standinglantus as well as novolog standing and sliding scale q.a.c. shewas discharged on metformin. she has a normal creatinineclearance.4. heme: hematocrit. the patient's hematocrit dropped downfrom the low 40s on admission to the low 30s on discharge. thisdrop was attributed largely to blood loss ( right groin hematomastatus post 5/1/2005 cardiac catheterization - subsequentlystabilized; and pericardiocentesis on 10/4/2005 ). there was adesire to keep the patient's hematocrit above 30 given her acutecoronary syndrome; however , the patient refused for transfusion.in the days prior to discharge , the patient's hematocritstabilized. if her hematocrit remains low , she might benefitfrom outpatient anemia workup , including iron studies , b12 ,folate , reticulocyte count , and smear.5. infectious disease: urinary tract infection. the patientdeveloped a urinary tract infection. urine culture on 8/29/2005showed greater than 100 , 000 proteus. she was treated initiallywith levofloxacin , then bactrim. a urine culture from 8/3/2005showed no growth.6. postprocedure prophylaxis: the patient was treatedtransiently with ancef status post temporary wire placement.blood cultures on admission were negative. blood cultures werenot rechecked given that the patient remained afebrile withoutsigns of bacteremia.discharge medications: aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily , colace 100 mgp.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) 1 tab sublingual every5 minutes x3 doses , lipitor 80 mg p.o. daily , plavix 75 mg p.o.daily , lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. daily , toprol xl 150 mg p.o. daily ,metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.discharge instructions: the patient was instructed to take hermedications as directed , particularly the plavix. the patientwas instructed to follow up with dr. vanbelle in clinic on6/24/2005 and with dr. bradly moerke at the medwinds hospital .  she was instructed to call her doctor and presentto the emergency room if she experienced any chest pain ,shortness of breath , palpitations , fainting , or any othersymptoms concerning to her.disposition: the patient was discharged to home with homeservices.escription document: 1-2429268 hfdictated by: rasavong , bartattending: agueda , dewitt j.dictation id 6667106d: 1/30/05t: 1/30/05
