or:she had an upper gi series on 8/30/05 , a video swallow on1/19/05 , and upper endoscopy on 11/6/05 .hospital course:in summary , in terms of the hematemesis from the gi standpoint ,there was no blood shown in the emesis during thehospitalization. her symptoms were treated with reglan ,initially iv than p.o. the differential diagnosis on admissionwas gastroenteritis due to sick contacts , gastritis secondary topervious history of nsaid use , ulcer , recurrent esophagealstricture , other enteritis or dka given elevated glucose levelsand anion gap on admission. other things considered wereatypical cardiac ischemia. in order to evaluate the cause of thehematemesis , she underwent the barium swallow on 8/30/05 .unfortunately , this test was canceled prematurely due to evidenceof aspiration on the initial swallow. she was kept n.p.o. from10/21/05 to 07 until video swallow could be performed ,which showed minimal aspiration with swallowing , but wasimproved with chin tuck maneuver. an initial diet of mechanicalsoft with liquids was recommended with advancement as necessary.gi was consulted , dr. costine attending , and upper endoscopywas performed on 11/6/05 , which showed nonerosive esophagitisand a hiatal hernia , both known by history , otherwise , there wasno ulcerations and no stricture. the emesis subsided during thehospitalization. she was continued on nexium while in-house aswell as reglan p.r.n. and tolerated regular house feeds prior todischarge with no emesis. as an aside , she developed diarrheawhile in-house. given history of pervious

9/9/05 .  the event on 11/27/05 occurred at 5:00 p.m.with heart rates in 200 range. she was treated with lopressor 5mg followed by diltiazem 20 mg x2 , which then caused reduction inthe heart rate to

cultures are pending.her pulmonary status remained stable with good o2 saturation onroom air throughout the hospitalization. from an endocrinestandpoint , her diabetes was moderately controlled during herhospitalization. she was switched from her standing nph toregular insulin sliding scale while n.p.o. because of low bloodsugars. after initiating p.o. intake , her sugars were initiallyuncontrolled and aggressively managed with regular insulinsliding scale in addition to an nph standing regimen. upondischarge , ms. azen was afebrile with heart rate of 72 , range68-93 , normotensive with the
