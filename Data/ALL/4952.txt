tumor stage t2n1m0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).postoperative radiation therapy:  for the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  he was treated with a total dose of 45 gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using imrt, planned with 4d ct simulation.  this treatment was administered in combination

incisors, associated with barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  on 10/17/69 ct of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  on 10/21/69 repeat ct of the chest showed an 8 mm lll nodule and r-sided pleural thickening.  upper eus showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal ln, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  on 10/22 fna of a porta hepatis ln was negative.he underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pt2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 ln (n1).  interval
