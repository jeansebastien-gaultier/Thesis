acute renal failure fromhydralazine induced pauci-immune glomerulonephritis admittedwith brbpr and atrial fibrillation with rvr..# gib: given significant orthostasis, hct down to 24 (baseline30) and history of pud, initially concerned about ugib.  nglavage was negative which was reassuring.  she was given 2u prbcwith stable blood counts and hemodynamics.  she had an egd on[4-13] without e/o active bleeding.  per gi likely lgib and willneed c-scope sometime during this admission.  she was also given2u ffp given coagulopathy and concern for gib and need forendoscopy. bleeding ceased, however, colonoscopy deferredsecondary to difficult to control afib with rvr. she shouldfollow-up as an outpatient for colonscopy..# af with rvr: she had been on sotolol for several years untilher recent admission to [hospital1 18] when this was discontinued in thesetting of her worsening renal failure.  she was noted to haveaf with rvr to 140s.  initially felt to be worsened by volumedepletion with gib.  however, despite blood products, sheremained tachycardic and thus nodal agents were resumed.anticoagulation was held in acute setting, with coagulopathyreversed in the setting of gib. she was uptitrated on her poregimen to metoprolol 50mg tid and diltiazem 30mg qid which kepther hr in reasonable control until she underwent a bowel prepfor her colonoscopy. on the morning of the scheduledcolonoscopy, she developed afib with rvr in the setting ofdehydration evidence by alkalosis and hypernatremia. shereceived agressive iv hydration and multiple iv medications tohelp control rate. her heart rate initially responded andstabilized in the 90-100's. however, the following evening, sherequired another bowel prep and her heart rate escalated to the150's. she received additional iv nodal agents and her poregimen was increased. an electrophysiology consult was obtainedand the recommendation was for rate control and uptitration withher current medications. rhythm control was deferred. she wasrestarted on anti-coagulation on hd#5 with a heparin gtt. a teeshowed no evidence of thrombus. a cardioversion was attemptedand was unsuccessful. the patient was loaded with amiodarone andthe metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [hospital1 ] to achieve adequaterate control. she was started on diltiazem which was uptitratedto 45mg po qid.  hr was in the 80s on discharge.
