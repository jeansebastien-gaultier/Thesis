admission date:  [2108-8-22]     discharge date:  [2108-8-30]date of birth:   [2036-5-17]     sex:  mservice:  neurologyhistory of present illness:  mr. [known lastname ] is a 72-year-oldgentleman with a history of hodgkin's disease was transferredhere from [hospital3 ] hospital because of intractable seizuresand decreased mental status.he was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,until [8-17] when he began to become "confused" and developedgait difficulties.  according to the family, mr. [known lastname ] wasbehaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by familymembers. [name (ni) ] was also having gait difficulties that wereconsidered to be mild, according to the family members.because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [hospital3 ] hospitalon [8-17]. at that time, a head computed tomography wasreported as normal. he was give a diagnosis of transient ischemicattacks and was d/c home.over the next three days, mr. [known lastname ] problems graduallyworsened.  on [8-20], he was at home when he developed anonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    hewas transferred to the nearest emergency department where hecontinued to have generalized seizures.  he was given adilantin load and phenobarbital.  his systolic blood pressureat that time ranged between 120 and 200s.a repeat head ct was reported to be normal. despite the dilantinload and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to haveclinical seizured. therefore, he was started on an ativan dripand was admitted to the intensive care unit. his dilantin wasalso continued on therapeutic levels.  despite the ativan dripand dilantin therapeutic levels, mr. [known lastname ] continued to beunresponsive and had intermittent seizures. the rate of theativan iv infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. alumbar puncture was performed on [8-20] at [hospital3 ] hospitaland showed normal values.a mri with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffusehyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (r > l) and both thalami.at this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsiveand was therefore transferred to [hospital1 18] for further evaluation andcare.past medical history:1.  hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [2106-4-11] afterdeveloping a respiratory infection.  this was diagnosed asnodular sclerosing hodgkin's disease; stage iii-b withpositive [doctor last name ]-sternberg cells.  a bone marrow biopsy was donein [2106-8-11] which showed no bone marrow involvement.2.  status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, cytoxan,vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  this had to bediscontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lungdisease and because of myelosuppression with episodes ofneutropenic fever.  most recent surveillance computedtomography scan revealed gradual interval progression ofhodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymphnodes.3.  borderline hypertension.4.  colonic polyps.5.  tuberculosis.6.  cataracts.7.  macular degeneration.medications on admission:  aspirin, prevacid, and tylenol.ativan drip and dilantin were started at the outsidehospital.allergies:  ceftin (causes a rash).social history:  the patient was a retired chemistry teacherand lived in [hospital3 ].  he was married with no alcohol orintravenous drug use.family history:  family history was noncontributory.concise summary of hospital course:mr. [known lastname ] was admitted to the intensive care unit of [hospital1 18] on[2107-8-23]. a repeat lp on admission showed normal cells, glucoseand protein. a csf sample was also obtained for viral culturesand different viral and fungal ab titers (including west nilevirus, arboviruses, hsv, hbvs). routine cultures for bacterial,tb and other infectious agents were also normal. cytology wasnormal.despite the therapeutic levels of ptn and the iv infusion ofativan, electroencephalogram (eeg) on admission showedepileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoingepileptict activity. therefore, a penotarbital infusion wasstarted. the pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain aburst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, eeg monitoring. inparticular, the eeg showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10seconds. dilantin and depakote were continued as well. at thispoint, pressors were started to compensate to the pentobarbital-induced decreased cardiac function.mr [known lastname ] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonanceimaging examination ([8-24]) showed multicentric areas of t2hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal aswell as bilateral thalami. laboratory studies throughout mr.[known lastname ] admission included several blood cultures, urine culturesand extensive toxic metabolic workup. another lp forcerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic andcytological analysis was also performed.in order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. a brainand meningeal biopsy was performed on [8-24] in the rightfrontal lobe.in regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, thepatient received iv solu- medrol and high doses of antibioticswith broad coverage.  the infectious disease team was alsoinvolved in the care of mr. [known lastname ]. all the tests performed on histissues and fuids obtained under request of the id team, hadthus far come back normal.brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningiticeosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronaldamage (red neurons). there was no evidence of an infectious[doctor last name 360] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.several attempts in decreasing the dose of pentobarbital resultedin an increased epileptiform activity on bedside eeg monitor.mr. [known lastname ] condition deteriorated even further. he had developedileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  he had been intubatedthroughout his entire stay in the intensive care unit and wasincreasingly dependent on ventilatory support.at this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosiswas thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. aftera family meeting, it was decided that mr. [known lastname ] would no longerbenefit from aggressive support.  therefore, he was extubatedand expired briefly thereafter.                          [name6 (md) 725] [name8 (md) 726], m.d.
