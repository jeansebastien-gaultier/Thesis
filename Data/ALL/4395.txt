hospital course refers to thepatient's icu course.  he was on the medical floor for 16 hoursprior to discharge and was stable during this time..# septic shock:  met criteria for septic shock.  on presentationhad clear pulmonary source of infection.  initial sputums grewout pneumococci.  patient relatively immunocompromised due bothto cancer diagnosis and chronic steroid use secondary to braintumor.  on admission patient had central line placed, cvps maintained[7-15].  patient needed pressors to maintain bp initially.  onlevophed, but developed some tachyarrhythmnias (afib with rvr)so was switched to neo.  initially covered with zosyn, levofloxand vanco.  patient was continued on atovaquone for pcp[name initial (pre) 6187].  patient was also intubated on presentation, andmaintained on ac.  patient had ekgs without signs of ischemia,and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.  pressors werelargely weaned by hd #3.  he did rarely require brief periods ofneosynepherine, due to too-rapid diuresis.   the patient had a normal cortisol stim test.   historically, it was noted that the patient had a red leftknee a few days prior to admission.  this knee was tapped byortho and found to be floridly septic.  he was taken to the orand washed out by ortho (please see seperate op note for fullaccounting of this procedure).  this infection was found to bemssa, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of hisr chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.  he wasmaintained on a 6week course of nafcillin for this staphinfection.  a tee demonstrated no signs of endocarditis.infectious disease was consulted and assisted with hisantibiotic regimen.   the patient completed a full 14d course of levoflox forpneumonia.  the patient also had a full course of clinda for aquestion of toxic shock syndrome or aspiration pneumonia.  hisvanco was d/c'd after 5d due to only mssa growing out.  on [12-20]his pre-existing r chest chemo port was noted to be purulent andwas removed by surgery.  this grew out mssa.  once more, thenafcillin was continued for 6week total course.  a [12-21] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a courseof fluconisol as per id.  he recieved a full ophtho eval whichdemonstrated no ocular involvment.  planned course of treatment is for nafcillin for total of 6weeks to end [1-30], fluconazole for 2 weeks total to end [1-9], andceftriaxone to end [1-10]..# afib c rvr:  new-onset afib in the face of sepsis,hypotension, infection.  patient initially controlled withboluses of diltiazem or lopressor.  often returned into afibduring times of increased activity or stress.  usedneosynepharine which seemed less arrhythmagenic.  amiodarone wastried initially for control, but the patient became tobradycardic on this [doctor last name 360].  as patient was weaned from pressorshe was begun on a regimen of metoprolol which seemed to controlhis rate well.  he did ocassionally return to rvr, which wastreated with boluses of dilt or lopressor with good effect. hewas then restarted on amiodarone [1-1] and responded to it well.due to his brain tumor he was note anticoagulated during histime in the icu. the risks and benefits were discussed. it wasfelt that the risks of ich outweighed the benefits of strokeprevention at this time. plans were made to readdress this issueonce the patient's mental status improved..# septic arthritis:  as above, had septic arthritis of l kneetreated via washout by ortho on [12-17].  nafcillin x6weeks per idstarted on [12-19]. nafcillin is scheduled to finish on [1-30].patient did have a swollen l wrist later in his course, but thiswas tapped by ortho and never grew out any bacteria.plastics-hand was consulted and felt clinically that this wasnot a septic joint, instead just a manifestation of his chronicra. ortho also felt it was not prudent to washout his r knee, whichwas clinically asymptomatic during his icu course. his l kneehealed well and the staples and drain were removed withoutincidence.  he has been signed off from direct ortho care, andis weight-bearing as tolerated at time of icu discharge..#respiratory status:  patient was maintained on ards-styleventilation while on the ventilator.  he has a bronchoscopy on[12-18] which showed diffuse thick bloody sputum greatest in the rll.  by [12-19] the patient was changed to pressure supportventilation.  the patient was activily diuresed at this time,with good effect and improving respiratory status.  the patienttested negative for legionella and influenza.  the patient wasquickly weaned to cpap+ps of [4-7], but was difficult to weanfully from the vent due mainly to his mental status.   he wasextubated on [12-24] with great success.  on [12-25] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2requirement and a cxr demonstrated a moderate-sized rpneumothorax.  thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chesttube.  this tube was intermittantly to wall-suction, water-sealor clamped.  on [1-2] it was d/c'd, with the pneumothoax smallerin size..#gbm:  head cts compared to his baseline [hospital1 2025] scans showed nointerval change.  he was maintained on his baseline 3mg ofdexamethasone while inpatient here. it appears that neurooncsoriginal plans were to taper the dexamethasone. we were unableto contact primary neuro-oncoligist to discuss steroid taper butthis should be discussed with dr. [last name (stitle) ] when he becomesavailable..#anemia/thrombocytopenia:  had anemia of chronic disease,admitted with thrombocytopenia attributed to avastin andtimador.  his thrombocytopenia was asymptomatic during hishospital course, and steadily improved.  his anemia was mild,and did require occasional transfusion..# hyperglycemia:  intitally hyperglycemic in face of sepsis,controlled with ss insulin and resolved on its own..#r chest wound:  con't to drain purulent material s/p removal ofport.  surgery recommended qid dilute([12-6]) dakin's solution andclose f/u.  any fluctuant areas must be debrided..#mental status:  the patient presented with altered mentalstatus felt to be due to sepsis.  he did take some days toawaken from his intubated and sedated state.  he continued to beaox1-2 in the micu, with symptoms consistent with delerium. arepeat head ct showed no change; his delerium was felt to bemainly post-septic and icu related and appeared to be slowlyintervally improving each day..#prophylaxis: patient was initially on pneumoboots and thenheparin sc, a bowel regmimen and a gi prophlyaxsis throughouthis hospital course..# electrolytes:  the patient required extensive repletion of hispotassium during his icu course, often requiring q6hr lytechecks and 100-200meq of k+ per day.  this was felt to be mostlydue to a diarrhea and thus gi loss, and was resolving at the endof his hospital course as diarrhea resolved..# nutrition:  the patient was maintained on tf while intubated,and also s/p intubation as he failed his initial speech andswallow exams. on [1-3] he passed his speech and swallow bedsidetest..#lfts:  patient had elevated lfts on presentation which wereattributed to sepsis.  this abnormality resolved as thepatient's clinical picture improved.  he should continue onweekly lft checks due to his continuing nafcillin..# pt/ot:  after extubation the patient was followed actively bypt and ot.medications on admission:# naproxen prn# mepron (prophylaxis)# hydrocodone# dexamethasone 3mg# avastin (last received 2wks ago, due on monday [2154-12-16])# lipid lowering [doctor last name 360] (wife unsure of name)# timador (was previously on this, but was stopped [1-4] tothrombocytopenia)discharge medications:1. heparin (porcine) 5,000 unit/ml solution sig: 5000 (5000)units injection tid (3 times a day).2. senna 8.6 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday) as needed.3. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 ml liquid sig: five (5) ml po bid (2times a day).4. atovaquone 750 mg/5 ml suspension sig: seven [age over 90 1230]y(750) mg po bid (2 times a day).5. nystatin 100,000 unit/ml suspension sig: five (5) ml po qid(4 times a day) as needed.6. dexamethasone 1.5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po daily(daily).7. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q6h (every 6hours) as needed.8. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 ml syrup sig: fifteen (15) ml po q6h(every 6 hours) as needed for cough.9. fluconazole 200 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po q24h (every24 hours) for 2 weeks: last day [1-9].10. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po tid (3times a day): hold for hr<50 and sbp<100.11. amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po bid (2 timesa day): [hospital1 ] until [1-7] then 400mg daily.12. famotidine 10 mg/ml solution sig: twenty (20) mg intravenousq12h (every 12 hours).13. ceftriaxone-dextrose (iso-osm) 1 gram/50 ml piggyback sig:one (1) gram intravenous q24h (every 24 hours).14. nafcillin in d2.4w 2 gram/100 ml piggyback sig: two (2)grams intravenous q6h (every 6 hours) for 6 weeks: last day[1-30].15. heparin lock flush (porcine) 100 unit/ml syringe sig: two(2) ml intravenous daily (daily) as needed.16. insulin nph human recomb 100 unit/ml cartridge sig: five (5)units subcutaneous twice a day.17. insulin regular human 300 unit/3 ml insulin pen sig: slidingscale  subcutaneous four times a day: sliding scale.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital3 7] & rehab center - [hospital1 8]discharge diagnosis:primary:septic shockcommunity aquired pneumoniarespiratory failureacute renal failureseptic arthritis (l knee)bacteremiainfected r chest catheterafib with rvrdeleriumanemiathrombocytopeniahyperglycemiapneumothorax (r)hypokalemiatransaminitissecondary:# grade 4 glioblastoma multiforme left temporal lobe;
