skin breakdown, left shift in wbcs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.plan:1.	cellulitis:  despite dm and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  this is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with ancef.  consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  no debridement necessary.  send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  consider mri of le to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.2.	chest pain with bigeminy and pvcs:  rule out for mi by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  monitor ekg and telemetry.  if ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  check lipid panel to further elucidate cad risk, possibly start a statin.3.	deconditioning/sob:  consult pt/ot to assist with
