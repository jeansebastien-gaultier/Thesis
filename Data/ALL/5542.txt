[first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (namepattern1) ]. 40-50cc ofpurulent, bile stained drainage was removed. a large drain wasleft in place and placed to suction. he tolerated this procedurewell. blood cultures and cline tip on [7-7] were negative.cultures were negative until [7-14]. he was relisted for livertransplantation. subsequent cultures grew  enterococcus faeceum.repeat cultures were negative, but then reculture grewenterococcus faeceum and presumed torulopsis glabrata (perid).levaquin was added for additional gram negative coverage.       repeat abd ct showed interval placement of jp drain intothe right lobe of the liver with associated focal subcutaneousair/surgical emphysema. air containing abscess in the right lobesuperior to this appeared to have increased in size.splenomegaly and ascites were again noted. on [7-21], he underwentsuccessful ct-guided pigtail cath placement in enlarging fluidcollection at the junction of segments 8 and 4a.     on [7-29] abd ct revealed 1) s/p multiple drains. confluentbiloma/abscess involving segment [doctor first name ] and viii of the liver, thecomponent in the right lobe is smaller compared to the ct of[2122-7-21].2) small bilateral pleural effusions.3) persisting ascites, predominantly left-sided and partiallyloculated.4) nonvisualized proper hepatic artery, likely occluded. partialsmv occlusion.5) prominent right-sided hydrocele.6) splenomegaly.     abscess cultures persistently grew vre and [female first name (un) ](torulopsis) glabrata. p.     on [7-31]  caspofungin and meropenum was stopped. the 2drains in the left lobe were removed. a repeat ct on [8-3]revealed collection in left lobe and a drain was placed intothis site and 10cc was sent for culture. results are pending.     on [8-6] the capped ptc drain fell out with no adverseeffects. developed diarrhea after tube feed formula changed.stool was sent for c.diff. stool neg on [8-5] and pending for[8-6]     on [8-14] the right liver abscess catheter fell out. thisarea was then loosely packed with normal saline moist gauze [hospital1 ].potassium was consistently running high. a renal consult wasobtained. bactrim and synercid were felt to be contributing tohyperkalemia. bactrim ss was decreased to 3x/week and the tubefeeding was changed back to 1/2 strength nepro. potassiumdecreased within the normal range.     in summary, this hospital course was extremely long andcomplicated. he has remained afebrile for last few weeks.posoconazole, levaquin, synercid will continue. rifaximin is toprevent encephalopathy. bactrim is for pcp [name initial (pre) 2515]. the planis to send [doctor first name ] to [hospital ] rehab hospital with the hope ofbuilding him up nutritionally and increasing his physicalstrength and independence with the hope of keeping him afebrilewhile awaiting re-transplantation of a second liver.  he will befollowed by dr.
