catheterizationhistory of present illness:58 year old male with a pmh of a-fib, osa, pvd secondary to agunshot wound to his right lower leg, and non-ischemiccardiomyopathy with a reported ef of 15-20% in the past and arecent ef of 40%. he had an aicd placed in [5-30], and he has had4 episodes of syncope in the past 2 months. he has been shocked8x in total, with one episode shocking him four timesconsecutively.  his history of cardiomyopathy (best attributedto a possible viral illness, per patient report), dates back 8years.  he has also had long standing a-fib, and it is unclearwhether he had the cardiomyopathy or a-fib first as he has neverbeen symptomatic until [month (only) 205]..he has had 3 hospitalizations for syncope since [2122-5-21]. thefirst of which was [5-24] weekend, when his wife reportswitnessing him lose consciousness for a few seconds and fallingout of a chair.  he was evaluated at [hospital 107] hospital, wasfound to have vt, and had an aicd placed on [2122-5-26]..0n [7-9] he woke up from sleep, his aicd fired and 15 minuteslater it fired again. he was asymptomatic at the time, he wasthen taken to [hospital3 8544] and transferred to [hospital 107]hospital.  he was given a loading dose of amiodarone, andconverted to lower dose because of dizziness.  he was dischargedhome and on [7-17], he was feeding his horses and felt dizzy andlightheaded, fell to the ground had a jerking motion, his familyagain witnessed the event.  he didn't feel like he was shocked,and had no palpitations at the time. he lost consciousness andhis wife was able to get him into the car and take him to thehospital.  he was initially treated for what was thought to beischemic chest pain. at [hospital3 ] they gave him dilaudidfor chest discomfort which caused him to flush and havediaphoresis.  he was transferred to [location (un) 796] and they gave himnitroglycerin, which caused his blood pressure to drop. thisentire course he was kept on  amiodarone of 400mg [hospital1 ]. he hadseveral 6-7 beat runs of nsvt while there and on monday [7-20] hewas intially increased to 400mg tid of amio, then due topersistent episodes of nsvt he was put on iv amio at 1mg/min andtransitioned today to 0.5mg/min..his outpatient cardiologist was concerned for aicd leadmigration and on [7-21] he was taken to the cath lab for leadreplacement. subsequently he developed 20 beats of vt, at whichtime the aforementioned amio drip was started at 1mg/minute.since that time his ekg and tele has shown paced beats andectopy..of note at the osh his creatinine was 1.1, ce negative x 3,electrolytes wnl, vanc ppx for lead placement, coreg wasdecreased to 25 [hospital1 ], coumadin was held, mag oxide added to keepa-fib better controlled. he was continued on digoxin andlisinopril. bps ranged 86-126/46-60..on review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,tia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at thetime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, blackstools or red stools. s/he denies recent fevers, chills orrigors. s/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. all of theother review of systems were negative..cardiac review of systems is notable for syncope, orthopnea(chronic), and lower extremity edema right greater than left, aswell as absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion,

is10-20mmhg. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.the left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. due tosuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormalitycannot be fully excluded. overall left ventricular systolicfunction appears severely depressed (lvef= 20-25 %) but isdifficult to assess due to poor image quality and frequentventricular ectopy. relative preservation of basal inferolateralwall function. there is considerable beat-to-beat variability ofthe left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregularrhythm/premature beats. the right ventricular cavity ismoderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility. theaortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with goodleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. trace aorticregurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets arestructurally normal. there is no mitral valve prolapse. trivialmitral regurgitation is seen. the pulmonary artery systolicpressure could not be determined. there is an anterior spacewhich most likely represents a prominent fat pad..impression: suboptimal image quality. dilated left ventriclewith severe systolic dysfunction. right ventricular dilation

no mitral valve prolapse. trivialmitral regurgitation is seen. there is borderline pulmonaryartery systolic hypertension. there is a trivial/physiologicpericardial effusion.compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [2122-7-22],biventricular systolic cavity sizes are smaller and systolicfunction is slightly improved..brief hospital course:58 year old with a pmh significant for non-ischemiccardiomyopathy, chronic a-fib, and ventricullar tachycardia s/paicd placement on [2122-5-26], that was transferred from [hospital 107]hospital in ri for treatment of ventricular tachycardia withablation..# ventricular tachycardia/dialated cardiomyopathy: mr. [known lastname ] hasventricular tachycardia in the setting of non-ischemiccardiomyopathy.  these episodes of ventricular tachycardiastarted in [2122-5-21], he is s/p aicd placement and has hadseveral instances recently of firing of his aicd.  etiology ofhis v-tach is likely cardiomyopathy resulting in ectopy.  aninitial echo was done the morning after admission and showeddilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, alsoright ventricular dilation and dysfunction. hemodynamicallystable and asymptomatic.  he was conitnued on an amiodarone dripof 0.5mg/min until he was taken for ep procedure on [2122-7-23].during the study, they were beginning to warm a site forablation, and he went into fast vt, so the study was aborted.he converted back to his normal rhythm.  his amiodarone wasconverted to 200mg po tid and he still had vt with walkingminimal distances, therefore loading dose was increased to 400mg[hospital1 ], with plan to transition to 200mg po bid in one week(starting [2122-8-1]).  now currently undergoing workup for hearttransplant.  ct chest completed which showed multifocal smallground-glass nodules predominantly involving the upper lobes,requiring a follow up repeat ct in [2-24] weeks as an outpatient.ct abd/pelvis showed hypoattenuating left upper pole renallesion, most likely benign, but a renal us could be consideredas an outpatient.  hepatitis a,b,c, cmv and hiv serologies werenegative.while on the floor [2122-7-27] and [2122-7-28] he had increased runs ofvtach resulting in aicd firing.  the device fired once on [2122-7-27]at 9:30 in the morning when he was walking with the ep team toreproduce symptoms.  on the 7th, he was washing his hair sittingat the sink and he became symptomatic with lightheadedness andflushing.  he had 2 runs of vtach that both resulted in icdfirings at 8:09 and 8:10 in the morning.  he was taken to cathimmediately following, and then he was taken to the ep lab forreadjustment of his leads.  the lead wires were adjusted toremove slack from the wires.  he tolerated the procedure welland has been without any runs of vtach since.he received a tte on [2122-7-29] when compared with the prior study(images reviewed) of [2122-7-22], biventricular systolic cavitysizes are smaller and systolic function is slightly improved to30-35%. a right/left heart cardiac catheterization that showed:right dominant system that demonstrated no angiongraphicallyapparent disease. the lmca, lad, lcx and rca had no evidence ofangiographically apparent disease. resting hemodyanamicsrevealed slightly elevated right sided filling pressures withrvedp of 15mmhg.  cardiac output was preserved at 7 l/min. hisvolume status was medically managed and he was transitioned backto his home po lasix of 20mg daily..# contact dermatitis/cellulitis: he developed a likely contactdermatitis after lead replacement at osh.  the contactdermatitis may have been from the chlorhexadine prep during theprocedure as the patient reported that this happened in the pastduring a prior cath.  the contact dermatitis likely becamesuper-infected and he developed erispelas which was treatedsuccessfully with doxycyline for 7 days last dose [2122-7-28]..# atrial fibrillation: his atrial fibrillation was ratecontrolled and medically managed.  his coumadin was heldsecondary to need for cardiac catheterization and he was placedon a heparin drip throughout his admission..# sleep apnea: his sleep apnea was medically managed with hiscpap mask at night without complications..the patient was full code for this admission. pt was dischargedhome with further outpt follow-up planned.medications on admission:on transfer from osh:.  coumadin last dose 8/28 for a-fib.  digoxin 0.25mg po q24.  lisinopril 40mg po q24.  coreg 25mg po q12.  mag oxide 400mg po q24.  lovastatin 20mg po q24.  aldactone 12.5mg po q24.  amiodarone 0.5mg/min ivdischarge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:ventricular tachycardianon-ischemic cardiomyopathyacute renal failuredischarge condition:alert and oriented x3independent ambulationdischarge instructions:dear mr. [known lastname ],you were initially admitted to the hospital for loss ofconsciousness, and were found to have an abnormal heart rhythmcalled ventricular tachycardia.  you were transferred to [hospital1 18]for further management of your ventricular tachycardia andevaluation for potential ablation.  unfortunately, the site ofthe abnormal heart rhythm could not be localized for ablation onthis attempt. your pacemaker/defibrillator settings wereadjusted to optimize your own normal heart rhythm andconduction.  you felt significantly improved following theadjustment, and it was decided that your irregular heart rhythmwould be controlled with medications. we required you to stay inthe hospital for a few days  to best optimize your medicationsfor rhythm control.during this hospitalization, we also began the evaluation for aheart transplant in case this is something that might benefityou in the future.other issues on this hospitalization included a rash involvingyour chest, shoulders and neck.  it was believed to be relatedto contact allergy to "chlorhexidine", a cleaning [doctor last name 360] wecommonly use before procedures.  we also believe this skin rashbecame secondarily infected, for which we treated you withantibiotics.the following changes were made to your home medications:- amiodarone was continued at 400mg twice daily for 3 more days,then decrease to 400 mg once daily on [2122-9-2]. please continuethat dose until you see dr. [last name (stitle) ].- start metoprolol succinate to control your ventriculartachycardia- stop taking carvedilol, magnesium and digoxin- decrease the dose of warfarin to 4mg daily. please check yourinr on monday [8-3] with results to dr. [last name (stitle) ].- start taking clindamycin, an antibiotic, to prevent infectionat the icd site- start taking tylenol as needed for pain at the icd site- start taking lorazepam if you need for anxiety or sleep.please weigh yourself every morning, [name8 (md) 138] md if weight goes upmore than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.check your inr at dr.[name (ni) 87185] office on monday [8-3]. you shouldhave the inr followed closely now that you are on amiodarone.please be sure to have your blood drawn at your doctor's officein [11-22] months to check your thyroid and liver function testsbecause amiodarone can sometimes affect these with time. youwill also need to have pulmonary function tests done to makesure the amiodarone is not affecting your lungs.your initial ct scan of your chest here showed that you havesome non-specific nodules that may be due to an infection,inflammatory disease, or even cancer.  please talk to yourprimary care doctor and cardiologist regarding ordering a followup ct of your chest in [2-24] weeks to evaluate whether there isany change.followup instructions:please be sure to keep all of your followup appointments, aslisted below:department: cardiac serviceswhen: monday [2123-1-25] at 1:30 pmwith: dr.
