her pulmonolgist two months ago revealed stable pulmonaryfunction. recent cxrs done at sbh suggest there may be a component ofpulmonary edema , her presentation at this admission not consistent withworsening pulmonary edema from heart failure of valvular disease.an atypical presenation for mi was also ruled out by enzymes.given her acute onset of cough with a fever , the most likely etiology isinfectious exacerbated by her poor pulmonary reserve.=============================================hospital course:--------------1 ) pulmonary: pt kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin despite a
