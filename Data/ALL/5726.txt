septalthickening in both upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, andthe superior and anterior portions of the lower lobes. theopacities are most dense in the upper lobes. small peripheralcentrilobular ground-glass opacities are present throughout bothlower lobes, similar in appearance to [2104-7-16]. while thecentrilobular and confluent ground glass opacities areconsistent with aspiration or pneumonia, presence ofinterstitial septal thickening also suggest pulmonary edema.while there is some nodularity within the opacities, nodularopacities that were seen in the left upper and right lower lobeson [2105-7-16] are no longer present. there is no evidence of anabscess.the trachea, right and left main stem bronchi are mildlydilated. mild-to- moderate bronchiectasis is noted in the upperlobes, right middle lobe and lingula. dependent secretions arenoted in the trachea.there are numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, increasedin number and size compared to

present in bothhila.there are small bilateral pleural effusions. there is nopericardial effusion. scattered atherosclerotic calcificationsare present in the thoracic aorta. mural thrombus is noted inthe proximal abdominal aorta.there is an unchanged ill-defined hypodensity in the right lobeof the thyroid gland, measuring approximately 2 x 1 cm.there is an approximately 4 cm hypodense lesion in the lowerpole of the spleen, unchanged compared to the [2106-2-13] abdominalct, which may represent a splenic infarction. scatteredcalcified granulomas are again noted in the liver. stones areagain seen in the gallbladder. surgical clips are again noted inthe porta hepatis and in the region of the gastroesophagealjunction. the imaged portions of the pancreas, adrenal glands,and kidneys appear unremarkable. the imaged bones appearunremarkable.impression:1. diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacities, confluent in the upperand middle lobes, consistent with aspiration or pneumonia.recurrent

excluded.there is a hepatic granuloma within the dome of the liver. noconcerning hepatic lesions. there are multiple small gallstonesdependently within the gallbladder. no gallbladder wallthickening.

without enhancement measuring 4.4 x 4.3 x 3.9cm that has significantly increased since the [5-7] study. thereis an adjacent smaller similar- appearing lesion lateral to thislarger lesion. these are nonspecific but considerations wouldinclude a splenic infarct. there is no stranding around theselesions, however infection of the lesions cannot be excluded.small splenic hemangioma is also again noted unchanged.the pancreas is normal in appearance. the patient has undergonegastric bypass with a gastrojejunostomy. adrenal glands arenormal in appearance. no bowel wall thickening. no evidence ofbowel wall thickening or bowel obstruction. the appendixcontains contrast within it and gas, possibly from prior ctscan. no evidence for appendicitis. small amount of fluid withinthe right lower

butconsiderations would include embolic phenomenon such ascholesterol or other emboli. of note, there is a large calcifiedplaque within the right renal artery just beyond its origin withat least moderate narrowing of the right renal artery. there isalso moderate narrowing of the left renal artery at its origin.there are multiple cysts within the kidneys bilaterally. thereare multiple hypoattenuating lesions which are too small tocharacterize but likely cysts.no lymphadenopathy or ascites.ct pelvis without and with iv contrast:the urinary bladder has a foley catheter within it and isincompletely distended. no definite urinary bladder abnormality.there is a small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. bowelwithin the pelvis is within normal limits. there is a rectaltube with

diffuse atherosclerotic plaque within the aorta with alarge amount of plaque within the infrarenal aorta. there is anulcerated plaque within the infrarenal aorta with a small neck.this does not extend beyond the normal contour of the aorta. theleft common iliac artery is occluded, as before. there isreconstitution of the left external iliac artery from retrogradeflow and there is minimal flow

right commoniliac artery distally and the external iliac artery is occludedwith an old stent in place. the iliac-femoral graft is widelypatent. just distal to its insertion within the right

contains gas within it, likely from recent surgery.bilateral superficial femoral arteries are patent proximallythough diminutive. there are small fluid collections aboutbilateral common femoral arteries near the graftorigin/insertions, both of which contain small amounts of gas,likely related to recent surgery. just distal to the insertionsite of the femoral-femoral bypass graft on the left is a roundfluid collection that on pre-contrast images is heterogeneous indensity and post-contrast images shows a small amount ofcontrast outside the lumen of the adjacent arteries withprogressive increased density dependently within the collectionseen, making this highly suspicious for a pseudoaneurysm. thisis best demonstrated on series 2, 3, and 4, images 90-94 andseries 6 b, images 186-189. the arteries distal to the graftsites are patent within the visualized portions.sma, [female first name (un) 899], and celiac artery are all patent and without evidenceof proximal stenoses. as
