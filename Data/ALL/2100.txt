:08/05/97discharge date :08/19/97principal diagnosis :acute myocardial infarction .associated diagnosis :urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .history of present illness :the patient presented to ph university of medical center with a fever .the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .he reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his parkinson &apos;s disease .his wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .they went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to ph university of medical center for admission .he was recently started on a texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .he has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .past medical history :as above .medications ; on admission were eldepryl , artane , prilodol , sinemet and opuputine .allergies :he had no known drug allergies .hospital course and treatment :the patient was admitted and started on ampingent intravenously .there was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .he was continued on his parkinson &apos;s medications .a head ct was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .head ct results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .dr. factor agreed he would review the cts and follow the patient while in house .he was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .he was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .the patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full arnsperni health services .bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .he did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .thus , he was considered ready for discharge .he again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .he again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .he was switched over the clinda and gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .on 8/10/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit .he was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .he was hypotensive into the 80s .an electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased st segment and left anterior st depressions .rv leads were negative for st elevation .a chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .a portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .he had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .the right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .he was transferred to the intensive care unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .the patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .he was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .he was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on dobutamine for pressure support .he was diuresed with lasix and diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .he surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .he was dynamically stable on his dobutamine with improved oxygenation .the patient continued fairly stable while intubated .two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of dobutamine .he had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .his neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .they were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .an echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .they did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .the repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .the lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .he was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .the patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .no further blood draws were done .the patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .comfort measures continued until the day 8/19/97 , where mr. koteleebdils was found to be pulseless , without respirations .he was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on 8/19/97 .the family and the attending physician were notified .laure mediate , m.d.tr :lwdd
