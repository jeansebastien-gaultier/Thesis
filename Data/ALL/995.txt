, date of surgery 3/25/05. preoperativediagnosis , aortic stenosis. postoperative diagnosis aorticstenosis. procedure aortic valve replacement with a #21carpentier-edwards magna valve. bypass time was 59 minutes ,cross clamp time was 48 minutes. two atrial wires , oneventricular wire , one pericardial tube , one retrosternal tubereplaced. findings , heavily calcified trileaflet aortic valve.weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass , she was in complete heartblock. a wires and v wires were placed. after the operation ,the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit instable condition. while in the cardiac intensive care unit , hercourse was complicated by complete heart block immediatelyfollowing surgery. at that time , she had to be paced anddeveloped a junctional rhythm in the 30s. on postoperative day#2 , she was in sinus rhythm in the 70's with occasionally pacedbeats. at that time patient was started on no nodal agents ofany kind. also , while in the cardiac intensive care unit , it wasfound that she had a low hematocrit and was given 1 unit ofpacked red blood cells and her hematocrit has been stable since.on postoperative day 2 , the patient was transferred to thecardiac step-down unit. while on the cardiac step-down unit ,course was complicated by the following: as stated previously ,the patient was on no nodal blockers upon transfer. shedeveloped rapid atrial fibrillation on postoperative day 3 withheart rates between 100 and 120. because her epicardial pacingwires were functioning appropriately , it was felt that patientwould benefit from a beta-blocker. lopressor was started and thepatient tolerated this dose of beta-blocker without anybradycardiac episodes. however , patient continued in and out ofatrial fibrillation for the next two days. on postoperative day5 , she was started on diltiazem drip. once the drip wasimplemented , she was she converted to normal sinus rhythm. whenthe diltiazem drip was discontinued and her beta-blocker wascontinued , the patient as of today discharge has been in normalsinus rhythm for greater than 48 hours. of note , patient wassubtherapeutic on her inr prior to discharge. her inr will beclosely followed by greenau healt hospital anticoagulationclinic.discharge medications:she was discharged home in stable condition on the followingmedications: tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. pain

b.i.d. ,atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day , coumadin of which she willreceive 3 mg today.plan:as stated previously , patient is on coumadin for her rapid atrialfibrillation. goal inr is 2-3. please draw her inr on 11/28/05and then daily until therapeutic. onland medical centeranticoagulation clinic will be following her inr. the phonenumber is 915-360-5305. the patient is to follow up with dr.swinger , cardiac surgeon in six weeks and dr. pfeiffer cardiologistin two weeks.escription document: 3-9154671 emsdictated by: tisi , jamaalattending: jacquez , denisdictation id 1024684d: 6/18/05t: 6/18/05
