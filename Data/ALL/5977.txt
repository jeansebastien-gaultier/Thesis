differential diagnosis includes cap (typicals andatypicals), pcp (multiple hiv risk factors), aspirationpneumonia (given history of narcotic overuse), malignancy(lymphoma, testicular ca, other), or tb. the patient was broadlycovered with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl, and vancomycin.a ct was obtained [2119-1-24] that showed diffuse centrilobularopacities and apical ground glass attenuation with bilateralaxillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. the patient'seosinophils rose to 13%, raising concern for hypersensitivitypneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, or bronchopulmonaryaspergillosis. legionella urinary antigen and hiv ab tests werenegative. ldh was elevated, which could be suggestive of pcp orlymphoma. pcp smear was negative x1 and sputum cultures grewonly oropharyngeal flora. pulmonary and thoracic surgery wereconsulted, and the patient underwent vats on [2119-1-26] withbiopsies of left upper and lower lung and left axillary lymphnode. a ppd was placed, and was negative. anca and rf werenegative.the patient developed worsening hypoxia and shortness of breathand required a micu stay, though no intubation. he was startedon iv steroids for his lymphadenopathy and worsening pneumonia.he was also continued on his vanco, ctx, and azithromycin. hehad a ct scan to look for a pe and this found large b/lateralpulmonary emboli. a heparin gtt was started. in this ct scan, itwas also noted that his infiltrates and lymphadenopathyimproved, so steroids, abx were also continued. the patientimproved his oxygen saturations and breathing and wastransferred back to the floor. his chest tube had been removedwithout complication, including no pneumothorax, while he was inthe micu and 2 nylon sutures were removed from the site on[1-31].after coming back to the floor, the patient did well and was onroom air at discharge. his cultures from a bal were all negativeand after discussion with pulmonary team antibiotics werediscontinued after 9 days of vanc, ctx, azithro. he was afebrileand his wbc was elevated (thought to be related to high dosesteroids). diff was normal.--tapering ccsthis vats pathology came back and demonstrated 2 discretemorphologies affecting upper and lower lobes. in the upperlobes, the process appeared to be infiltrative dz of thealveoli, while lower lungs demonstrated bronchiocentricinflammation. path was read as acute organizing pna withneutrophilic predominence, likley viral/bacterial etiology. pt'ssteroids were tapered down to 20 mg qd, which he will cont for 3days, then will switch to 10mg qd for 5 days and then off. hewill follow-up in pulmonary clinic on [3-6].2) chest wall hematoma- pt c/o pain over ln bx site with tendermass and expansion over a 24hr period. u/s showed hematoma. hisanticoagulation proceeded cautiously with heparin (goal ptt50-70). his hct remained stable and there was no significantexpansion of the lesion, so he was bridged to coumadin (goal inr[3-9]). thoracics recommended supportive and preventiveinterventions including elevation of the arm, rom training,radial pulses, warm compresses, but felt there was no need toevacuate the hematoma. ...pt may need ivc filter if conts toexpand while on anticoags pt c/o of pain over the bx site. painwas well controlled with iv dilaudid.2) chronic pain syndrome/le neuropathy/le ulcers: the patientwas maintained on ms contin, hydromorphone, neurontin, flexeril.his ulcers appeared noninfected and superficial while thepatient was in the hospital. these are chronic.3) gi: the patient was continued on protonix throughout hishospital course for gerd. hepbsag and sab were negative, hcv andhepb&c ab were pending on discharge. patient's lfts were normal.4) hypothyroidism: although the patient has no previousdiagnosis of hyporthyroidism, tsh 11 and free t4 0.7.levothyroxine 50 mcg po daily was initiated. the patient willrequire follow-up tsh within 6 weeks following discharge.5) diabetes: the patient's fingersticks were very elevated afterstarting on iv steroids. he was started on insulin and thenrequired some long acting for severe hyperglycemia. the patienthad a hgb a1c of 7.1. his glucose should come down as hissteroids are tapered but he will have to be followed closely. hewas maintained on riss with qid fingersticks while in-house, but#######6) pes: patient had bilateral pes as discussed above. he wasstarted on heparin gtt and bridged to coumadin once his chestwall hematoma was stable. bilateral lenis were negative for dvtand echo showed #####7) dispo: pt will be going home with services, rather than torehab,as he has used up all of his [hospital 103876] rehab days.prior to dispo, pt's pcp was updated on [hospital ] hospital course andneed for close follow-up care.medications on admission:meds on
