thestent.3. right vocal cord paralysis, with or without tumorinvolvement. correlationwith direct visualization is recommended.4. linear air-filled structure extending to the right ofmidline, originatingfrom the esophagus, possibly representing an esophagealdiverticulum.5. lytic lesions in vertebral bodies c2 and c3, present on priorpet withoutabnormal fdg uptake. while these findings may

right internal jugular vein but apparentlyrelated tomass effect or invasion rather than thrombosis.brief hospital course:# respiratory failure/methemeglobinemia:  the patient wasintubated with sats in the high 90s after methylene blue.  abgsshowed improving trend.  methemeglobinemia likely over at pointof transfer to micu.  weaned off vent to cpap and was extubatedin the afternoon on [9-2] by the pulmonary team.  cardiac enzymeswere trended and were stable.  reglan was held. toxicologyfollowed during stay in micu and methylene blue was redosed..# thyroid & esphageal carcinoma: intent of care remainedpalliative during this admission. chemoradiation was deemed tonot have made a significant impact on the patient's symptoms,which continue to be cough, difficulty breathing / talking, anddysphagia. the decision was made to stop further chemotherapyand pursue potential surgical avenues for further palliation. anumber of medication changes were also made, including startingmirtazapine for appetite stimulation per palliative care, andacetylcysteine and codeine/guiafenesin to promote productivecoughing..# transient hypotension: the patient developed transienthypotension in the setting of propofol boluses, diarrhea.hypovolemia also possible given sinus tach.  blood pressurenormalized with fluid boluses and in the absence of fever orleukocytosis, sepsis was deemed unlikely and empiric vanc/zosynwas discontinued..# arf: recent elevation this month in the setting of new chemo,possibly prerenal from chemo associated diarrhea. cr remainedstable at 1.2; the patient was discharge with cr 1.1.# hyponatremia: hypovolemic hyponatremia normalized from 132 to139 upon discharge with volume resuscitation.medications on admission:fibersource hn  liquid
