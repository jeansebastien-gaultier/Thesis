metastases from colon cancer .associated diagnosis :1. colon cancer ,2. disseminated intravascular coagulopathy .special procedures and operations :1. on 7-28-94 , right trisegmentectomy ( hepatic resection ) .additional procedures :1. on 7-29-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,2. on 7-29-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .history of present illness :the patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to dr. duhenile for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .the patient initially presented in september of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .she subsequently underwent a right colectomy in september of 1992 for a duke 's c-ii moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .she subsequently recent adjuvant 5-fu and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in september of 1993 .in thanksgiving of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in february of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in april of 1994 .a computerized tomography scan obtained in april of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .after two additional cycles of 5-fu and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .the computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .prior to surgery , the patient was taken to vascular radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .these demonstrated1. portal vein patent ,2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .the patient was subsequently brought to the operating room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .the operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .the left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .the intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .the patient received 21 liters of lactated ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .there were 5300 cc given via the cellsaver .the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit .however , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .the decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .the patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .the operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .the patient was returned again to the surgical intensive care unit .however , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .the patient required blood pressure support with pressors .due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .the patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .the abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the surgical intensive care unit .however , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .the patient continued to require transfusions .the patient 's oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest x-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .the ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .the urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with lasix and mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .as the patient 's hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .the study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94 .at this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off .condition on discharge :the patient expired
