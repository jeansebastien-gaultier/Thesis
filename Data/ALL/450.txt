record date: 2086-10-19                                              10-19-86   this patient was seen with dr. nabor jacoby. history of present illness:  this is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and obesity.  her problems are as follows: 1.   diabetes.  she was sent to me from ob/gyn because of her high glucose      and she was put on insulin by me.  xitlali xia followed her in      order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as      she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.       she finally comes back and i am relieved, but she has not brought any      list of her blood sugars.  she says she does take them about twice a      day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and      threw them away.  she says that they never go higher than 200; that      they usually are about 110.  it was 101 this morning before      breakfast, she says.  she says it does get as low as 19 and five or      six times it has been below 50.  she does say she eats three regular      meals but then later in the morning when i asked her if she had eaten      breakfast she said no.  she is seeing a nutritionist this morning.      i will check a hemoglobin a1c today.  i expressed to her again how      important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.       she had been eating a lot of chocolate.  she says she has gotten off      of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it      then.  she is going to a nutritionist today and i hope that she will      help her with her diet.  if her diet does get better, maybe we can      wean her off the insulin and try micronase.  i explained to her, too,      that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might      be able to get her off the insulin.  this seemed to be something that      she would like to do.  hopefully the nutritionist can help.  i also      told her that in order to find out what was going on that i need her      to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep,      and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was      really going on and whether they are getting too low.  she denies any      kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  i am      wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.       she had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no      nothing.  she felt totally normal.  so hopefully she will really      record these and we will get a better idea.  she said this always      happens in the morning.  she kept contradicting herself and had no      documentation.  i went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.       once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  she does drink juice,      but i went over the symptoms again with her.  she will call me if she      does have any.                                              10-19-86   2.   left ankle pain.  i sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.       she said that she may do some surgery on her. 3.   dysuria.  she says this is totally resolved after giving her the      bactrim. 4.   yeast infection.  she said this has also resolved. 5.   she complains of headache.  she says these have been going on for two      or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.       she has had nausea and vomited once.  this happened pretty much every      day and it can be at any time of the day.  tylenol and advil did not      help.  she knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in      the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.       but she has no further prodrome.  she says it is a banging kind of      pain that is rhythmic.  she also says she does see stars in front of      her eyes when it happens.  i asked her if she had any hearing loss,      and she said that she hears voices but people are not there      sometimes.  it has been happening for a couple of weeks.  i discussed      this with dr. jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like      migraines.  i will not image her head now as there is no evidence      that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  her neuro exam      was totally normal.  cranial nerves ii-xii were checked and intact.       her gait was normal.  light touch was touched.  her toes were      downgoing.  her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  her disks were      sharp.  eomi, perrl.  i gave her a prescription for motrin, 600 mg po      t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind      her left ear.  i will see her in a week and a half to reassess this. 6.   health maintenance.  i thought that since she is diabetic and obese      that she might benefit from a flu shot.  she has no interest in this      at all.  her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh      cuff.  her pulse was 96.  her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was      285.    _________________________xitlali crane, m.d. ccl:fg:1879dd:10-19-86dt:10-21-86dv:10-19-86  approved but not reviewed by attending provider
