(503 155-7742)psych:  brittany prince, m.d.contact:  mother, haley vaughn (158 857-4114)source:   patient; m.d. passoff; previous medical recordsprecautions:   mrsa; vreprimary service:  psychiatry service (internal medicine)consult date:   6/19/77time:   2:00 pmcc:  suicidal ideationreason for consult:  evaluation for history of medical problemshpi:  pt is a 33 y.o. male with htn, iddm2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for fournier&#8217;s gangrene at manamana, and depression, who was transferred to the manamana psychiatry by his mediquik psychiatrist, dr. prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  dr. prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and ems, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  however, per mr. vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  dr. prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  he reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  given concern for imminent danger, a section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the manamana ed.  the pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  however, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.the medical service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a psychiatry service. pmh/psh1. depression:  symptoms since age 12.2. iddm2:  diagnosed at age 18.  was previously on oral hypoglycemics, but now on insulin.  when pt had lost weight and down to 210 lbs, he did not require insulin.  last hgb a1c of 11.3 in december 2076.3. microalbuminuria: microalbumin of 286mg/dl (12/20/76) and malb/cre ratio of 4133.  pt was previously taking lisinopril 40mg daily and losartan 25mg daily, but is not taking an ace-inhibitor or arb currently.4. hyperlipidemia:  primarily hypertriglyceridemia.  tg as high as 3060 on 6/20/76 in setting of poorly controlled dm2.  last tg of 346 on 2/13/77.  pt was previously on fenofibrate 145mg daily, but is not taking it currently.5. htn:  on toprol xl.6. fournier&#8217;s gangrene:  pt presented to educare-pullman clinic on 1/21/77 with buttock pain and folliculitis that did not improve on oral antibiotics.  subsequent scrotal pain, swelling, and found to have fournier&#8217;s gangrene requiring surgical debridement at manamana on 2/01/77.  pt had prolonged hospitalization with icu course, multiple wound closures, diverting colostomy, and extended iv antibiotic course.  pt was discharged on 3/12/77 with sacral and scrotal wounds improving, but not fully healed.  he has been followed closely by manamana surgery with significant improvements.7. s/p diverting colostomy: s/p diverting colostomy on 2/6/77 in setting of recovery following fournier&#8217;s gangrene.  on 6/9/77, pt underwent dilatation of the skin surrounding the colostomy site, to relieve a large bowel obstruction.8. obesity:  currently weighs 298 lbs.9. migraine headaches10. s/p cholecystectomy in 2065medications: (confirmed with pt)1. toprol xl    100mg     po   once daily2. nph insulin  30units   sc   qam with breakfast3. nph insulin  10units   sc   qpm with dinner4. regular insulin sliding scale  sc  qac + qhs- for fs of 130-170, give 2units - for fs of 171-200, give 4units - for fs of 201-250, give 6units - for fs greater than 250, give 10units 5. celexa       60mg      po   once daily (stopped taking 2 weeks ago)6. klonopin      1mg      po   once daily  prn for anxiety (last dose was 3 days ago)7. mvi           1tablet  po   once daily8. zinc supplementsallergies:  hctz -&gt;

hospitalization for fournier&#8217;s gangrene at manamana, and depression, who was transferred to the manamana psychiatry by his mediquik psychiatrist, dr. prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  pt does have hypertension, iddm2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  all of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (hctz caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ace-i or arb.  his history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for dm2 and improved glycemic control.  he would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as lopid.  his dm2 is quite stable, as pt reports fs of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  the wounds should be evaluated by his surgical team through his outpatient appointments.  his last evaluation by general surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of bid dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.recommendations:1. continue toprol xl 100mg po once daily2. continue nph insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  if pt is npo, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose3. continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the medication list with qac and qhs fingerstick checks4. no concentrated sweets diet5. start lisinopril 10mg po once daily6. start lopid 600mg po bid (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)7. consider checking hemoglobin a1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of ldl for triglyceridemia8. dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds tid and prn if dressing is soaked9. will defer antidepressive medication regimen to psychiatry servicecase and plan discussed in detail with medical consult attending, dr. hector bennett.  _____________________________ulysses jurado, m.d.   pager #34621manamana medical sar
