a herd of elephants on my chest.    hpi: 	69 yo f with pmh of dm, htn, s/p mi one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days.  patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.  this pain was constant,    24 hours/day   , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.     this was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.  the chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    i felt like i was about to faint.     patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.  the pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called ems.  upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of sl nitro which improved her pain.  in the tpg ed her vital signs were temp af, hr 70, bp 154/79, rr 20, satting 99% ra.  ekg showed a new twave inversion in v3, otherwise at her baseline normal ekg.  iv heparin was started for possible mi given her symptoms and history.  d-dimer was elevated at 782. based on these findings and her shortness of breath, pe-ct was obtained, which was negative for pe.  however, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the lll.  the patient was given asa, mso4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ed.  she was admitted for continued rule out for mi and workup of her pulmonary findings.  ros:  no fevers/chills. does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.  the patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, no hematochezia/melena. no increased frequency, no dysuria. no delta ms/loc. past medical history:cad-s/p mi, although unclear when this occurred.  ett 2092:  nondiagnostic for ischemia. no evidence of scar or ischemia.  nonspecific apical thinning.hx tb-patient says she was diagnosed at age 19, received drug therapy and spent time in a sanatorium.  says ppd is always positive, needs cxr to diagnose.  hypertension elevated

18:17radiologychest ct:  4/11/96	no gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to	suggest pulmonary embolism.  there are several mediastinal lymph	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size.  however, in the	region of the ap window there are numerous ap window lymph nodes	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis.  these could be	reactive or neoplastic.  there is a less than 1 cm left hilar	node.  in the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm	parenchymal nodule. this is best demonstrated on image 65. this	could possibly represent a malignancy.  alternatively this could	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node.  this does not appear to	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less	likely.  some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial	right lung base.  there is no pneumothorax.  no significant	pleural fluid is noted.  there is no pericardial fluid.impression:	no pulmonary embolism or dvt.  there are multiple mediastinal	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.	neoplasm cannot be excluded.  a follow-up chest ct may be further	value.  these findings were discussed with dr. hendricks at the time	of dictation.ekg:  nsr, compared to prior there is new flipped t wave in iii, however no st/t wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.a/p:pt is a 69 yo f with pmh notable for dm, htn, peripheral neuropathy and s/p mi with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest x-rays.  this constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of mi and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in ab ct and chest ct, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of tb infection and treatment.  i believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an mi, has little to no ischemic changes on ekg, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.  workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out tb, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.cv:--rate:  well controlled without medication. --rhythm:  normal sinus--pump:  on acei, hctz for htn.  --ischemia:  on
