:stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .principal procedure :4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .history of present illness :mr. no is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at noughwell entanbon health in stoningi , kansas .this involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .he did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .he underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by dr. g hemp .following this , he was followed closely by dr. brown in na .over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by dr. brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .he also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .the patient was referred here for further evaluation .mr. no suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .physical examination :on physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .the blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .there were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .there was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .the cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .there was a grade ii / vi systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .the liver was not palpable .there were diminished pulses in the legs .laboratory data :the hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 meq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , bun and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .the electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific st-t wave changes .the chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .hospital course :i indicated to dr. brown that i had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .accordingly , on april 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .the study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .the right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .the left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .an attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .on april 8 , 1993 , dr. g hemp performed open heart surgery .at the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .there was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .i have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .the valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .the surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .mr. no was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .he had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .he seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .there was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .the patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .the heart appeared to be flaccid .we really have no good explanation of what this was all about .he was being treated for a possible pneumonia .he did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .the patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .a post mortem examination will be performed .taarnna lanceloilneg , m.d.tr :ra / bmotdd :4-14-93td :04/15/93cc :dr. shajen
