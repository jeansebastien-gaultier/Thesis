): luke ollie buckley .hospital course by problems:1. paroxysmal hypertension/tachycardia: this was in the settingof not taking her toprol. she does have a history of labileblood pressure and difficult to control hypertension. thissymptom was thought to look very much like pheochromocytoma , butthis was ruled out last admission. renal artery stenosis wasalso ruled out last admission. given the description and thefact that she had elevated plasma metanephrines on the previousadmission , one possible diagnosis that was considered with pseudopheochromocytoma. studies for pheochromocytoma , pseudopheochromocytoma , carcinoid , and hypothyroidism ( including24-hour urine metanephrines were sent ) these all returned asnegative. her tsh was normal. she was initially put on q.i.d.lopressor and hydralazine. the hydralazine was then discontinueddue to hypotension. her lopressor was changed to toprol-xl , thiswas also discontinued for hypotension. her ultimate regimen wastitrated based on

she was well controlled and asymptomaticupon discharge.2. ischemia: she was initially ruled out for mi. her mibishowed reversible ischemia unchanged from 2002 despite twocatheterizations in intervening time. she was seen by lmhcardiology , and this defect was felt to be nonintervenable. shewas discharged home in stable condition and chest pain free.3. dizziness/nausea: she had episodes of this during herhospitalization. it was of unclear etiology and she has had aprevious significant prior workup ( see previous dischargesummary ). she received p.r.n. meclizine and compazine and wasdischarged home without any dizziness or nausea.4. calcium: she had borderline high calcium and a pth was sentand returned mildly elevated. this will need to be followed upas an outpatient.discharge condition:stable.to do plan:further workup for question of elevated pth in the setting ofhigh calcium suggestive of hyperparathyroidism.discharge medications:1. aspirin 81 mg p.o.
