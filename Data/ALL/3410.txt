chart]85f hx chf, copd, dm2, htn, pvd (s/p mult procedures) p/w acute sob this am. pt reports she has had a bladder infection off and on for the past several months manifesting as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria. went to wgh pecos clinic 1 wk pta and received fosfamycin. went back on tue w no resolution of sx and says med was changed (? to nitrofurantoin per ed pass-off). on friday am, woke up with sob. felt bloated in her stomach and had difficulty w breathing when trying to get dressed. sob much worse w activity, would resolve w lying down, associated w diaphoresis. pt denies cp at the time of the episode (reports some subsequent short-lived r-sided cp in wgh ed, similar to r-sided cp she has had    off and on for awhile    wh she did not mention to the ed staff). denies palpitations, arm or jaw pain. denies increase in le edema, no recent change in meds, excellent medication regimen compliance, not a lot of salt in diet, and no recent diet changes. pt does sleep on mult pillows but says she does this because of her reflux disease. pt does think she had similar sob 1-2  yrs ago when she was admitted to wgh, told she had chf, and was diuresed. because of her symptoms on friday 12/09/88, pt went into wgh pecos clinic. per pecos note, ekg at that time showed st depressions in i,avl, v5, v6, ii/iii/avf. pt received asa 325 and lasix 40 mg iv, and was sent to wgh ed.ed course: on arrival to wgh ed, pt had vs t 98.2, p 74, bp 160/70, rr 24, o2 sat 95% ra. pt's ekg was read as showing st depressions in v4-v6. pt received ntg sl x 1, lopressor iv 5 mg x1, lopressor 25 mg po x1, and reportedly ekg changes improved w rate control. cxr in ed was clear. bnp was in 1400s (vs 6000-12000 during prior wgh admissions where chf was diagnosed).ros:   no f/c. some

likely multifactorial from chf and copd, copd exacerbated by recent illness is most likely etiology.  chf is argued against by: normal bnp (especially in comparison to elevated bnp in 6000s on prior admission for chf), clear cxr, clear lung exam, and pt is still having exertional cp similar to what she felt on am of admission.  if one believes her ekgs demonstrated ischemic changes, this would support an explanation that her sob is an anginal equivalent. however, st changes appear minimal on close evaluation of ekg changes. cardiac enzymes are negative so far.plan: 1.	soba.	cont to cycle
