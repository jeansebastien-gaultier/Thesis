not finalizedbrief hospital course:# apnea/hypoxia: the patient experienced apnea in the immediatepost-operative period following debridement of a trachealnodule. the apnea was thought to be attributed to paralytics,which warranted intubation. when the paralytic agents wore off,the patient was extubated, but remained hypoxia. the prolongedhypoxia post-operatively was attributed to aspirationpneumonitis likely with an element of post-operativeinflammation from the procedure itself. the patient remainedrhoncorous with course upper airway breath sounds throughout thehospitalization. cxr ruled out pna as a potentialy source ofhypoxia, and the patient did not produce significant volumes ofconcentration of blood in the sputum concerning for trachealbleed. other possibilities include worsening of underlying lungcancer which is unlikely to explain acute hypoxia. the patientwas eventually transitioned to high flow face mask, followed byhigh-flow face tent, followed by nasal cannular on 4l. thepatient was weaned without event from 4l to 2l nasal cannula andtransferred to the inpatient medical floor, where she continuedsat'ing ~94% on 2l. nebs were administered on an as needed basisthroughout the duration of hospitalization, and were found to behelpful in terms of coughing up phlegm.the patient was taken off supplemental oxygen the following dayand sat'ed within her normal baseline range 88-92% on room airwithout any problems at rest. however, patient desaturated withphysical therapy during activity. they recommended home oxygen(2l with activity)when ambulating with a walker. the patientwill be discharged with home oxygen as well as vna services..# hct drop: the patient presented with a hct 44.7 and found tohave a hct of 33.1 post-operatively. the low hct is most likelyattributable to fluids received during procedure and minimalblood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values werefollowed and the hct level was stable and began to rise withoutevent or concern for chonic blood loss. hct 34.0->35.8 this am..# non-small cell lung ca: a new tracheal mass identified on ctin [month (only) ] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely togrow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement waswarranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperativecomplications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above.the patient is now pod#2 s/p debridment by ip. biopsy resultsare pending. she is followed by interventional pulmonology forcontinued management..# goals of care: discussed code
