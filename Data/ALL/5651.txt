record date: 2092-12-15name:    wilson, gabrielmrn:       8514931the patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up. she has been havingsymptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that i cannot get aclear history of her symptoms. at times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she mightfall over to her right side. there is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or othersymptoms. she has not actually had syncope. there is no positional component to hersymptoms. i had scheduled her for an mra/mri to evaluate those symptoms. themri does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrumovale and bilateral pontine region. she had small chronic lacunar infarcts. she reportsthat she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain whichwould not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. she had some left internal carotidmild 30% proximal stenosis. her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  physical exam:  small lacunar infarcts. most likely related to hypertension ratherthan embolic disease. her blood pressure has been very well controlled. in fact, todayon exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. she brought her medications with her andhas been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day andhydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. she had not taken her medications today andher blood pressure here when i repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 inthe left. her neck is supple without jvd or bruits. her lungs are clear withoutwheezes, rales or rhonchi. her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normals1, s2.        assessment and plan:   history of hypertension. now with lower bloodpressure and some lightheadedness. we will d/c her atenolol. i would like her to get arepeat blood pressure in one week. i discussed her mri/mra findings with her.long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and herdiabetes. she will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.    julie fraser, m.d.jf/crane/powell
