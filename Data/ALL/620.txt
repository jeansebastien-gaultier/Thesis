:unsignedadmission date :            8-29-94discharge date :            9-21-94principal diagnosis :end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .associated diagnosis :1. diverticulitis ,2. perforated cecum ,3. acute renal insufficiency .special procedures and operations :a heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on 8-29-94 .other procedures :1. colonoscopy on 9-5-94 ,2. colonoscopy with rectal tube placement on 9-7-94 ,3. subtotal colectomy with hartman pouch and ileostomy on 9-10-94 ,4. renal biopsy on 9-13-94 .history of present illness :the patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .he started on dialysis in 03/92 and has been maintained on it since .he is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .the patient is admitted for renal transplantation .past surgical history :the patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .past medical history :1. hypertension ,2. difficulty hearing ,3. gout ,4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .medications on admission :nephrocaps , 1 q.day , colace 1 q.day , allopurinol 100 q.day , verapamil 240 mg q.day , niferex 150 mg po b.i.d. , colchicine 0.6 mg po q.day , phoslo 667 mg q.day , cardura 1 mg po q.day .allergies :the patient has no known drug allergies .review of systems :the review of systems was negative .physical examination :the physical examination was unremarkable .pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the hospital on 9-8-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the exwagh9t protocol .his operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .he then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .during this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .an x-ray at the time revealed free air .the patient was therefore brought to the operating room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .he was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .he therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .the subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .the patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .a renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .it was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .with just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .at the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .the patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .it is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .he ruled out for myocardial infarction .an echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .a holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .the patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , propanolol , and verapamil .again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .he did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .medications on discharge :prednisone 20 mg po q.day , imuran 25 mg po q.day , acyclovir 200 mg po t.i.d. , bactrim one single strength po qhs , maalox 15 cc po b.i.d. , zantac 150 mg po b.i.d. , verapamil 80 mg po t.i.d. , lasix 40 mg po b.i.d. , cardura 4 mg po b.i.d. , cyclosporin 300 mg po b.i.d. , digoxin 0.125 mg po q.day , clotrimazole 10 mg po b.i.d.
