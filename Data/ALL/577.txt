:unsignedadmission date :            11-8-93discharge date :            11-18-93principal diagnosis :craniopharyngioma of left petrous bone , cerebellar pontine angle and parasellar region .special procedures and operations :            11-8-93 , left frontotemporal craniotomy with subtotal removal of craniopharyngioma .history of present illness :the patient is a 52 year old right hand dominant white female who presented with recurrent tumor in the left cp angle and middle fossa .she is followed by dr. brendniungand fossa and dr. telshey swatlleebtik .past medical history :her past medical history is unremarkable until 1977 when she developed left eye and face pain , accompanied by numbness .a computerized tomography scan was felt to be normal .in 1989 , she started developing incoordination in her left upper extremity .a magnetic resonance imaging study at that time revealed a left cpa tumor with pontine compression .this tumor was partially resected in 08/89 with nondiagnostic pathology , finally labeled as a hamartoma .she was followed with serial imaging studies .she had developed increasing tumor growth and increasing symptoms over the past three months , consisting of decreased ambulation , frequent falls and unable to get up the stairs of a bus due to proximal weakness .she also noticed loss of balance .in 05/93 , she had a magnetic resonance imaging study that revealed a large complex extra-axial mass centered in the left cpa with marked mass effect on the brainstem , left temporal lobe and the left parapharyngial space .there was no change compared with a previous study of 12/92 .review of systems :the review of systems was positive for an injury to the right third finger with a soiled razor blade .wound was clean .no tetanus shot had been received .family history :the family history is negative for brain tumor or neurologic disease .social history :the patient is a retired airline worker , 35 pack year smoking history , no alcohol use .allergies :the patient has no known drug allergies .medications on admission :tegretol 200 mg po t.i.d. , medrol taper begun on the 9th .physical examination :her physical examination was unremarkable , with normal carotid upstrokes , clear chest , regular rate and rhythm , and benign abdomen .on neurological examination , she was alert with normal cognitive function .her affect is a bit anxious .her pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , 4 to 2 millimeters , direct and consensually .fields were full , extra ocular movements were full with bilateral end gaze nystagmus .sensory to the face was markedly diminished to pin prick , light touch and temperature over v1 and v2 and to a lesser degree v3 .there was a minimal corneal reflex and no response to nasal tickle on the left .motor to the face was intact .vision was intact bilaterally .jaw was strong .hearing was intact on the right , severely limited on the left .palate and tongue were midline .head was turned well to the right , decreased somewhat to the left and gag was present bilaterally .strength was full on the right side and 5-/5 in the left trapezius , deltoid , ecr , triceps , ankle flexion , ankle extension and extensor hallucis longus , and 4+ iliopsoas .the deep tendon reflexes revealed 3+ in the lower extremities , 2+ in the upper extremities , upgoing toe on the left and a question of an upgoing toe versus withdrawal on the right .there was no ocular dysmetria or speech dysarthria .her regular gait was unsteady and tandem gait was quite unstable .the rapid alternating movements , fine finger movements , finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin were all decreased on the left .in addition , there was question of some upgaze nystagmus and diminished upgaze in the left eye , perhaps to 90%. .laboratory data :admission labs were unremarkable .hospital course :on 11/8/93 a left frontal temporal craniectomy was done and an extensive subtotal removal was done .complete resection of the tumor was not possible due to its involvement with the brain stem .the patient tolerated the procedure well , however developed a more complete fifth cranial nerve palsy in the v1 to v2 distributions , a new sixth nerve palsy , and postoperatively had a transient seventh nerve palsy which was almost completely resolved at the time of discharge .she was discharged to rehabilitation for an approximately two week stay .she is using an eye patch which greatly relieves her discomfort due to the diplopia .she underwent a slow solu-medrol taper over two weeks .she complained of persistent neck stiffness , likely secondary to a chemical meningitis .her wound remained clean and dry and she was discharged to rehabilitation after a computerized tomography scan without contrast was performed for postoperative assessment .medications on discharge :tegretol 200 mg po t.i.d. , cimetidine 300 mg po q6h while on steroids , and a solu-medrol taper as indicated .she will return to dr. fossa 's office .            cori louellpascgach , m.d.dictating for :            telshey k. swatlleebtik , m.d.tr :            ye / bmotdd :            11-17-93td :            11/18/93cc :stat to
