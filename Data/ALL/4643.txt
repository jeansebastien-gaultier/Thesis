while could relate to overlying soft tissue, additionalfocus of consolidation is not excluded.[7-7]: cxr: findings: as compared to the previous radiograph, theextent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is stable. onthe left, an area ofparenchymal opacity, previously qualified as potentialpneumonia, hasincreased in extent. there is a newly occurred small reactiveleft-sidedpleural effusion

cough,admitted to micu for hypoxemia requiring nrb, found to havetrilobar pna.acute diagnoses:# multilobar pneumonia, likely bacterial: cta results showedsignificant tri-lobar pna which appeared significant enough forshunting to explain his degree of hypoxia. his pna was treatedand oxygen was weaned down and he tolerated walking around floorwith nasal cannula, though he wore face tent at baseline forcomfort. he was initially treated for cap but because he worksin a health-care setting and considering the extent of pna withhypoxia he was treated for hcap coverage with iv vancomycin,cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. on the floor he quickly weaned downto room air and was breathing comfortably with occasionallysputum tinged with blood. he was discharged on a 10-day courseof levofloxacin & linezolid, to cover ensure coverage of bothmsra and other usual cap organisms.#atrial fibrillation with rvr: dr. [known lastname 23] initially presentedin new onset a.fib with runs of rvr into 160s with associatedhypotension. he was treated with a 10mg/hr dilt drip andspontaneously converted to sinus and he remained in sinus rhythmthroughout the rest of his hospitalization. although he has ahistory of palpitations in the past (and has been on a holtermonitor), this is his first episode of atrial fibrillation.given his chads2 score of 0-1 it was felt that he did notrequire anything other than a daily aspirin (which he has beentaking as an outpatient).  the aspirin was held due tointermittent hemoptysis/blood streaked sputum, but dr. [known lastname 23]was advised to discuss reinitiation of aspirin as an outpatient.chronic diagnoses: none.transitional issues:# follow-up: the patient was instructed to follow up with hisnew primary care doctor within 1-2 weeks.  he was told todiscuss reinitation of aspirin with his pcp when his hemoptysisceases.  he should also be screened for hypertension, as it wasnoted that his blood pressure was elevated to the 140s-150ssystolic while he was on the floor.medications on admission:- aspirin 81mg po dailydischarge medications:1. linezolid 600 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q12h (every 12hours) for 10 days.disp:20 tablet(s) refills:02. levofloxacin 750 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily) for 10 days.disp:10 tablet(s) refills:03. codeine-guaifenesin 10-100 mg/5 ml syrup sig: 5-10 mls po q6h(every 6 hours) as needed for cough: do not drive while takingthis medication.disp:500 ml(s) refills:0discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:primary diagnosis:- multifocal pneumonia- sepsissecondary diagnosis:- atrial fibrillation with rapid  ventricular responsedischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:dr. [known lastname 23], it was a pleasure to participate in your care whileyou were hospital. you were initially admitted to the micu on adiltiazem drip to control your rapid atrial fibrillation.  youhad an ongoing oxygen requirement and it was discovered that youhad a multifocal pneumonia.  you were treated withbroad-spectrum iv antibiotics, which were transitioned to poantibiotics a day prior to your discharge.medication changes:- medications added: linezolid 600 mg q12h for 10 days- medications added: guaifenesin-codeine cough syrup as neededfor cough- medications stopped: aspirin- medications changed: none.followup instructions:we are working on a follow up appointment in [state ]group with your new primary care physician [last name (namepattern4) ].
