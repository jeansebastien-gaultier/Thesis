the patient wasstarted on iv lasix along with zaroxolyn andresponded with a brisk diuresis over the course of the admission.the patient's weight declined by approximately 5.2 kg. it wasestimated that the total volume of fluid removed was approximately15 liters. the patient was reported great improvement in hersymptoms , was able to ambulate without requiring supplementaloxygen. the patient was switched to oral lasix and continued herdiuresis. the day prior to discharge , the patient was switched tooral torsemide , and she will be discharged on that medication.2. atrial fibrillation - the patient was noted to have new onsetof atrial fibrillation while being seen in cardiology clinic on8/3/02 . since it was not known how long the atrial fibrillationhad been going on , a decision was made to anticoagulate thepatient. she was initially started on intravenous unfractionatedheparin while starting anticoagulation with coumadin. the patientreached a therapeutic inr of 2.5 within approximately 4-5 days andthe iv heparin was discontinued. at the time of discharge , thepatient inr was 3.2. she will have inr follow up through herprimary cardiologist , dr. janousek . currently , the decision tocardiovert the patient is left in the hands of her outpatientcardiologist.3. urinary tract infection -
