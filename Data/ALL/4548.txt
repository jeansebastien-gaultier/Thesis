[known lastname 62523] had somerestriction in eye movements but no gaze deviation and nolateralizing signs at this point. neurology believes withdrawalis the most likely etiology. if fevers develop, he may require alumbar puncture. such as infection  metabolic derangements, drugoverdose, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding canalso mimic or coexist with withdrawal. in the absence ofcomplications, symptoms can persist for up to seven days.additionally as he does not seem to have full abduction of hiseyes, neurology recommends continuing on iv thiamine forpresumed wernicke's. given that the mammillary bodies areenriched with dopamine receptors, would avoid haldol as this mayexacerbate his wernicke korsakoff's pathology.past medical history:-htn-etoh abuse-hcv-h/o

fromwernicke-korsakoff's syndrome, who presented from his nursingfacility with altered mental status.#. delirium/altered mental status: patient had been agitated atnursing facility. tsh, b12, folate, and lactate all withinnormal limits. ammonia also normal. patient was been afebrile,wbc was normal, cxr and ua negative. ct head was negative.neurology and psychiatry consulted.  psychiatry discovered thatpatient was receiving oxazepam at facility. combined with thesignificant (12mg iv) lorazepam he received in emergencydepartment and 5mg iv more on initial evening in icu,benzodiazepine intoxication felt to be responsible for much ofaltered mental status. benzos stopped and replaced with zyprexato a maximum dose of 35mg daily with monitoring of qtc (407 onlast day of icu stay).  patient continued on folate,multivitamin, vitamin d and thiamine.  patient restarted on homeolanzapine 5 mg qam and 15 mg qpm per psychiatry recs.  ekg wasperiodically monitored for prolongation of the qtc. he continuedto be agitated particularly at night and was started ontrazadone 100 mg qhs and mirtazepine 30 mg po qhs.  he improvedon this regimen.  after originally planning to send the patientto a dementia unit, eventually his brother made the decision totake him home with 24 hour supervision at his home.  vitaminsupplementation was discontinued on discharge as patient is nolonger drinking alcohol.  he will follow up frequently with hispcp and will also follow up with cognitive neurology.#. hyponatremia: patient presented with hyponatremia.  he mayhave been volume down at his
