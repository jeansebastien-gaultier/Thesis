uncomplicated pancreatitis with no evidence of abscess orfluid collection.2. pleural effusions, left greater than right, withconsolidation in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.3. old fractures of the pelvis.brief hospital course:# hypoxic respiratory failure - secondary to mycoplasma pna forwhich she completed 14 day course of levofloxacin, evolved toards from sepsis. subsequently complicated by likely ventilatorassociated pneumonia, culture and bronchial lavage negative,empirically treated with a course of vancomycin and cefepime.also, complicated by severe polyneuropathy from likely criticalcare neuropathy. nif was measured and was in the 30s range. ptwas weaned to ps 5/0 on the 13th day of hospitalization andextubation was attempted. however the patient becameincreasingly tachypneic and agitated about 12 hours afterextubation and was reintubated. failure was thought to be due torespiratory muscle fatigue, poor underlying lung function in thecontext of pneumonia, possible component of volume overload. atracheostomy was placed the next day as well as a peg tube. shewas successful with trach mask trials several days after trachplacement on high flow o2.  she was successful for > 12hoursdaily, but on several occasions became tachypneic in theevening, thought to be influenced largely by anxiety rather thanfatigue, requiring placement back on ps overnight.  she was,however, trialed for 24 hours on trach mask and was fatigued thefollowing day requiring full 24 hours back on ps.  this waslikely [3-6] to true respiratory muscle fatigue..# pna: from mycoplasma, treated with 14 day course oflevofloxacin. subsequently complicated by likely ventilatorassociated pneumonia, culture and bronchial lavage negative,empirically treated with a course of vancomycin and cefepime..# septic shock: lactate on admission 2.3, hypotension, elevatedwbc with 2 bands, tachypnea and tachycardia. initially withpressor requirement. initial broad spectrum abx werediscontinued once source of sepsis was found to be due tomycoplasma and a course of 14 days of levofloxacin wascompleted. the patient also was treated with stress dosesteroids initially, which were subsequently weaned to baselineprednisone dose for chronic ra of 20mg..# clostridium difficile infection: diagnosed on [1-22]. pt. willcomplete a 7 day (post other antibiotics) course of flagyl(flagyl course to be completed on [2122-2-6] after receiving her tiddosing that day). diarrhea is much improved..# pancreatitis:  thought [3-6] to propofol originally withelevated amylase and lipase.  once her propofol was d/c'd, heramylase normalized.  her lipase decreased, but remained elevatedin the 150s.  other lfts were normal.  her tube feeds were heldtransiently when her lipase failed to completely resolve and shehad mild epigastric discomfort.  given that her epigastricdiscomfort was post g tube placement, it resolved and tube feedswere reinitiated.  she did have high residuals so was notoriginally at goal.  reglan was started and tube feeds wereadvanced.  she is now tolerating tube feeds at goal withoutreglan..# critical illness neuropathy: severe distal weakness, slightimprovement towards the end of her hospital stay. emg and nerveconduction studies showed mild, proximal myopathy with asuperimposed geneneralized polyneuropathy, predominantly axonal.the picture is consistent with critical illness polyneuropathyand myopathy.  her strength has been consistently increasing,but deficit remains.  she will need continued physical therapyfor this..# rash, eosinophilia:  during her course of cefepime andvancomycin she developed a rash and eosinophilia.  once her 7day course of cefepime and vanco was complete, her rash resolvedalthough she remained mildly subjectively itchy requiringfexofenadine.  her eosinophils remained elevated, but this alsostarted to resolve.  there was no other clear drug source andsuspiscion for infective cause was very low..# low grade fever: intermittent low grade fever to tmax of100.2.  she has bal, urine and blood cultures pending from[2122-2-5], but suspiscion for infection is low given normal wbccount and no left shift on diff.  these cultures should befollowed up..# rheumatoid arthritis:  patient was transiently on stress dosesteroids in the setting of sepsis.  steroids were reduced to herhome dose of 20mg po prednisone with the resolution of sepsis.the need for pcp prophylaxis was discussed given chronically on20mg prednisone daily.  the need for this dose in the setting ofher ra and pcp prophylaxis was discussed with her rheumatologistand her dose of prednisone was decreased to 15mg po prednisoneas she is not currently complaining of joint symptoms.  she wasnot started on bactrim while inpatient and if her chronicprednisone dose requirement increases, this should bereaddressed.  additionally, given her age, sex and chronicprednisone, she was started on vitamin d and calcium..# anemia with hct drop: hct has been stable 24-26 from originaldrop from 29-31.  anemia w/u included abd ct not revealing forbleed.  ldh is elevated, haptoglobin elevated as well, but thisis in the setting of inflammation and, thus may not reflectaccurately hemolysis.  stools were guaiac negative.  ironrevealed normal iron, elevated ferritin, and low tibc c/w acd..# depression:  patient has a history of depression and was onelavil previously.  she is not sure why this was discontinuedoriginally.  while hospitalized, she was experiencing low moodand general anxiety.  thus, celexa was started at 20mg daily on[2122-1-31].  this can be titrated as appropriate upon discharge..# hypertension: after hypotension in the context of sepsis hasresolved, the patient hypertension which was controlled withlabetalol and captopril.  she did require occasional fluid bolusin setting of negative fluid status and low uop and transienthypotension, to which her bp responded well..# a-flutter: transient episodes in the context of highadrenergic state after acute sepsis resolved. hemodynamicallystable and was in nsr for > 1week prior to discharge, continuedon bb..# steroid induced hypergylcemia: transiently on glargine, thenchanged to regular ss only as steroids were weaned.  her bloodsugars have been well controlled.  she has not been requiring sscoverage, but this should be initiated if glucose controlworsens.#
