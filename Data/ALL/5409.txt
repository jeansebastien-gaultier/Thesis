course:ms. [known lastname 99778] is a 41 year old female with warm autoimmunehemolytic anemia who presented ten days status-post splenectomywith abdominal pain and dyspnea with a hematocrit of 11 and someevidence of hemolysis.anemia: her laboratories at osh were consistent with but notdiagnostic of hemolysis; she did not display signs of activebleeding. the haptoglobin at [hospital1 18] was elevated pointing againsthemolysis. given her low hematocrit. she was initially managedin the icu. a ct scan at [hospital1 18] showed extensive clot burden inher portal system, likely related to her prior surgery. shereceived four units of major antibody crossmatched blood, andadditional tubes were sent to the red cross for furthercrossmatching.hematology saw the patient in the emergency room, andrecommended treatment with steroids and cyclosporine. she wasstarted on solumedrol 80mg iv daily and cyclosporine 150mg poq12hours. hemolysis labs were monitored as well as cyclosporinelevels. the surgical team also followed the patient in the icu.after transfer to the medical floor, hct gradually rose daily to36.6 at time of discharge. solumedrol was tapered and convertedto prednisione. cyclosporine was also tapered to 75mg [hospital1 ]. ldhwas persistently elevated likely secondary to abdominal clotprocess. f/u was scheduled with her hemtologist, dr. [last name (stitle) 2148].abdominal pain/portal thrombus: the pain was diffuse, severe,and out of proportion to exam. ct scan of abdomen did show largeportal clot burden. empiric metronidazole was started until ac.diff could be obtained, but as pt did not have a bm, it wascontinued until day of discharge. her pain was controlled withdilaudid as needed.  her diet was advanced to regular, but onthe day of discharge (against medical advice), she did nottolerate jello without iv dilaudid.  plan was for pt to remainuntil able to tolerate clears with only po pain meds, but shechose to leave ama (form signed). she has f/u scheduled with dr.[last name (stitle) ] within one week. expressed understanding of need toreturn if abdominal pain increases. given 5 days worth of homedose of percocet.thrombocytosis:  likely related to recent splenectomy, improvedfrom 1.5 million to 900k at time of d/c.leukocytosis: likely reactive process + related to high dosesteroids. no fevers.  no localizing sources of infection withthe exception of abdominal pain. she was started on empiricflagyl which was discontinued at time of discharge. white countpeaked at 36 and fell to 17.5 at time of discharge.acute kidney injury:  creatinine 1.3 from baseline < 1.0. thewas felt to most likely be prerenal from dehydration. thisreturned to baseline prior to d/c..hypertension: likely secondary to steroids and cyclosporine. notstating anti-htn at this time, continue to monitor; shouldimprove with taper. bps peaking in the 170/80 range at time ofdischarge..anxiety: the patient was noted to be very anxious, and thisseemed to worsen after the initiation of steroids. there isconcern that the steroid is causing side effects, includingpsychosis, as it had done in the past according to the patient.she was continued on home benzodiazepines (klonopin), as well ashaldol prn. disscharged on home klonopin dose.pt discharged ama.  our recommendation was that she stayuntil being able to tolerate po with only percocet for paincontrol. she signed ama form and expressed understanding ofrisks.medications on admission:benzoyl peroxide cleanserclobetasol creamclonazepam 1 mg [hospital1 ]:prncyclosporin 150 mg [hospital1 ]folic acid 6 mg dailyomeprazole 40 mg dailypercocet 7.5-325 mg tablet 1-2 tabs q6h:prnparoxetine 30 mg dailycalcium-vitamin dmagnesium [hospital1 ]multivitamindischarge medications:1. bactrim 80-400 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day:prophylaxis.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:22. calcium carbonate 500 mg tablet, chewable sig: two (2)tablet, chewable po bid (2 times a day).3. cholecalciferol (vitamin d3) 400 unit tablet sig: two (2)tablet po daily (daily).4. prednisone 10 mg tablet sig: three (3) tablet po once a day.disp:90 tablet(s) refills:05. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) sig: two (2)capsule, delayed release(e.c.) po daily (daily).6. paroxetine hcl 30 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).7. folic acid 1 mg tablet sig: six (6) tablet po daily (daily).8. cyclosporine 25 mg capsule sig: three (3) capsule po twice aday.disp:180 capsule(s) refills:09. clobetasol 0.05 % cream sig: one (1) appl topical daily(daily).10. clonazepam 1 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q8h (every 8hours) as needed for anxiety.11. warfarin 2.5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po once a day.disp:60 tablet(s) refills:212. multivitamins  oral13. percocet 7.5-325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po every six (6)hours as needed for pain.disp:40 tablet(s) refills:0discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:autoimmune hemolytic anemiaportal vein thrombosisthrombocytosisanxietydischarge condition:discharged against medical advice. is not tolerating solid foodwithout iv dilaudid at the time of discharge.discharge instructions:dear ms.
