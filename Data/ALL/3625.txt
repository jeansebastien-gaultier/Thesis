heart failure.significant problems: aortic insufficiency.valvular cardiomyopathy.mitral regurgitation.tricuspid regurgitation.hypertension.hemolytic anemia.chronic renal insufficiency.history of present illness: this is a 50 year-old man withvalvular cardiomyopathy , status postthree aortic valve replacements who presents with no acutecomplaints but progressive decline in daily function. mr. toher 'shistory begins in march of 1995 when he presented with shortness ofbreath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the setting ofmedication ( lasix and/or procardia for hypertension ).noncompliant , he was found by echo to have severe aorticinsufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricularhypokinesis and ejection fraction of 45%. he subsequentlyunderwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valverepair , aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration. onemonth post surgery he required repeat aortic valve replacement withdehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess withcultures positive for yeast. at this time he also requiredcoronary artery reimplantation and annular repair.hospital course: his hospital course was additionally complicatedby the development of third degree heart blocknecessitating the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. afterdischarge mr. ogaz did generally well for the following yearsuntil march of 1999 when he again presented with increasingshortness of breath. echo then revealed moderate to severe aorticinsufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation. cardiaccatheterization showed clear coronary arteries. at this time hisaortic valve was again replaced with a st. jude valve. againfollowing discharge mr. bassi did generally well until march of2001 when again he presented with shortness of breath. at thattime echo showed at least mild paravalvular aortic regurgitationwith left ventricular dilatation ( systolic diameter 6.1 cm ) alongwith 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and anejection fraction of 15 to 20%. stress testing at this time showeda physical work capacity of 15.1. it is not documented what wasdone at this time but apparently his lasix was increased from 40b.i.d. to 80 b.i.d. with good effect.regarding this admission , mr. clyatt reports that he has beenfeeling fine and has been in the hospital because his doctors wantto replace his valve , or if that doesn't work to give him a newheart. he reports no increasing dyspnea , fatigue , ankle edema orabdominal girth. he sleeps on three pillows at night and has notrecently been shortness of breath when lying flat. he is able todo chores around the house without getting shortness of breath butusually does get shortness of breath after one flight of stairs.he doesn't complain of significant disability or quality of lifeimpairment as a result of his heart condition. he notes that hehas not been able to participate in the marching band over the lastyear but that he is still able to play seated.mr. pattengale attributes his disease to having been noncompliant withprocardia following a cerebrovascular accident in 1993. he saysthat "he brought on his heart problems himself".past medical history: otherwise notable for hypertension , acerebrovascular accident in 1993 , anembolism to the left foot in 1998 and chronic renal insufficiencywith a creatinine of 1.4 to 2.2 in july of 1999.allergies: he is allergic to zestril which gives him perioralangioedema.medications on admission: lasix 80 mg b.i.d. , atenolol 50 mgq. day , avapro 150 mg q. day , coumadin 5mg q. day , zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , niferex 150 mg q. day.family history: negative for heart disease.social history: he has a 35 pack/year smoking history and drinksonly occasionally. mr. felsenthal is on permanentdisability leave from his job at ph lub ge which involved a lot ofheavy lifting. he lives at home with his wife and son and spendsmost of his day there. he is active in a entsce pu si where helikes to play the base drum.physical examination: mr. pellon is a thin , healthy appearingblack man in no apparent distress. heartrate is 65 , blood pressure 120/170. oxygen saturation 98% on roomair. his carotid pulse was normal in volume. jugular venouspressure is 7 cm. his lungs were clear. his pmi was vibratoryand quality and prominent lateral to the anterior axillary line.he had a normal s1 with an ejection sound and loud prosthetic s2 aswell as a 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border anda 3/4 holodiastolic murmur at the left lower sternal borderradiating to the right upper sternal border. his abdomen wasnondistended with no organomegaly. his extremities were warm withfaint pulses.laboratory data: labs were remarkable for a creatinine of 2.3 ,hematocrit of 33.5 with an mcv of 83.5. rbw was28.8 , reticulocyte count of 6.6 and ldh of 1 , 777.mr. coples had an echo here that showed severe aortic insufficiencywith a severely dilated left ventricle ( and diastolic diameter of7.0 and systolic diameter of 6.3 ) as well as mild to moderatemitral and tricuspid regurgitation and ejection fraction of 20 to25%. exercise testing showed an oxygen uptake of 12.7. on cathhis pulmonary artery pressure , wedge pressure and pulmonaryvascular resistance were 47/16 , 13 and 379 which fell to 26/4 , 5and 137 respectively with nipride. his systemic vascularresistance was markedly elevated to 2400 and his thick cardiacoutput and cardiac index was 3.62 and 2.31.amlodipine was then started and lasix was increased in an effort toincrease systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary wedgepressures. the remainder of the transplant workup results wereunremarkable except for a significantly reduced diffusing capacityof 59% corrected. a creatinine clearance of 48.4 and a psa of18.1 , prostate biopsy and bone scan were both negative.his admission was otherwise notable for an elevated creatinine of3.0 in the setting of perioperative levofloxacin and gentamicin aswell as aggressive vasodilator therapy. his creatine was backdown to his baseline of low 2's before discharge. mr. delullo wasdischarged home in stable condition on the following medications.discharge medications: atenolol 25 q. day , lasix 120 b.i.d ,coumadin 5 mg q. day , amlodipine 2.5 mg q.day , avapro 150 mg q. day , niferex 150 mg q. day and ranitidine 150mg b.i.d.follow-up: mr. feyler will follow-up with dr. daniel marshburn in twoweeks.dictated by: winfred gardner , md theron postinattending: darrell a. silverness , m.d. sr20wl792/958575batch: 46825
