[known lastname 100424] is a 78 year old gentleman with stage iv nsclcadmitted for lactic acidosis..# lactic acidosis: anion gap of 15 on admission. during recentadmission ([6-28]), no lactate was measured although ag rangedfrom [1-2] and bicarb 24-26 during admission with albumin >4.differential includes type a lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion)from sirs in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from acsversus type b lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or activemalignancy.  no evidence of liver mets or decreased syntheticfunction to suggest inability to clear lactate.  while in theicu, the patient's metformin was held, venous lactate levels andanion gap were followed.  he received maintenence fluids.  hislactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor..# chest pain/cad: low suspicion for acs given ecg in edunchanged without st-t wave abnormalities. cta negative for peand patient was cp free throughout his stay in the icu.  hishome meds including asa, statin, lisinopril, and nadolol werecontinued..# leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, wbc and fevercurve were stable in icu..# lung ca: per primary oncologist, dr [last name (stitle) 3274], decadron wascontinued.  the patient received whole brain xrt while in theicu, with plans to receive another dose the day after icudischarge.# ground glass opacities: patchy ground glass opacities on ctpresent in 6/[2174].  given heteregenous nature, unlikely to beedema.  less likely to be blood, and low likelihood givenclinical presentation for bacterial infection.  given recentdexamethasone therapy, concern for pcp given lack ofprophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiationof dexamethasone makes this less likely.  pt was started on pcpprophylaxis with bactrim.# copd: advair, tiotropium, and albuterol were continued..# htn: home regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril was continued..# diabetes, type 2: metformin given lactic acidosis and contrastload, pt was covered

instructions:you were admitted because you were found in clinic to be shortof breath with chest pain. a heart related cause was ruled outwith testing, however another test showed that you had too muchlactic acid. this is usually a seroius sign that your body isnot getting enough oxygen. thus, you spent a night in the icu.it was discovered also that your blood sugar was far too high.accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolleddiabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it. wefollowed your labs and you gradually improved. at the same time,you were able to receive radiation therapy..you were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen:new lantus 20 units in the morningnew glypizide 5 mg twice a daynew bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroidsstop metforminhold ezetimibe, fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin(such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor.your sugars are elevated due to your steroids - once yoursteroids are decreased this diabetes regimen will need to beadjusted. therefore it is very important to follow-up with yourprimary care doctor. call your primary care doctor, [doctor last
