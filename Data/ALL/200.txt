:02/06/2005principal diagnosis :coronary artery disease .associated diagnoses :angina , failed coronary bypass graft , elevated cholesterol , hypertension , atrial fibrillation , prostatism , and cataracts .principal procedure :on 2/6/2005 , left heart catheterization .other procedures :on 2/6/2005 , left ventriculography ; on 2/6/2005 , bilateral coronary angiography ; and on 2/6/2005 , bypass graft and internal mammary artery angiography .medications on discharge :lipitor 30 mg p.o. daily , accupril 5 mg p.o. daily , folic acid 1 mg p.o. daily , cardizem cd 120 mg p.o. daily , atenolol 25 mg p.o. daily , asa 325 mg p.o. daily , and plavix 75 mg p.o. daily .history of the present illness :mayta neek is a 69-year-old patient of dr. queszucenove tadl at cochusetts medical center .he presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .he has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .his first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by dr. riez .he had lima to the lad and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .he presented with angina and had an occluded lad and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .he had normal left ventricular function .he did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in march of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .the left main was normal .the lad was also occluded .the circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .the lima to the lad was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the lad .the snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .for this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by dr. riez .he had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .he had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the lad bypassing the mid lesion .the lima was left from the first surgery .he did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .he had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm s660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .he did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .he therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .past medical history :his past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .he also has had cataract repairs .family history :he has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .social history :his social history is that he lives in lotyvall 1 , quera , minnesota with his wife second .he has four children .he is present in a capefrecam luhthousy .he does not drink and does not smoke .allergies :he is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .physical examination :on exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .his blood pressure is 130/75 .his pulse is 50 and regular .his neck veins are not distended .his head and neck exam is normal .his lungs are clear .his cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .his abdomen is benign .his peripheral pulses are intact .his neurologic exam was nonfocal .he is fully oriented .laboratory data on admission :includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .there , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the rv marginal and the right-sided pda was patent .the lad was occluded and the lima to the proximal lad was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the lad and that was also patent .the vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .the culprit territory was the distal left-sided pda coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .this was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .it was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .he tolerated the procedure well .he was monitored for the day .he ambulated without difficulty .he was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at sko gerb timp valley health and at middso memorial hospital 's .he will remain on beta blockers , ace inhibitors , statins , aspirin and plavix indefinitely .electronically signed iard tibelledie fat , m.d. 02/08/2005 18:08_____________________________ iard tibelledie fat , m.d.tr
