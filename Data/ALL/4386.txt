record date: 2097-08-28 intern/med student admit note, team 3name:  mr. danny nielsonmr #:  9156593date of admission: 08/28/2097admitting physician: dr. gene quadri, md	pcp: dr. ulises noelsource of hx:  patient, available notecode: full          cc:     want to get my chemo   id: mr. nielson is a 77 yom w/ stage iiib diffuse large b-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of chop and 1 cycle of r-ice who presents now for cycle 2 of r-ice.  hpi:   mr. nielson was in his usual state of health until march of this year when he began noticing increasing swelling in his left leg over a period of three weeks.  he also developed b/l groin swelling greater on the left; the swelling in the left groin was tender.  he presented in early april where ct and pet scan of the pelvis and abdomen revealed a 6.0 cm inguinal node, a chain of nodes in the retrocrural space, adenopathy in the external iliac chain (largest 3.5 cm), and two nodes in the retroperitoneal space in between the ivc and aorta.  he underwent biopsy of the left groin mass two weeks later revealing dlbcl confimed by immunophenotyping.  subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed polyclonal b-cell populations and an inverted cd4/cd8 t cell ratio, with no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.  the patient underwent his initial two cycles of chop in may, and experienced no adverse effects except for generalized weakness.  pet exam in early june revealed larger left groin mass, improvement in lymphadenopathy, and a small pancreatic cystic lesion.  it was undetermined whether this represented treatment effect or worsening of disease.  the patient subsequently had his next two chop treatments in mid june and early july.  pet scan and lymph node biopsy in early july revealed unchanged disease with evidence of fibrosis and inflammation.  the patient was seen in clinic by dr. quadri twice in july, with the second visit revealing increased pet avidity and persistence of the primary mass.  given the persistence of the mass and lack of response to chop, the patient was evaluated by dr. rodgers of the wdmc one week later on 7/28 for consideration of auto-sct vs more aggressive chemo regimen.  due to the patient's age and consideration of risk/benefit, it was decided that the best approach would be to attempt a more aggressive chemo regimen first.  mr. nielson was admitted on 8/2/2097 to receive his first cycle of r-ice with dose-reduced ifos and carboplatin becuase of h/o nephrectomy.  he tolerated the treatment fairly well with some panycytopenia.  patient felt the r-ice regimen was a little    harder    on him than the chop regimen.  he felt effects including fatigue and constipation that resolved back to baseline in a few days.  on 8/9, he was given 2 units of packed red cells due to anemia and on 8/16, he was given a unit of pheresis platelets for his thrombocytopenia as well as two units of packed red blood cells for his anemia.  he was initially scheduled to receive cycle 2 of r-ice on 8/22 but that was delayed due to his thrombocytopenia.  he says that he currently feels cold-intolerance and fatigue that is the same as when he first started his chemotherapy in may.  he denies any recent n/v, diarrhea, constipation, lightheadedness, orthostatic dizziness, hematuria, brbpr, or melena.  side effects of note from previous cycles of chemotherapy include generalized weakness, cold-intolerance, and constipation. pmh:1.   wegener's granulomatosis - treated successfully and maintained on low dose steroids2.	dm ii3.	cad4.	known aortic stenosis w/ valve area 1.3psh1.   s/p l

man w/ stage iiib diffuse large b-cell lymphoma s/p 4 cycles of chop and 1 cycle of r-ice her now for his cycle 2 of r-ice.  we will maintain hydration and monitor renal function as this pt has only one kidney. his type two diabetes will be controlled with his home regimen and his maintenance steroids that he takes for wegener's will be held as they are replaced by dexamethasone via r-ice. we will transfuse to maintain platelets over 20k and hct over 25 as needed. his exam is non-concerning.  _______________________________________________________________________nicolas etheridge md, phd
