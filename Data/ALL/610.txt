 3/31/93 10:00:00 am              one sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the              transverse colon.  the polyp was three mm in size.              polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  resection              was complete.  retrieval was not done.              one sessile polyp with no bleeding was found in the              transverse colon.  the polyp was three mm in size.              polypectomy was performed with a cold snare.  resection              was complete.  retrieval was complete.              hemorrhoids with no bleeding were found.              a few diverticula were found in the sigmoid colon and in the              hepatic flexure.impression:   1) single polyp -
