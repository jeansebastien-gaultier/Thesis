baseline of 1.8. he had a hematocrit of 36.8. ck equal to 417 ,mb equal to 15 , troponin t equal to 0.09. ekg showed normal sinusrhythm , first-degree av block , left axis deviation , t waveinversion in avl , and t wave flattening in lead 1.hospital course by system: cardiovascular: the patient wasstarted on aspirin , plavix , lopressor ,zocor , heparin , and a 2b3a inhibitor before cardiaccatheterization. zestril was held secondary to marginal renalfunction. cardiac catheterization on september revealed occlusionof svg to rca and svg to om. these lesions were treated with atotal of five stents. the last om manipulation resulted inshowering of plaque and subsequent chest pain and ekg changes ( stelevation in precordial leads ). following cardiac catheterizationthe patient had no further episodes of chest pain and remainedhemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course. he wassuccessfully diuresed following his acute renal failure.renal/gu: the patient has a baseline chronic renal insufficiencywith a creatinine of 1.8. following cardiac catheterization thepatient developed acute renal failure secondary to iv contrast witha creatinine peaking at 6.8 , and then improving gradually to 4.2upon discharge. while in the hospital the patient was followed byrenal and urology consult team. the patient had developedhematuria while on aspirin , plavix , heparin , and 2b3a inhibitor.his hematuria resolved gradually. a renal ultrasound demonstratedno evidence of obstruction , but did show several simple cysts , aswell as a calcified cyst which was further evaluated by ct scan ,which demonstrated a likely hyperdense cyst , but follow-up mri wasrecommended to more definitively rule out the possibility of aneoplasm. ultrasound showed no evidence of clots in the bladder.electrolytes were closely followed and adjusted appropriatelyduring the hospital course. the acute renal failure wascomplicated by moderate volume overload in the setting of depressedef. the patient was continued on lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. urologyalso recommended an outpatient cystoscopy to rule out tumor versusfoley trauma as the cause of the patient's hematuria.heme: following cardiac catheterization , the patient developedepistaxis , frank hematuria , and coffee-ground emesis ( secondary toswallowing blood and not a gi bleed ). the hematocrit fell to 29and the patient was transfused with one unit of packed red bloodcells. heparin and tegralen were stopped , the patient wascontinued on aspirin and plavix. the hematuria resolved , and noclots were seen on abdominal ultrasound. the hematocrit remainedstable throughout the rest of the patient's hospital course.endocrine: for his diabetes , the patient was maintained on tzisliding scale while in-house , later was restarted on his homeregimen of insulin 70/30 , and was discharged on this home regimen.disposition: at the time of discharge the patient was ambulating ,and arrangement were made for the patient to
