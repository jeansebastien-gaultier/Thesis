[name (ni) ] smoking or ethanol use history.physical examination:  vital signs:  t-max 104.3??????, currently100.8??????, heart rate 107-110, blood pressure 110/27,respirations 15-20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.general:  the patient was an alert, ill-appearing woman withpostsurgical occiput.  head and neck:  injected conjunctivae,greenish ocular discharge, ulcerative oral lesions.cardiovascular:  regular rhythm.  rapid rate.  no murmurs.pulmonary:  clear to auscultation bilaterally.  abdomen:normoactive bowel sounds.  soft, nontender, nondistended.extremities:  no edema.  skin:  diffuse erythema and pustuleson the face.  patulous pustules on the chest, back, andproximal upper extremities.  gu:  no genital lesions.laboratory data:  hematocrit 34.1, wbc 10.3, platelet count291,000, differential of 87 neutrophils, 0 bands;

urine culture pending; blood culturestimes two pending; conjunctival culture pending.hospital course:  given the patient's severe exfoliative skininvolvement with rapid progression and extensive involvementof the body, she was admitted to the medical intensive careunit for close monitoring.  she was started on prophylacticoxacillin to cover skin flora, and dermatology was consultedalong with neurology and ophthalmology for the ophthalmicinvolvement.the patient's course in the intensive care unit wasuneventful, and she was discharged to the floor with veryclose monitoring which included q.1 hour pred forteapplication to the eye and close consultation withophthalmology.  with regard to her skin lesions, theycontinued exfoliate over the next couple of days, and herskin care included frequent vaseline hydrated petroleumapplication to decrease insensible losses.  the patient'sintake and output were closely monitored and replacedappropriately; however, the intensive nursing carerequirement made it difficult for the patient to receiveadequate on the floor, and therefore, she was transferred tothe medical intensive care unit again for frequent ophthalmicapplications and skin care.while in the micu, the patient continued to have meticulousskin care and eye care.  the skin lesions continued todesquamate and exfoliate which is the naturalprogression of this disease.  she began to have involvementof the genital area with continued desquamation of theexfoliative lesions.  her course in the intensive care unitwithin the next 8-10 days was a slow but gradual improvementfrom a dermatologic and ophthalmologic standpoint.from a cardiovascular standpoint, she was in sinustachycardia which was felt to be secondary to her[doctor last name ]-[location (un) ] syndrome leading to dehydration andinsensible fluid losses.while in the intensive care unit, she was also found to bemildly hypoxic which is likely secondary to atelectasisbecause of the patient's immobility.  lower extremitydopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses werefound.from and infectious disease standpoint, the patient wasstarted on intravenous oxacillin empirically.  blood cultureson the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottlefrom her picc line grew out gram-positive cocci on [7-27].she was started on a course of vancomycin.  subsequently theorganism was found to be cns with corynebacterium, andvancomycin was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor on[8-5].the patient's course on the floor was uncomplicated withcontinued improvement.dermatology:  the patient, as indicated, improveddramatically from her presentation to the time of discharge.her exfoliative lesions healed over the course of thisadmission.  her skin care requirements decreased to petroleumjelly twice a day at the time of discharge.  she was able totake in oral foot without problems.ophthalmology:  the patient's eye care requirement improvedmarkedly.  she was able to open her eyes and use her visionwithout significant problems at the time of discharge.  herpred forte was discontinued on the day of discharge, and sheis to have follow-up with ophthalmology a couple of daysafter discharge.fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  on admission the patientwas begun on tpn for nutritional support.  as the patientimproved from a medical perspective, her tpn was weaned, andat the time of discharge, the patient was taking adequatep.o. with supplementation of boost.infectious disease:  at the time of admission, she wasstarted on empiric antibiotics and placed on contactprecautions secondary to her extensive skin lesions; however,as the patient improved throughout the course of thisadmission, contact precautions were discontinued, and thepatient was discharged home with services.cardiology/pulmonology:  the patient was tachycardiacthroughout this admission which was attributed to her fluidlosses secondary to [doctor last name ]-[location (un) ] syndrome; however, giventhe patient's immobility throughout the course of thisadmission, a ct angiogram was performed to evaluate forpossible pulmonary embolism, and none were found.neurology:  the patient has a history of cystic tumor statuspost resection in [month (only) 205] of this year and was started onprophylactic dilantin leading to presumed [doctor last name ]-[location (un) ]syndrome.  at the time of this admission, the patient'sdilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants werestarted, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeksafter her surgery was unlikely.  this decision was made withthe support of her neurosurgeon, dr. [last name (stitle) ] [last name (namepattern4) 1338].five days before discharge, the patient did have a syncopalevent while in the bathroom showering with the help of anursing aide.  the likely etiology of this is orthostatichypotension from her fluid losses; however, given thepatient's neurologic history, neurology was consulted toevaluate for possible seizure.  neurology's recommendationswere to obtain a repeat ct scan which was unchanged fromprevious showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensitywhich was stable.  they also recommended repeat mr imagingwhich was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axiallesion noted on ct scan.  neurology therefore agrees with theprimary team that the syncopal event was likely secondary toa vasovagal reaction.  a follow-up mr scan would berecommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence ofresidual tumor.  this can be done as an outpatient with dr.[last name (stitle) 1338].rehabilitation:  the patient throughout this admission workedwith our physical therapy people and continued to improvewith regard to range of motion and strength in the upper andlower extremities, and by the time of discharge, she wasambulating throughout the [doctor last name ] and around the hospitalwithout problems.  she was therefore discharged home withoutneed for physical therapy services.at the time of discharge, the patient has markedly improvedfrom her initial presentation and is to be discharged homewith nursing assistance.discharge status:  markedly improved.discharge diagnosis:1.  [doctor last name ]-[location (un) ] syndrome secondary to dilantin.2.  status post craniotomy on [2109-7-1], for a cysticcranial lesion, likely dysembryoplastic angioneuralepithelial lesion with features consistent with anoligodendroglioma.discharge medications:  polysporin ophthalmology o.u. q.i.d.,hydrated petroleum as needed, lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.,nystatin, boost t.i.d.follow-up:  1.  ophthalmology [2109-8-20], at 12:45p.m.  2.  primary care physician in two weeks.  3.dermatology as needed.discharge note:  please note that the patient is allergic todilantin and tegretol given her [doctor last name ]-[location (un) ] secondary todilantin.  the patient is recommended to wear an alertbracelet which indicates this reaction.
