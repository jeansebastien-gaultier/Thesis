[2131-12-12] pt was found to have bp 72/40 and decreased uop.he was given a 500 cc bouls and bps initially trended up to82/50 and then down to 70/40. he then received an additonal 1 lfluid bolus and was transferred to the icu..micu course:he received 7 liters of ivf with improvement of his bloodpressure and subsequent improvement in his mental status.psychiatry and neurology were consulted; his perseveration on "iwant to die. hurry up." did not seem consistent with a diagnosisof depression, but his behavior did raise concern of frontalrelease . neurology celexa was stopped as it has been
