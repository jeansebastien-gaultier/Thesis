greatgrandchildren. she denies any use of tobacco or denies any use ofalcohol.physical examination: vital signs showed a temperature of 98.9 ,heart rate of 78 , blood pressure 160/90 ,respiratory rate of 20 , with a room air saturation of 93%. ingeneral , obese black female in no apparent distress. heentexamination was perrl , eomi , neck supple , full range of motion , shehad a soft carotid bruit on the left , no bruits on the right , and2+ pulses bilaterally. lungs were clear. cardiovascularexamination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a soft grade1/6 systolic ejection murmur , best heard at the left lower sternalborder. abdomen had positive bowel sounds , non-tender ,nondistended. she was guaiac negative. extremities showed noclubbing , cyanosis , or edema. 2+ femoral pulses , no bruits. 2+dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. neurologic examinationwas grossly nonfocal.diagnostic studies: ekg on admission showed a heart rate of 73 ,intervals of .164 , .076 , .049 seconds for pr ,qrs , and qtc. axis was 71. no q waves and no acute st or t wavechanges.laboratory examination: sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 ,bicarb 25 , bun and creatinine of 16 and1.3 , glucose of 282. lfts were within normal limits. ck of 213 ,cholesterol 179. other labs showed a tsh of 1.5 , ferritin 181 ,tibc of 226 , troponin i was 0.0 , hematocrit was 39.4 , white count7.15 , platelet count of 348 , 000. coagulation studies were withinnormal limits. urinalysis showed 2-4 wbcs , 3+ bacteria. her urineculture revealed 50 , 000 suspected enteric gram negative rods. thisis a urine culture from 11/9/96. a chest x-ray revealed noinfiltrates.hospital course:1. cardiac: cardiac wise , she ruled out for an mi by enzymes andekg. she underwent a standard bruce protocol ett on 6/25/96. sheexercised for 8 minutes , stopped secondary to fatigue. maximumheart rate was 95 , maximum blood pressure 170/75. she developedtypical angina in her recovery which spontaneously resolved. shehad 1 mm down sloping st segment depressions in ii , iii , f , v4through v6 , which resolved into recovery. these changes weresuggestive of ischemia , but less specific because of her baselinelvh. she subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on8/27/96 , revealing a 40% left main with 90% mid rca , 90% stenosis atthe origin of the pda , 30% mid lad , and 50% om2. she subsequentlyunderwent angioplasty of the rca and the pda lesion on 4/14/96 withsome mild haze at the pda. therefore , recommendations were forheparinization for a 24 hour period. she remained pain freethroughout this hospitalization. the eps service saw her regardingthe issue of syncope. further workup was performed includingcarotid ultrasounds which revealed no significant stenosis ineither of the carotid arteries. she underwent a cardiacechocardiogram on 4/28/96 to rule out evidence of regional wallmotion abnormality that might suggest the possibility of a prior mias a source of potential ectopy. she was noted to have 2+ mitralregurgitation , noted to have an ejection fraction of 74% , and hadno reported regional wall motion abnormality. she also had noarrhythmias while on monitors throughout the hospitalization. theeps service agreed with the thought that the ischemia in the rcaprobably was the most likely etiology of her syncopal episodes withpossible bradycardia during ischemic episodes. they favoredholding off on the eps study. they felt that the revascularizationand follow-up stress testing were the recommended workup for thispatient and recommendations are for follow-up ett in four to sixweeks. her medical regimen was adjusted in the form of increasingher lopressor from 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. to 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as herrate and blood pressure tolerated this regimen. she remained painfree throughout the hospitalization. she will have follow-up withher primary m.d.2. diabetes mellitus: her glucose remained under fairly goodcontrol during this hospitalization with her regimen of nph.hemoglobin a1c was checked and is pending at the time of discharge.3. urinary: she was noted to have 3+ bacteria on her urinalysisand 50 , 000 colony forming units on a urine culture of 11/9/96. wewill empirically treat her for a uti with bactrim 1 ds b.i.d. timesthree days.follow-up: follow-up will be with dr. amous she is to have anappointment in one to two weeks. she is also to have afollow-up ett in four to six weeks. she should also have a repeaturine culture in the necton bryin haweir health clinic during her follow-up.discharge medications: enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day ,captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , isordil 40 mgt.i.d. , synthroid .125 micrograms q.day , metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. ,procardia xl 60 mg q.day , nitroglycerin .4 mg p.r.n. , nph insulin66 units q.am and 15 units subcu q.pm , and bactrim 1 ds p.o. b.i.d.times three days.disposition: discharge to home.condition on discharge: good. her diet should be low fat , lowcholesterol ada diet. activity astolerated.complications during hospitalization: none.dictated by: donald l. mclagan , m.d. yp94attending: weston l. siket , m.d. fl49fu216/2662batch: 34199 index
