gradient35 , mean of 21 , and a junctional moderate mr from myxomatousprolapse. cardiac cath at gmh on 0/11/06 showed single-vesselcad involving lad. the patient was initially scheduled toundergo avr , plus mvp and maze on 2/29/06 .  preop chest x-rayrevealed pulmonary fibrosis and mild pulmonary edema , which wasalso confirmed with ct of chest without contrast. pfts weresuggestive of restrictive lung disease. pulmonary service wasconsulted and it is considered that the patient's fibrosis hasnot progressed and that new chest x-ray changes may be likely dueto his interstitial pulmonary edema. it was suggested that therisk of pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery would bemoderate. carotid ultrasound showed 65-70% rca occlusion , whichis asymptomatic. the patient is rescheduled for

postop day #2 , chest tubes removedwires left in. postop day #3 , slow junctional rhythm with ratesin the 40s being externally v paced , rate of 88 and wires notworking. ep states if further rhythm is not recover by postopday #4 to #5 to reconsult. foley reinserted for retention of 400ml output. started flomax. on low-dose coumadin for mvp/maze incase pacemaker was needed. we will need rehabilitation upondischarge. post-day #4 remains to be v paced with junctionalrhythm. the wires are in and do not conduct or capture. epfeels the patient may require pacemaker , we will observe for now.upper extremity noninvasive studies for left greater than rightarm swelling , negative for dvt. holding coumadin pendingpossible pacemaker placement. past video swallow today forregular diet.postop echo pending for mvp. rehabilitation when medicallyready. postop day #5 , postop showed slow junctional rhythm withep following for possible pacemaker , and they set a pacemaker atheart rate of 40. the patient in junctional rhythm/afib , heartrate in the 60s , a wire and do not conduct or capture. v wireset at a backup rate of 40. ep just came by and feels patient islikely recovered conduction. possibly an atrial fibrillationversus accelerated junctional with heart rates in the 80s andthinks pacemaker will not be indicated. plan to discontinuewires in a.m. if the patient's rhythm remain stable.postop echo done for mvp. ef 55% , no comment on mr. foleydiscontinued last night after insertion voiding well today onflomax. low-dose lovenox anticipate eventual discharge torehabilitation on lovenox/coumadin and bridge after pacemaker.white count up slightly to 11.1 low-grade temps. ua negative.rehabilitation when medically ready given possibility ofpacemaker requirement. postop day #6 , spoke with eps as thepatient is in stable sinus rhythm with first-degree av block ,okay to remove wires implanted for pacemaker , ambulating well forroom air. we plan to send to rehab when bed available. postopday #7 , the patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery service tobe stable to discharge to home with vna service with thefollowing discharge instructions.diet:
