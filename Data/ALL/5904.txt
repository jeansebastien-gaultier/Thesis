basilar stroke: patient was transferred to [hospital1 18] on [2199-8-30]for acute stroke. he was treated with merci and intra-arterialtpa: the patient's neuro status was closely monitored. he wastransitioned from a heparin gtt to lovenox given recent embolicstroke and hypercoaguable state in setting of malignancy.  thepatient was cleared for a regular diet after a speech andswallow evaluation.#. right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm: patient s/pmechanical and chemical thrombectomy via right common femoralartery puncture, and was found to have small right commonfemoral artery pseudoaneurysm. he had a repeat ultrasound on[2199-9-6] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increasedin size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only. vascularsurgery was following, and did not feel there was a need forintervention.  the patient's hct remained stable.#. hypoxia: likely secondary to pleural effusions (malignant).cxr on [2199-9-3] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern inright lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stableright pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lunglikely representing increased atelectasis and
