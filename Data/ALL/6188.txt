[name (ni) ] had prodrome ofcold-like symptoms per report. it is unclear what was theprecipitant of the profound weakness / loss of consciousness,but concern exists for cardiac etiology in addition to infection/ sepsis. the patient was not "down" for long (likely << 24h)given absence of profound volume depletion, minimal ckelevation. no evidence of trauma.  he was initially transferredto the icu for treatment.  hospital course is discussed byproblem..id - blood cultures were drawn, negative for growth.  given thepatient's low grade temperature elevation and leukocytosis, aswell as the history of "cold-like" symptoms experienced bypatient, pneumonia was thought to be the most likely source ofinfection.  an initial cxr demonstrated an early pna consistentwith aspiration, so he was started on empiric coverage withvancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl.  the patient went intorespiratory distress secondary to sepsis/pneumonia, and thepatient required intubation.  he was later successfullyextubated. the patient rapidly improved and his lactatenormalized.  his antibiotic coverage was narrowed tolevofloxacin only and finished a seven day course prior todischarge..cv - possible arrhythmic impetus (vt, less likely vf givenperiod on floor) in setting of unknown history of vasculardisease. an ekg demonstrates lbbb, which could be chronic andindicate significant cad.  given his nstemi, with troponin up to>3.0 and an index of 8, cardiology was consulted for furtherrecommendations.  given that the patient was shocked,hypotensive, and septic; this may have all contributed to thetroponin elevation.  he underwent an echocardiogram with reportas follows: 1. the left atrium is mildly dilated.2. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy withnormal cavitysize. overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult toassess but isprobably moderately depressed. overall left ventricular systolicfunctioncannot be reliably assessed.3. the aortic root is mildly dilated.4. the aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.there isprobably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis.5. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. there ismoderatethickening of the mitral valve chordae. at least mild (1+)mitralregurgitation is seen. the mitral regurgitation jet iseccentric. [due toacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may besignificantlyunderestimated.]he was started on a beta-blocker, aspirin, high dose statin, andan ace inhibitor for medical management.  in addition, a heparindrip was administered for 48 hours.  however, a few hours afterthe second dose of captopril, the patient developed severeangioedema with lip and tongue swelling.  the patient was givenepi, benadryl, iv steroids and ranitidine immediately, andanesthesia was consulted for possible intubation, as well as theicu team.  the patient was transferred back to the icu forairway monitoring, but was able to be medically managed withoutintubation.  allergy service was consulted, and felt that thiswas consistent with an ace-i allergy rather than a c-1deficiency.  the c-1 assay was sent to rule out deficiency, withthe results still pending at the time of discharge.  thepatient's pcp was [name (ni) 653], and a follow-up appointment with anoutside cardiologist was arranged prior to discharge.  he wasalso started on norvasc to help optimize his blood pressurecontrol..renal- he was initially in acute renal failure, with acreatinine of 1.8 on admission.  although his baseline wasunknown, it resolved to 1.1.  his foley was discontinued, and heurinated without difficulty.  a microalbumin was sent, which wasnegative, therefore initiating [first name8 (namepattern2) ] [last name (un) ] was deferred by now.according to the allergy service, there is some risk of allergywith [last name (un) ], although very low..endocrine- given that he had a history of "borderline" diabetes,he was monitored with fs qid and covered with an iss,particularly in the setting of steroids for angioedema.  a freet4 was normal, and a urine for microalbumin shows alb/creatinineratio 27.6..heme- he was found to have anemia, normocytic, hct sinceadmission 33-38, then improved to 40.  he was guaiac negative,and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease..he was evaluated by pt and was cleared for a home discharge withservices.  his pcp was [name (ni) 653] prior to discharge, and thepatient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment within oneweek of discharge.medications on admission:excedrindischarge medications:1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).disp:30 tablet(s) refills:22. atorvastatin 80 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).disp:30 tablet(s) refills:23. metoprolol succinate 100 mg tablet sustained release 24hrsig: one (1) tablet sustained release 24hr po daily (daily).disp:30 tablet sustained release 24hr(s) refills:24. amlodipine 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).disp:30 tablet(s) refills:2discharge disposition:home with servicefacility:vna carenetworkdischarge diagnosis:principal:1. multilobar pneumonia.2. septic shock.3. wide complex tachycardia nos.4. non st elevation myocardial infarction.5. acute ace-i angioedema with airway compromise.6. acute renal failure.7. left thalamic and caudate lacunar infarcts - chronic.secondary:1. diabetes mellitus type ii.2. chronic kidney disease stage i.3. hypercholesterolemia.4. hypertension.5. psoriasis.discharge condition:gooddischarge instructions:we have started you on four new medications for your heart.please continue to take these and all of your medications asinstructed.  please call your doctor or return to the hospitalif you develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, fevers orchills.you develop a severe allergic reaction called angioedema whenyou take a medication called ace inhibitors.  please refrainfrom ever taking this type of medication.followup instructions:1. you have a scheduled appointment with dr.
