( 2 ) hypertension; ( 3 ) hypothyroidism;( 4 ) dyslipidemia; ( 5 ) benign prostatic hypertrophy; ( 6 )degenerative joint disease; ( 7 ) non-insulin dependent diabetesmellitus.allergies: the patient has a known allergy to morphine and totetanus toxoid.family history: father died of myocardial infarction at age 66.mother died of myocardial infarction at age 63.social history: no tobacco use. no alcohol use. very activeathletically. he works as a superintendant.physical examination: general appearance , very pleasant manin no apparent distress. temperature97.1 , pulse 103 , blood pressure 148/94 , respirations 18 , o2saturation 97% on two liters. heent pupils are equal , round , andreactive to light. sclerae anicteric. oral pharynx clear andmoist. jugular venous pressure about 8-9 cm. no carotid bruits.chest clear to auscultation and percussion. no rales and nowheezes. heart paradoxical s2 , ii/vi systolic murmur. abdomensoft , nontender , with no pulsatile masses. lower extremities noedema , no cyanosis , or clubbing. rectal examination normal , guaiacnegative. neurological examination grossly intact.admission laboratory studies: sodium 141 , potassium 4.4 ,chloride 101 , bicarb 34 , bun 19 ,creatinine 1.3 , glucose 220 , ast 22 , alk 53 , total bilirubin 0.6 ,calcium 9.8 , total protein 7.1 , albumin 4.4 , magnesium 1.9 , ck 477 ,mb 2.7 , pt 12.7 , inr 1.1 , ptt 24.2. urinalysis 1+ glucose ,otherwise negative.ekg revealed atrial flutter with variable block ( 2:1 versus 3:1 ) ,rate around 120 , left bundle branche block.echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction about 25% with 2+ mitralregurgitation.hospital course: the patient's hospital course was notable for thefollowing: upon transfer from nes hospitalto a hospital the patient had no complaints ofshortness of breath or chest pain. however , the patient was havingatrial flutter with various blocks. the ventricular response atthat time was between 120-130. on the day of admission the patient also hadechocardiogram repeated which revealed ejection fraction 25% with2+ mitral regurgitation.because of his rapid ventricular response , digoxin was started witha loading dose of 0.5 mg , then 0.25 mg times two q. six hours. thepatient was then on a maintenance dose of digoxin at 0.125 mg p.o.q. day , and his digoxin level has been maintained around 0.9. forhis rate control , the amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg q.day , and the patient was started on anticoagulation with heparin.on august the patient underwent cardiac catheterizationwhich revealed old grafts serving the left anterior descending ,posterior descending artery , obtuse marginal , patent. thesaphenous vein graft to first diagonal has 70% proximal stenosis.left ventricular ejection fraction estimated at 10-15%. postcatheterization the patient had no complications. the patient alsohad a tee done which showed no thrombosis. therefore on september the patient underwent cardioversion through his aicd by theelectrophysiological service with successful conversion to normalsinus rhythm. the patient was loaded with coumadin and meanwhileon heparin until inr between 2-3.for further investigation of his cardiomyopathy , iron studies weresent to rule out hemochromatosis. the results were negative.cardiomyopathy consult was also obtained to follow-up the patient.the patient will be discharged when his inr approaches thetherapeutic level , which is between 2-3.discharge medications: amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , captopril25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , clonazepam 1 mg p.o.q. h.s. , klonopin 0.5 mg p.o. q. a.m. , digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. ,lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. , glipizide 5 mg p.o. q.d. , levothyroxinesodium 100 mcg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. q.d. ,lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. , nitroglycerin 1/150 ( 0.4 mg ) one tabsublingual q. five minutes times three , coumadin 5 mg p.o. q. dayuntil inr between 2-3 then the dose needs to be adjustedaccordingly to maintain inr between 2-3 , simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , isosorbide , mononitrate-sr 30 mg p.o. q.d. , and troglipazone400 mg p.o. q. day.condition upon discharge: stable.disposition/follow-up: the patient will be discharged to homeon 10 of august with a follow-upappointment with dr. furbeck , rudy lonny napoleon d. of thecardiomyopathy service.dictated by: bradley wrobliski , m.d.attending: tyson c. accomando , m.d. qg4  nb470/9251batch: 81927 index no. yhir67629f d: 11/10/99t: 1/3/99
