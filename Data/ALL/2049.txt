admission date :01/05/1994discharge date :01/25/1994history of present illness :the patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994 .she was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .the patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .a mammogram done in november 1990 was negative .however , mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .fine needle aspiration on october 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .dr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 , 1991 .the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma .the margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .the left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .estrogen receptor was 0% by erica .the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .therefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast .since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .the patient was treated with cmsap , which is cytoxan , methotrexate , leukovoranrescue , 5-fu , adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles .there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .however , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .abgs showed a po2 of 79 , ph 7.44 , po2 33 .chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , mycoplasma , chlamydia .basically in december 1993 , she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease .she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support .complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .it was treated with gent and cipro .re-staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .in may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine .the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr. wedleung .
