noted to desaturate into the high 80s and he was brought to the the hospital for orthopedics juan for further evaluation .the patient states that he has felt " cloudy " of late which seems to relate to his worsening sob .he is not ambulatory and is very deconditioned secondary to several complications within the past two months related to an aicd pocket infection .he denies any cp , n/v/d ,

lesser degree the rml and lll .2. cxr 2017-09-04compared to pa and lateral chest of the prior day .right-sided picc line with its tip in the distal svc .the heart is markedly enlarged .there remains a large right and small left pleural effusion , not significantly changed .patient remains in congestive heart failure , though it may be slightly improved compared to the prior study .underlying infectious consolidation in the right lower lobe not excluded .3. echo 2017-09-04the left atrium is mildly dilated .there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy .the left ventricular cavity size is normal .lv systolic function appears depressed .resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .right ventricular chamber size is normal and free wall motion may be mildly impaired .the aortic root is mildly dilated .the ascending aorta is mildly dilated .the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .a bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present .the aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally .the transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis .the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .the left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality , with elevated left atrial pressure .transmitral doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with grade iii/iv ( severe ) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction .the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened .there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension .there is no pericardial effusion .compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-08-14 , ventricular function is now similar.ef 35-40% .4. echo 2017-09-14the left atrium is mildly dilated .the left ventricular cavity size is normal .overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed .3l .the aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened .the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened .there is no pericardial effusion .compared with the prior study ( images reviewed ) of 2017-09-04 , there is probably no significant change .all cultures , including bcx , ucx , pleural fluid culture , and wound culture have been negative .5. ct chest 2017-09-16 :1. increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary edema .scattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis .there is no evidence of abscess .6. 2017-09-28 chest x ray :single ap view of the chest .there has been almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .a small right pleural effusion has decreased in size .mild cardiomegaly is stable .there is no pneumothorax .right pic catheter tip ends in the lower svc .patient is post median sternotomy .impression :almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .7. 2017-09-29 ct head :findings :there is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage , mass effect , shift of normally midline structures , or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction .the ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent , but stable in size and appearance .the gray-white matter differentiation is preserved .again seen are subtle hypodensities within the periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic microvascular ischemic changes , stable .extensive carotid artery calcifications are identified .the visualized paranasal sinuses are clear .the surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .impression :no evidence of acute or chronic infarction .stable microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter .8. 2017-09-30 eeg :impression :abnormal eeg due to the moderately slow posterior background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing .these findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures .medications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .no prominent focal abnormalities were evident , and there were no epileptiform features .the cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a paced rhythm .brief hospital course :a/p :70 y/o male with h/o cad , t2dm , hyperlipidemia , and copd who presented to the juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening sob x 5 days from morton hospital & medical center .pt. was initially admitted to ccu on 2017-09-03 , transferred to pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with bp 67/38 and transferred back to ccu on 2017-09-10 .he remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .the following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :1# cardiac :pumpthe patient was initially admitted for likely chf exacerbation .he was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .he continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .while on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .after several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for bps 60s/30s .he was given ivf without an adequate response in his pressures .he was transferred back to the ccu and started on a dopamine gtt .he diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his bp was supported .gradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .however , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .a swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated pad and elevated cvp without an obtainable wedge pressure .he also had a high co and low svr suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated wbc and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .the lasix drip was eventually changed to iv lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .he was then transitioned to oral lasix for maintainence .the patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .it was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .the patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .at discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .his dry weight is 70.4 kg .ischemiathe patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to chf exacerbation .he was continued on aspirin , metoprolol and lipitor with no further issues .rhythmthe patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .he is on amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .his underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .anti-coagulation was started with warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .the patient 's inr became supratherapeutic and coumadin was held .his coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .his inr continued to flucuate .he was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .his inr will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .his inr goal is 02-24 .2# sob on admission :likely due to chf exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 l during his admission .he had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious ivf hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .it appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .on discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as prn nebs and inh copd meds .3# metabolic alkalosis / hypochloremia :etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .this acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an abg revealed a co2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .the patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .his co2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .all sedating medications were held and serial abgs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .4# pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 ml of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .gram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .the right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .repeat cxr showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications5# t2dm :the patient was started on glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .he was monitored with qid fingersticks .his blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .6# hyperlipidemia :the patient was continued on his statin .7# copd :the patient was continued on nebs8# ms changes :the patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .his mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .neurology was also consulted and a head ct showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .an eeg showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .his mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .9# hypothyroidism :the patient was continued on his outpatient dose of levothyroxine .10# ? uti :the patient was started on levofloxacin at newton-wellesley hospital for a question of uti based on u/a positive for wbc .ucx during this hospitalization were negative and levofloxacin was d/c 'd .11# chronic lower back pain :the patient was treated with a lidocaine patch and percocet prn .stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and ms changes .12# wound care :the patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .wound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .for the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .for the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel ag rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .these recommendations were followed throughout the admission .13# voiding :pt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .case was discussed with neurology .he was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .he is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .until then , his foley should remain in place .14# code :the patient was full code during admission .medications on admission :levothyroxine 100 mcg po dailyduloxetine 20 mg po qhsondansetron
