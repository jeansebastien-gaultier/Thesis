[last name (stitle) 1391]and ct surgery dr. __________ it was determined the patientwas not a surgical candidate because of extensive medicalproblems, respiratory problems.  the patient was made dnr,dni.  blood pressure medications were adjusted to stabilizeblood pressure.  the patient was transferred out of the icuto the regular nursing floor on [2133-9-9].  the patient wasdischarged to home with well controlled blood pressurewithout any symptoms.  the patient's creatinine at dischargewas 1.1.  the patient should follow up with the primary carephysician for continued blood pressure monitoring and bloodpressure medication adjustment.  she should call primary careif she develops any chest, back, abdominal pain or nearsyncopal episodes.discharge diagnoses:1. thoracoabdominal aneurysm.2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, o2    dependent, steroid dependent.3. history of coronary artery disease status post    myocardial infarction.4. history of pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic    obstructive pulmonary disease.5. history of transitional cell renal cell carcinoma status    post radical nephrectomy.6. history of spinal canal stenosis status post lumbar    surgery.7. history of gastroesophageal reflux disease.8. history of depression.9. history of steroid myopathy.10.history of carotid stenosis status post left carotid    endarterectomy.11.history of squamous cell anal cancer status post    chemotherapy and radiation therapy.12.status post total abdominal hysterectomy.13.status post appendectomy.14.history of hypertension.15.history of type 2 diabetes noninsulin-dependent,    controlled.16.history of osteoarthritis status post bilateral total    hip replacements.discharge medications:  fluticasone solu-medrol 250/50 mcgdisk b.i.d., tiotropium bromide 18 mcg capsule withinhalation device daily, __________ 10 mg daily, sertraline100 mg daily, trazodone 300 mg at bedtime, propofol sustainedrelease 50 mg daily, prednisone 10 mg daily, gabapentin 300mg b.i.d., gabapentin 600 mg at bedtime, lisinopril 20 mgdaily, spirolactone 25 mg daily, hydralazine 20 mg q.6 h,ativan 0.5 mg tablets q.8 h p.r.n.
