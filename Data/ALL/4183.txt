admission date :2013-04-25discharge date :2013-05-11service :cmed csruhistory of present illness :the patient is a 49 year old man who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit status post cardiac arrest .history was obtained per the emergency department report as well as from the patient 's family .information was very limited regarding the circumstances of his cardiac arrest .reportedly , the patient was at a local restaurant where he was noted to be unresponsive .ems was called and reported to arrive on scene within three minutes .the patient was asystolic but regained a perfusing rhythm after 2 mg of epinephrine and 2 mg of atropine .he was intubated in the field and brought to the emergency department .he remained unresponsive despite the administration of narcan .ct examinations of the head , chest , abdomen and pelvis were all unremarkable .initial chest x-ray showed a left retrocardiac opacity and prominent interstitium though his lung volumes were low .subsequent chest x-ray showed right main stem intubation with left lung collapse which had corrected with withdrawal of the endotracheal tube .the patient was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit for induced hypothermia given his hemodynamic stability , ongoing unresponsiveness and recent out of hospital cardiac arrest .hospital course :cardiac arrest - his arrest was of unknown etiology at the time of admission .no further history was ever gained about his cardiac arrest throughout his hospitalization .ct angiogram had been negative for pulmonary embolism .the patient had an echocardiogram on 2013-04-26 , which showed a normal ejection fraction and trivial mitral regurgitation ; otherwise no obvious abnormalities were seen .given the patient had an out of hospital arrest , remained unresponsive despite hemodynamic stability , he was treated with induced hypothermia and with cold packs and a cooling blanket were placed with goals of reducing his core body temperature to 32 degrees celsius for a period of twelve hours at which point he would be rewarmed over the subsequent six hours .this was done , however , as in problem number two below , we were not successful in any neurologic recovery .neurology - the patient remained unresponsive after the induced hypothermia , the patient was noticed to develop myoclonic jerks and occasional fluttering of his eyelids .electroencephalogram revealed the patient was experiencing persistent seizure activity .neurology was consulted and the patient was treated very aggressively , loaded with multiple drugs , including ativan and propofol drips .the patient continued to demonstrate seizure activity despite this .he was loaded with dilantin and ultimately was treated with a pentobarb coma .after multiple attempts of weaning the pentobarb , the patient was continually reverting to status epilepticus which was never able to be suppressed .infectious disease - over the course of his hospital stay , the patient 's white blood cell count rose to a peak of 17 .multiple cultures were done and the patient was ultimately found to have methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia , pneumonia , and urinary tract infection .for all these infections , the patient was treated with vancomycin and he was also on levofloxacin and flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia at the time of his admission .blood cultures cleared by 2013-05-03 .sputum culture as late as 2013-05-10 , however was still positive for coagulase positive staphylococcus which was methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus .the patient remained gravely ill throughout his hospital stay and had multiple meetings were held with his family with his son being his next of kin .ultimately it was decided that the patient 's wishes would be to not be maintained in a vegetative state and given his poor prognosis ultimately the decision was made to pursue comfort measures only .with these goals of care , the patient expired on 2013-05-11 .the family did consent to a postmortem examination .
