admission date :12/22/2000discharge date :01/01/2001history of present illness :the patient is an 80 female with a history of diastolic function and heart failure , hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis who presents from an outside hospital with presyncope .the patient reports dizziness intermittently times several months now increasing in frequency described as episodes where she feels faint .the room spins with no visual changes , no loss of consciousness , no palpitations or chest pain , no shortness of breath or diaphoresis .on the day of admission , the patient was with some friends , rose from a chair to leave and felt dizzy while ambulating , fell and hit elbow with minor head trauma .the patient denied loss of consciousness , no bowel or bladder incontinence .the patient was transferred to an outside hospital where she was noted to have a 50 point discrepancy in her upper extremity blood pressures , right greater than left .this had been noted in the outpatient setting approximately one to two years prior to admission .the patient had no mediastinal widening on chest x-ray , but was transferred to verg medical center for further evaluation .in the emergency room , the patient &apos;s temperature was 98.8 degrees , heart rate 73 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 98% on room air .blood pressure in the left arm demonstrated 125/89 , blood pressure in the right arm was 177/119 .the patient had a systolic murmur 3/6 that radiated to the carotids with a decreased left radial pulse per the emergency room .the patient had a chest ct scan demonstrating no dissection or evidence of congestive heart failure .she received nitropaste , aspirin , laboratory studies and was taken to the floor for further management .the patient denies melena , bright red blood per rectum , no emesis , or fevers or chills .the patient has a history of anemia as per past medical history above .review of systems :otherwise negative .hospital course :1 ) cardiovascular :the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .she remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .the patient was maintained on her aspirin and lasix .the patient &apos;s diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .the patient also underwent an adenosine mibi stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .at this time , the patient &apos;s presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .2 ) neurological / vascular :the discrepancy in the patient &apos;s pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .the patient underwent mri / mra of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .the left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .the patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck mra .mri of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .the patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .the patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .the results of these studies suggested that the patient &apos;s symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .a neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient &apos;s intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .3 ) orthopedic :the patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .an orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with physical therapy assistance .a bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .at the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of physical therapy and a walker .plans were made for the patient to be discharged to dwardmegriff rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .4 ) gastrointestinal :the patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .the patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .the patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .however , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .the patient &apos;s emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .the etiology of the patient &apos;s nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .the patient was started on meclizine on december 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .an attempt was also made to reduce the patient &apos;s large number of medications and the patient &apos;s os-cal , multivitamin , lasix and colace were discontinued .5 ) infectious disease :the patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on december 30 , 2000 .urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .the patient was started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .the urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .6 ) fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :the patient had a mild increase in her bun and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .the patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .
