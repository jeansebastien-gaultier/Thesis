with alactate 2.1.  at [hospital1 18] patient was responsive to ivf and weanedoff levophed.   most likely septic given mild hypothermia, wbc17.3 and neutrophilia, hypoxia, and ct chest finding c/wpneumonia.  while it is possible that the leukocytosis may besecondary to prednisone, the prednisone may also be masking afever.  treated empirically with vanc, zosyn with rapidimprovment. there may have also been a component of hypovolemiain setting of decreased oral intake at [hospital1 1501] given response toivf.  pt has only been on short taper of prednisone so lesslikely adrenal insufficiency although did receive hydrocortisoneat osh.  pt with elevated troponin but less likely cardiogenicshock - may more likely represent end organ damage fromhypoperfusion; no evidence of chf and bp unlikely to reverse soquickly.  he was never again hypotensive on the floor and hiswhite count resolved with iv abx.  we were never 100% convincedthat this was from pneumonia and a foot ct was checked prior todischarge to r/o osteomyelitis which showed no evidence ofosteomyelitis. all cultures were negative..plan going forward:-complete 14day course of broad spectrum abx (last day [5-28])-patient must have cxr in 1 month to f/u for complete resolutionof his pna/r/o underlying malignancy..# hypoxia: patient quickly weaned from nrb to nc to room air.this was likely related to pneumonia, though volume overloadfrom resuscitation can not be excluded, or any contribution fromhis underlying lung disease..# cad: nl ck but elevated trop likely represents demand insetting of arf and hypoperfusion rather than an occlusivelesion. the patient peaked and ruled out on labs in house. ekgwas paced and c/w prior.  per son, recent stress testunremarkable..# dm: patient had issues with o/n low blood sugars, [last name (un) ] wasconsulted, we dialed back his pm humalog and lantus and hisblood sugar control optimized..# anemia: hct here 25.5, was 32.3 at osh.  pt is on asa andplavix
