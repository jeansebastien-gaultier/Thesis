aroutine cbc. he initially sought care from his pcp after he hadnoticed that he had noticed increased bleeding from the site ofa removed childhood skin tumor which had been severely pruritic,causing him to scratch it with a sharp back-scratcherrepeatedly. the pcp felt the patient had an infected cyst andstarted abx. his pcp drew [name initial (pre) ] cbc which showed 66% atypical whitecells and thrombocytopenia with a normal white cell count andhematocrit. he then ordered immunophenotyping which is pending,and sent the patient to the ed. on review of systems, thepatient also notes more

alkphos-68totbili-1.0brief hospital course:78 yo male with distant history of stable angina, new diagnosisof acute promyelocytic leukemia, transferred to the icu withtachycardia after atra treatment on the hematology malignancyfloor, with dic, pulmonary edema, and delirium..# apml: he was diagnosed with apml with 56% blasts ondifferential [2174-3-18]. he was treated with atra and subsequentlysuffered from atra syndrome with an acute elevation in his wbcto >50 k. he had significant pulmonary leak. he was treated withatra throughout and received idarubicin which had to be stoppedsecondary to elevated bilirubin. his blasts and wbc subsequentlydecreased, and on smear [2174-4-4] his myelocytes showeddifferentiation with improving status of his leukemia. atra wascontinued throughout his hospitalization. as a consequence oftreatment, his course was complicated by tumor lysis syndromewith his uric acid peaking above 10, with a change an increasein creatinine to 2.5 initially and subsequently higher asdescribed below. he was treated with allopurinol initially, andrequired a 1x dose of rasburicase which led to the resolution ofhis tls. he was maintained on his allopurinol for continuedtreatment..# respiratory failure: likely multifactorial in the setting ofpulmonary leak from atra and likely alveolar hemorrhage. hisfluid balance reached a peak of 27l positive secondary to hisblood product requirement. he initially required a peep of 22with fio2 of 100%. over the course of 10 days he was able to beweaned down with the assistance of cvvh for fluid overload topressure support of [5-19]. his mental status was the largestobstacle to extubation and he was taken for tracheotomy tubeplacement by thoracic surgery on [2174-4-8]. he tolerated theprocedure well, and was able to be transitioned to trach collarstarting on [2174-4-10] for periods of time..# dic: due to his apml, he developed dic evidenced by activebleeding from his et tube, his og tube, his stool and urine. hehad acute drops in fibrinogen, increase in ldh and increase inbilirubin. he was supported through this with massivetransfustions requiring 18 units of prbcs, 35 units ofplatelets, 5 units of ffp, and 24 units of cryoprecipitate. hewas intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on[2174-3-26]. his cxr after intubation showed a fluffy infiltratesuggestive of either ards or hemorrhage (likely both). due tohis subdural hematomas, he was transfused to goals of hct>30,plts > 100, fibrinogen > 175, and inr <1.6. once the dicresolved, his goals changed to hct>25, plts > 20, fibrinogen >100, and inr <1.6..# toxic metabolic encephalopathy: he started experiencing adecline in mental status 2 days prior to intubation with severeasterixis and confusion. he had a number of potential causessuch as medications, central focus with his sdh, andhypertension to 180 making pres a less likely, but possibleconcern. also, his uremia given his acute renal failure. herequired several doses of haldol and intermittent restraints forsafety prior to intubation, when he was put on midazolam andfentanyl drips. 5 days after intubation his was sedation wasdiscontinued and he remained obtunded. he was treated withdialysis for a uremia over 200. his mental status was thebarrier to extubation as his vent setting were minimal at thepoint of weaning sedation. he was non responsive after 4 daysoff of sedation. a family meeting was held with his husband[name (ni) ], and the decision was made to take him to trach, with thegoal of trying to improve his mental status with dialysis.# acute renal failure: his creatinine sharply rose from 1.2 onadmission to a peak of 4.9. this was thought to be in thesetting of tumor lysis syndrome (tls) and abdominal compartmentsyndrome. also complicated by atn in the setting of low bloodvolume and possible microthrombi during dic. he was treatedallopurinol and rasburicase for tls with good resolution as wellas with cvvh initially (1 day) for fluid removal. his urineoutput responded. shortly after he began autodiuresing he wasinitiated on dialysis for ams as described above and a bun ofgreater than 200. he was treated with dialysis with a fall inbun to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures cameback positive for gpc in chains from dialysis catheter [2174-4-9]..# abdominal compartment syndrome: in the setting of acute volumeoverload from large volume transfusions given dic as above. hewas ~25l positive for los fluid balance. he developed elevatedbladder pressures and decreased urine output. surgery wasconsulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there wasno need for surgical intervention (as well as given his criticalillness, it was not indicated). he was started on cvvh as aboveand had 3l removed. his kidneys responded and began making100-200cc/hr of urine. his cvvh was stopped and he was allowedto diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone asneeded..# atrial fibrillation / flutter: he developed tachycardia to the140s with initial ekg most consistent with afib, and later ekgmore consistent with aflutter vs avnrt.  his hr did not respondto diltiazem drip or multiple subsequent iv boluses of diltiazemand metoprolol.  cardiology suggested verapamil, followed byamiodarone.  he was loaded with amiodarone drip and bolus of 150mg x2.  he was cardioverted on [2174-3-22] and continued onamiodarone.  he got an extra 150mg of amiodarone on [3-25] withminimal effect on tachycardia. he converted to nsr, and revertedback to atrial fibrillation. in the setting of controlling hisblood pressure with iv medications he received multiple doses ofmetoprolol and labetalol, and he converted to nsr. however, [4-1]he converted back to rapid a-fib with rvr and requireduptitration of his b-blockade and a diltiazem drip which waseventually converted back to po..# bilateral subdural hematomas: unclear time course.neurosurgery followed along and he had serial scans. hishematomas had interval increased in the setting of the dic;however, not thought to be clinically significant. neurosurgerypreferred medical management with antiepileptics and reversal ofhis coagulopathy..# right basal ganglia infarct: on repeat scan of his head toevaluate interval change of his subdural hematomas on [2174-4-4], anew right sided basal ganglia infarct was noted. neurosurgeryfollowed, and neurology was consulted. they felt that medicalmanagement and blood pressure control were the best means oftreatment..# positive blood cultures: blood cultures were positive in [2-16]bottles from his picc line on [2174-3-22].  the aerobic culture wasspeciated as staph aureus.  no peripheral culture was obtainedon that date.  he was started on vancomycin / meropenem on[2174-3-22] after spiking a fever to 102.5.  this was changed tovancomycin / cefepime the next day.  given the concern fortranslocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immunesystem, he was switched to vancomycin / zosyn on [2174-3-24] forbetter coverage of gut pathogens.  micafungin was added to coverfor fungal pathogens. he had multiple sets of negativesurveillance cultures, and his antibiotics were continued whilehe remained neutropenic. he had a fever to 100.6 on [2174-4-9] andcultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which werepositive for gpcs in chains. his catheter was pulled and he wascontinued on vancomycin..# pericardial fat pad: on echo on [2174-3-24] there was concern forpericardial effusion because the echo showed a new anteriorpericardial effusion with complex echodensity.  no evidence oftamponade physiology was seen on the echo.  his repeat echoshowed that the effusion was actually a fat pad..# alcoholism/cirrhosis: he was known to drink a bottle ofalcohol per night. he initially required 10 mg iv diazepamseveral times and started on a ciwa scale.  on ruq imaging forpersistent elevation of his bilirubin, cirrhosis was noted. morethan likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he hadpoor clearance of his bilirubin (from reabsorption from pooledblood)..# elevated glucose: he initially had glucose's in the 400??????s inthe setting of getting steroids. his insulin coverage wasbriefly switched to an insulin drip, and he was subsequentlyconverted to subcutaneous insulin based on his requirements.# goals of care: pt remained in coma. his overall clinicalstatus continued to decline over the course of hospitalization,with evolution of multi-system organ failure including increasedpulmonary ventilatory requirements, persistant renal failure,lfts continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia(initially mssa, then vre). he was given 1 dose of daptomycinfor vre coverage. given his multiple organ failure, worseningventilatory requirements and persistent altered mental status, afamily meeting was held and decision made to focus efforts onpatient comfort beginning [2174-4-12] am. the patient quietlyexpired on [2174-4-14] with family at the bedside.medications on admission:- metformin 500mg [hospital1 ]- metoprolol tartrate 50mg [hospital1 ]-
