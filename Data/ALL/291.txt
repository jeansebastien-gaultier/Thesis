however,there was also concerning lv ballooning and inducible ishemia.because of these results, he was thought to be high cardiac riskand was kept in house for cardic catheterization. thesignificiant risk of kidney failure and life-long dialysis wasdiscussed prior to cardiac catheterization. the patient decidedto undergo the risk with full informed consent. cardiaccatheterization did not demonstrate significant coronary arterydisease. he was medically managed with asa,bb,[last name (un) ], statin andhis medication doses were adjusted as indicated. egddemonstrated signficiant esophagitis and this was thought to bethe cause of his chest pain. given a h/o allergy to lidocaine,he did not receive magic mouthwash and was started onsucralfate. he will f/u with gi. his ppi was changed toranitidine [12-30] ?effect on his acute renal failure..anemia: he has a baseline anemia due to ckd. the patientreported that just prior to moving his care to [location (un) 86] that eposhots had been started where not currently being administered.two days after egd his hct dropped from 32 to 28 to 27. his hctremained stable at 28 and then rose again. he was guiacnegative, but it is most likely that he had some mild gibleeding. because of the this hct drop and becauseanticoagulants are given during cardiac cath, cardiac cath wasdefered until his hct stabilized. pt was then started on procritand will receive weekly injections..htn: uncontrolled while hospitalized, partly because nottolerating all of his po medications at the begining of hishospital course.  his valsartan and bb were uptitrated toachieve better control but valsartan was again decreased [12-30]renal failure. his beta-blocker was limited by bradycardia inthe icu and then hr 60-70 on the floor. clonidine was startedand he will take this in patch form..acute on chronic renal failure: the creatinine remained atbaseline 2-2.4 throughout his hospital course but day aftercatheterization and after having received adquate hydration,sodium bicarbonate and mucomyst pt's creatinine jumped to peak3.3.  it weas thought to be secondary to contraste dye versushis ppi has he had high eosinophilia. he was changed back toranitidine. he was seen by the renal consult team and will seedr.
