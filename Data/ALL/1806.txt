vigorously hydrated for pancreatitis and had few complications.in setting of her increased abdominal distension and developmentof pleural effusion as well as sudation for ethanol withdrawal sherequired intubation. throughout her intensive care unit admissionshe had a high fever. an abdominal ct with iv contrast on november , 1997 , was negative for pancreatic necrosis and no tapable

from her lines which were changed as well as xanthomonasmaltophilia for which she received bactrim. at the time of hertransfer from the intensive care unit to the general medicalservice she was usually linked with a baseline heart rate in the120's and a systolic blood pressure in the 90's. the plan was torestart her at low doses of a ace inhibitor for after loadreduction , as tolerated. with careful surveillance of her fluidstatus and maintenance of weight between 73 and 74 kilograms.pulmonary wise she was treated for seven days with bactrim for thexanthomonas infection as well as chest
