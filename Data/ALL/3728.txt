(lvot dimension=1.8 cm.)  (lvot velocity=1.06 m/s.)  the peak velocity was obtained from the apical 5 chamber view.  there is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency.  the left ventricular cavity size is small.  the left  ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.  there is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  there are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  the estimated ejection fraction is

woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   in addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, lv function, could consider stress test--will consult ep to assess pacer function--pt has already ruled out for mi but will keep her on monitor at least overnight--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent --will re-check carotid
