(he is not on coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol xl 12.5mg only.)  cxr by report was clear.  with admiodarone, bps dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, bps back up to 80s, then 90s.  of note, he says his baseline hr is 80s and sbp is 90s.review of systemsnegative in detail except as noted otherwise above.past medical/surgical history: cad, h/o stemi 2077, 8 stents including lad at least x2, biv/icd placement 2 weeks ago, last cath duluth 2 weeks with &#8220;multivessel disease not amenable to cabg&#8221;biv/icd (ddd, st. jude promote rf, 5/13/81)chfdmhtnformer tobaccorecent diagnostic studiestte, 11/04/2077:la dil, lv: wma anterior, septal, apical, no thrombus, delayed relaxation, ef 35%, rv nlinterventional lhc, 10/2077: successful stenting of the proximal lad with a3.5 x 15 and 3.0 x 15 mm vision stents.lhc, 10/2077:dominance: rightleft main: normal.lad: diffuse, irregular, and thrombotic 90 % stenosis in its  proximal third.  d1: focal 90 % stenosis in its ostiumramus: focal 95 % stenosis in its  ostium. both the 1st diagonal and ramus side branches arise from the thrombotic proximal lad segment.cx/rca: minimal irregularitiesfamily history: heart disease on both mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s side, but no early cad in 1st degree relatives. htn and hl on both sides.social history: retired purchasing agent.  quit smoking a few years ago, had smoked 1-2ppd since youth.  no etoh, illicits.allergies/adverse reactions: history of ?digoxin toxicity as abovemedications on admission:   1. acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)  325 mg po qam  2. esomeprazole (nexium)  40 mg po qd  3. glipizide  10 mg po bid  4. metformin  500 mg po bid  5. omega-3-fatty acids (fish oil capsule)  1200 mg po qd  6. furosemide (lasix)  20 mg po qod  7. nicotinic acid extended release (niacin extended release)  500 mg po qd  8. metoprolol succinate extended release (toprol xl)  12.5 mg po qpm  9. lisinopril  10 mg po qpm10. simvastatin  20 mg po qamphysical examination vitals: t 96.8 / hf 133 / bp 112/65 / rr 18 / o2 96% rageneral &#8211;
