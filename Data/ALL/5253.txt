normal(lvef>55%). due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wallmotion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. tissue dopplerimaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure(pcwp<12mmhg). right ventricular chamber size and free wallmotion are normal. the aortic root is mildly dilated at thesinus level. the aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurallynormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.the mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitralregurgitation. there is no mitral valve prolapse. there isborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

with acute renal failure..# lethargy: concern for viral syndrome, including activation ofcmv, or a respiratory virus. he has been known ebv+ in the past.this could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he hasbeen having, and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonarywork-up in parallel with the infectious work-up. in the icu,continued broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin and aztreonam(given allergy).  infectious workup largely negative includingcmv vl, respiratory panel, ebv vl, fungal markers, bloodcultures, urine cultures, ct chest. pt's lethargy improved withivfs, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. did not ever needpressors..# dyspnea/cough: concern for infectious process. regarding vte,his risk should be reduced with therapeutic inr, though theconcern for coumadin failure merits consideration, though wouldbe unlikely and he has no other signs and symptoms of dvt. pftscompleted [9-9], with official report pending at time of thissummary. ct chest showing

steroidsresponsive. initially given stress dose steroids with plans toresume home dose.  also given ivf repletion. bps normalized.likely etiology was slight adrenal insufficiency in setting ofviral syndrome despite negative infectious workup. patientdischarged with prednisone 7.5 mg daily..# acute renal failure: likely pre-renal azotemia. improved withivfs. cr 0.9 on discharge..# mild epigastric/ruq tenderness: no laboratory e/o hepatitis.ruq us showing polyp at neck of gallbladder (1.2cm), which wasalso seen on prior ultrasound scan [2145-2-9]. no other findingsto explain
