record date: 2076-08-23pmh internal medicine associates          william-nuel, kelli                                              89897856                                              8-23-76   hpi: mrs. william-nuel is a 61-year old patient of mine who carries a diagnosis of essential hypertension and comes in today for a routine checkup. patient appears to be doing fine. she has been compliant with her antihypertensive regimen, which consists of nifedipine and also hydrochlorothiazide. since our last meeting, the patient has lost approximately 15 to 20 pounds. she has been exercising on a daily basis and eating very well, both of which have had very, very significant and beneficial results on her blood pressure and pressure today on examination was 120/80 in both arms. the patient was complaining of some ankle swelling, and in looking through her medicines i noted that she had been on furosemide, which was a holdover from the time of her most recent admission. i quickly switched to furosemide to hydrochlorothiazide, which i feel would give her much better diuretic response and relief of her symptoms over the next few days.  the final issue with the patient today is low back pain, which she has had chronically for the last several years after suffering a fall in 2065. we have tried a whole host of conservative measures, which have included bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and back exercises. the patient is referred now to the paoli memorial hospital spinal clinic for services to obtain further help, and hopefully treatment, of her pain. treatment recommendations from the spinal clinic will be forthcoming. patient is scheduled to follow up with me again in two to three months. addendum: the issue of her annual screening was addressed also and patient agreed to have her cholesterol checked today, but does not want to have either a mammogram or a pap smear. she complains that she does not have faith in these procedures and that this is something that she is not used to and does not want to have done. i attempted to discuss the need and why it is necessary to undergo continued screening and will continue to do this with the patient in the future, but for now, the patient adamantly refuses either of the two examinations.    _________________________quinton lovett, m.d.  pu:zt:1220/0612dd:8-23-76dt:8-24-76dv:8-23-76  approved but not reviewed by provider
