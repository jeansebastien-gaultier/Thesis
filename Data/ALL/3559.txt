had labs that weresignificant for inr of 20.2 with ptt of 71.4, hct of 37.7 at herbaseline. she underwent ct scan of the head and c-spine withoutany abnormality and ct scan of abdomen and pelvis without acutepathology. patient was t&c and received 2 units of ffp. her vswere stable throughout the er course. she was admitted to theicu for hemodynamic monitoring. gi was not called from the er.pt was recently hospitalized at [hospital1 18] on [2121-3-28] for rightfacial and upper lip angioedema, as well as a recent fall.  pt'sdaughter reports she was confused and altered from her baselinemental status on day prior to admission.  angiogedema improvedsignificantly with iv solumedrol and h1,h2 blockers.  a brainmri was obtained due to h/o altered mental status in setting offall, and was notable for an acute left caudate head infarct.mra of the neck demonstrated a 50% stenosis of the left proximalinternal carotid artery and 50% stenosis in both vertebralarteries in the v2 segment. the tte on [2121-3-31] was negative formural thrombus or cardiac source, but etiology of stroke feltmost likely cardioembolic in setting of subtherapeutic inr.  ptwas discharged in stable condition to rehab.  on [2121-4-12], ptreturned to [hospital1 18] ed with transient dizziness, r arm and faceweakness.  head ct was negative for bleed, and neuro felt mosther presentation was most likely due to recrudescence of priorcaudate infarct in setting of mild dehydration.past medical history:- left caudate head infarct- angioedema: pruritis and periorbital and lip/tongue edema,previously intubated in micu ([12-16]), etiology thought to be dueto lisinospril, which was subsequenlty discontinued. recurrencein [3-19] requiring micu admission, managed with iv steroids
