admission date :4/28/93discharge date :5/15/93history of present illness :the patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .the patient was in a good state of health until january of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .she had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .a work up begun by her internist , dr. brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .she was admitted to box memorial hospital nursing home for further evaluation .data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .the liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , ldh 310 , sgot 66 , albumin 2.5 .a peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .chromosomal studies were negative .a bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .a thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .this was followed by an abdominal ct which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .an upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .the small bowel follow through was within normal limits .a thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .a chest ct also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .the patient was subsequently referred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital under the service of dr. brain .she continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .she also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .a needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .the patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .hospital course :the patient was admitted to dr. shatermivaet s brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .accordingly , an oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .this revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .a lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .during this time the patient &apos;s coagulation status had improved with vitamin k therapy with pts normalizing .anca serum results were negative .ana results were also nonsuggestive .the patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a vascular radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .there was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .a head ct was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .meanwhile , the patient &apos;s eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .she also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .the conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .dr. trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .on 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .she underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .she was received in the respiratory intensive care unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .her rate was well controlled on digoxin .the patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .on the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as solu-medrol therapy .calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .she continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .she continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with coumadin .she was effectively anticoagulated with a pt in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .she also received a radiation therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .she did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
