record date: 2150-09-28urology admission note as per dr. nesmith&#8217;s note, detailed below, mr. eubanks is a 69 year-old male with nephrolithiasis. he underwent cystoscopy, selective cytologies, bilateral retrograde pyeloureterogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone extraction, stent, and bladder biopsies on 9/27/50. post-operatively he experienced urinary retention and a catheter was placed without difficulty. he was advised he could safely return home, but he was sleepy and his wife expressed distress over looking after the catheter. he was therefore admitted.history of present illness:   69 yo male noted to have a 10mm distal left uvj stone during an evaluation for gross hematuria.  no history of urinary tract infections and previous stones.past medical history:  cad -
