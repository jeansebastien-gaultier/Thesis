admission date :07-30-93discharge date :08-10-93history of present illness :the patient is a 47 year old patient of dr. laymie fournier and dr. leebjescobe in co in saorlirv frea , west virginia who was well until a bout of double pneumonia in may 1992 , at which time he was hospitalized at centdick naco hospital medical center .he also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus .he had a transient episode of headache and disorientation at that time .a ct and mri scan corroborated multiple cerebral infarcts .he was started on aspirin .he has a family history of hypertension as well .he was also placed on vasotec .a holter monitor showed ventricular ectopy .a thallium stress test showed tachycardia and severe dyspnea as well as a fall in blood pressure with low level exercise .an echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis .accordingly he was referred for further evaluation .hospital course :the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory , where he was noted initially to have a pulmonary wedge pressure of 45 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 82/40 .this lowered with iv nitroglycerin .selective coronary angiography showed an occluded right coronary artery in its midportion .he had an 80% distal left main , a 90% proximal circumflex , and multiple significant lesions in the lad .his left ventricle ejection showed diffuse hypokinesis .the situation was reviewed with his wife , sligh .she noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the leigh and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .it was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on iv heparin .he stabilized over the weekend .he was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on holter monitor .he developed epigastric pain on 07/31 which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .he also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .he had some further anterolateral st segment changes .therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .the patient was seen in consultation by the electrophysiology service , dr. slusslashgodle , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .on 08/02/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , dr. thorebreutz took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .he had a left internal mammary artery graft of the lad , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .a paraphimosis was noted and treated by dr. ryna jescdrig .after surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .he was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .he had good hemodynamics .he had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .his intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the surgical intensive care unit .he was seen in consultation by the nutrition service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .on 08/05 it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous heparin and indeed , when heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to heparin .he remained in normal sinus rhythm .he did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .he had a right bundle branch block .he is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ace inhibitors , digoxin , coumadin , and aspirin .therefore he was able to be discharged home .he understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in grovea co terburgperv portnew .
