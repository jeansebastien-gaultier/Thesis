( increased from 120 mg b.i.d. on1/26/04 ).2. imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. started on 5/15/04.3. toprol-xl 12.5 mg p.o. q. day.4. coumadin as needed for inr of 2 to 3.5. glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.6. niferex 150 mg p.o. q. day.7. allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.the following medications have been stopped recently:1. ace inhibitor ( for hyperkalemia ).2. zocor.physical examination: temperature 96.7 , pulse 95 , blood pressure140/66 , respirations 20 , saturation 83% on room air up to 90% on2 liters. the patient was in no apparent distress at rest , buthad mild shortness of breath with repositioning. his jvp was 13to 14 cm. he had crackles bilaterally , one-third of the way uphis lungs. heart was regular rate and rhythm , 2/7 left uppersternal border murmur. abdomen: obese , nontender , nondistended ,normoactive bowel sounds. he had a left below the kneeamputation , which was warm and clean. right leg was fullyintact , but there is severe crusting of the skin of the leg fromthe knee down , very swollen right foot with skin intact and nopalpable pulses.laboratories: sodium 139 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 101 ,bicarbonate 30 , bun 71 , creatinine 1.7 , glucose 125. bnp was473 , digoxin 0.8 , albumin 3.7. white blood cell count 6.2 ,hematocrit 39.8 , platelets 122 , 000 , inr 3.0 , ptt 68.9. chestx-ray showed small bilateral effusions and enlarged cardiacsilhouette. ekg left bundle-branch block with no peaked t waves ,normal sinus rhythm , t-wave inversion in i , l , v5 , v6 ( whichrepresent repolarization abnormality because they are asymmetric ,consistent with lvh although it does not meet formal lvhcriteria ).hospital course:1. cardiovascular:a. ischemia: the patient had no clear evidence of ischemia , butgiven his symptoms , the troponin was checked and that wasnegative.b. pump: the patient was felt to be volume overloaded. hisadmission weight was 130 kg. he was started on iv lasix fordiuresis and began to diurese well putting out approximately 2 to3 liters negative per day. he had a right heart catheterizationwhich showed right atrial pressure 16 , pulmonary artery pressureof 66/26 with a mean of 42 , mean wedge pressure of 25 suggestinghigh left-sided and right-sided filling pressures. cardiacoutput was 7.83 , cardiac index was 3.09 , svr was 695 , pvr was174. therefore , the patient was felt to still be volumeoverloaded and was diuresed further. at the time of thisdictation , his weight has dropped to 118 kg from 130 onadmission.from the perspective of blood pressure , he was started onhydralazine and isordil to reduce his afterload and these weretitrated up with the goal systolic blood pressure of less than120.c. rhythm: the patient had atrial fibrillation and he was kepton coumadin with a goal inr of 2 to 3 except when he was beingprepped for his right heart cath. he is now being restarted oncoumadin following the cath with the goal inr of 2 to 3.2. pulmonary: the patient seemed to have several possiblecauses for his shortness of breath including volume overload andhis underlying copd and body habitus. an arterial blood gas wasdone with 2 liters nasal cannula on 10/11/04 and this showed phof 7.28 , co2 of 76 , oxygen of 67 , and bicarbonate of 37. this ison 2 liters nasal cannula giving an a-a gradient of 16. comparedto his prior abg in march 2003 , which showed ph 7.43 , carbondioxide of 52 , and oxygen of 60 with a bicarbonate of 37. thissuggested that the patient was hypoventilating. therefore , hewas started on bipap overnight and he said that his sense ofcomfort of breathing improved following bipap. at this point , hewill be sent home on home bipap.3. chest x-ray showed small- to moderate-sized bilateraleffusions , which were confirmed on a chest ct. however , becausethe patient was still volume overloaded and seemed to beimproving with diuresis , a pleural tap was not attempted.4. dermatological: the patient had severe skin thickening fromhis lymphedema. dermatology was consulted for proper care of hislegs. they were initially concerned that there could have been asuperimposed cellulitis and the patient was initially started onlevofloxacin; however , there do not appear to be significantclinical evidence of cellulitis and therefore , the levofloxacinwas discontinued after two days. dermatology made specificrecommendations for care specifically , one-quarter strengthdakin's soaks b.i.d. moist-to-dry on the legs followed bybetamethasone cream and lac-hydrin cream mixture twice a day.there is also an indurated plaque on the right bridge of thepatient's nose for which dermatology performed a shave biopsy forconcern of a basal cell carcinoma versus a squamous cellcarcinoma. this showed endophytic squamous proliferation withatypia although the basal layer was not fully represented. thiswas potentially the most superficially portion of a squamous cellcarcinoma and deeper sampling was required for more definitivediagnosis. deeper sampling has not yet occurred at this point.5. urology: the patient was noted to have a blood-tinged urineoutput into his foley. initially , this was dark red; however ,this lightened significantly. there are also some clots evident.the foley was removed and the patient was able to urinate on hisown; however , his urine is still tinged with blood although itappears to have lightened up. further followup will be requiredlikely with urology as an outpatient.6. endocrine: the patient has diabetes mellitus , type 2 , whichis well controlled after his recent weight loss. he wasmaintained on glipizide and lispro sliding scale.7. renal: the patient has chronic renal insufficiency secondaryto his diabetes mellitus. we avoided contrast dye. thepatient's creatinine has not increased during the diuresisprocess going from 1.7 on admission to 1.7 on 7/18/04.the discharge medications and instructions will be dictated as anaddendum at the time of discharge.escription document: 5-2098339 issten telcc: dong munsterman m.d.cragoson balt cleveandtopelakefallspines atlporti acc: hilton duffie m.d.rell hospitalettegilb heightsnash chunahclellmorn hwy. , talake , massachusetts 13195dictated by: arnst , greggattending: cidre , quincydictation id 6021852d: 2/8/04t: 2/8/04[report_end]
