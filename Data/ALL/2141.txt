procedure:pleurex catheterhistory of present illness:pt is a [age over 90 ] year old woman with pmh of stage iv nsclc, cva, and arecurrent malignant right sided pleural effusion who presentedafter attempted ip procedure on day of admission with alteredmental status and an unresponsive episode.  pt was scheduled foroutpatient pleuroscopy, pleurodesis, and pleurx catheterplacement today.  she was prepped and received 75mcg of fentanyland 1.5 mg total of midazolam.  an incision was made, but atthat time the patient became unresponsive with bradycardia intothe 30s and hypotension with sbps in the 60s.  she requiredventilatory support with a bvm briefly, got atropine 0.5mg x 2and the procedure was aborted (and small incision suturedclosed).she was given flumazenil 0.5mg as well as narcan 0.4mg withminimal response.  she was not respondingverbally/appropriately. she was withdrawing to painful stimuliand moving all extremities.  at the time of this incident, anekg was performed that showed atrial fibrillation and stdepressions (reportedly in v2-v3).  repeat ekg 30 minutes latershowed normalization of these abnormalities.prior to the procedure she reported cough, dyspnea, and weightloss. she specifically denied orthopnea, pnd or leg edema.of note, she has had thoracentesis x  2 on [1-26] and [2-27] draining850ml and 1300ml respectively. post procedure her dyspneaimproved and there was complete lung expansion.on the floor, the patient is responsive to painful stimuli only.review of systems:unable to obtain due to patient's mental status.past medical history:1. cva2.

(post pleurex):no evidence of residual pneumothorax.brief hospital course:# altered mental status: the patient's unresponsiveness/alteredmental status was possibly due to versed/fentanyl with slowmetabolism, but also possibly due to hypoxia and resultant cnsinsult that occurred as a result of her hypoperfusion with lowhr and blood pressure.  alternative explanations include cva andother toxic/metabolic abnormalities. glucose level was normal.as this change in level of consciousness was so acute, lesslikely due to infection/sepsis.  patient also with long historyof atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation with aninr of 1.2. the patient was admitted to the sicu under the careof the micu team.  her airway was monitored closely and she hada repeat abg that showed 7.4/65/127.  she did not receive anyfurther opiates/benzodiazepines.  her mental status was waxingand [doctor last name 688], and she would have periods throughout the nightwhere she would open her eyes and follow simple commands(squeeze hands).  otherwise, she was responsive only to painfulstimuli.  an mri of her brain was performed due to concern forembolic cva which showed no acute pathology.  she did receiveflumazenil 0.5mg again along with narcan 0.4mg.  approximatelyone hour after the administration of these medicines, thepatient was fully awake, alert and oriented. on the dayfollowing admission, she was able to converse with her family(present at bedside) although she frequently reported feeling"tired."  she later tolerated her ip procedure well and wasalert on discharge.# hypotension: when the patient first arrived to the icu, herblood pressures were in the high 90s and low 100s systolic.over the subsequent several hours, her blood pressures drifteddown to a nadir of 70s systolic. she received 2 iv fluid bolusesof 500ml.  she showed improvement in her blood pressure to90s-100s.  a central line set up was at bed side in casepressors were needed, but her blood pressure remained stable andthen increased to 120s systolic when she became fully awake.during this time her uop remained satisfactory, averaging30ml/hour.# ekg changes: the patient had ekg changes during her initialbradycardic/hypotensive episode with new rbbb and minimal stdepressions in v2-v3. a repeat ekg 30 minutes later showedresolution of these findings and only showed atrial fibrillationwith no st/t wave abnormalities. the patient does not carry thediagnosis of cad, but is a diabetic and is predisposed tovascular abnormalities.  as a result cardiac enzymes werecycled.  a second set did show a small increase in troponin t to0.02, but no mb component. third set of enzymes was negative.# nsclc with pleural effusion: patient is now status post 2cycles with investigatory drug, now with reaccumulation ofpleural effusion.  the reaccumulation likely representsprogression of tumor. on the day following admission, she wasseen by ip and a pleurx catheter was placed at bedside withdrainage of 1100 cc of fluid. after the procedure, the patientreported feelling "much better." f/u chest x-ray showed no ptx.she was called out to the general medical wards after thisprocedure. she was discharged the following day with no acuteissues.# dm 2: the patient's diabetes was generally diet controlled,here with glucose range 150-250.  she was maintained on a riss.# afib: atenolol was discontinued given her hypotension. pt'sheart rate was stable prior to discharge.# hypothyroidism: a tsh was sent and was elevated at 7.8,however, a free t4 was normal at 1.6. te patient was maintainedon her home dose levothyroxine via peg daily.# code status: the patient expressed wishes to be dnr/dni duringthis admission. this decision was discussed with her daughter atbedside. the patient was provided with a dnr/dni form tocomplete should she require future documentation of thisdecision. patient was discharged home with vna. the family didnot want hospice but vna will be there to assist them and helpmake the patient comfortable. palliative care was also consultedthis admission to help with planning.medications on admission:allkare protective barrier wipes -
