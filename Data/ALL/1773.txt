however , leaflet excursion is good ,the peak transaortic velocity is 2 mm per second consistent with apeak instantaneous gradient of 60 mmhg. the mitral annulus isthickened and calcified. there is mild to moderate mitralregurgitation. the peak antegrade mitral velocity is 1.8 ,consistent with a maximal gradient of approximately 12. the valvearea is estimated at approximately 1.8 cm2. mild tricuspidregurgitation was noted , with a regurgitant velocity of 2.5 ,consistent with normal pulmonary systolic pressures. due to hernonhealing ulcer for which she has been evaluated by derm for overa year , patient was seen by vascular surgery to evaluate forvascular compromise as a component of these nonhealing ulcers.abis were obtained , which showed both left and right abis greaterthan 1 , also pvrs were normal throughout and it was felt that therewas no vascular component to these nonhealing ulcers , and theyrecommended that it was due to venous stasis changes and chronicedema and felt local wound care and leg elevation would be thetreatment of choice at this point. patient , with some evidence ofpoor dentition , was seen by the dental team , which felt that therewas no evidence of active infection at this time that neededfurther dental treatment prior to her surgery. due to her plan forvalve replacement , patient was empirically started on vancomycin ,levofloxacin , and flagyl for coverage of these nonhealing ulcers.patient was also seen by dermatology , who felt these were venousstasis ulcers and recommended hibiclens wash , as well as silvadenedressing with xeroform gauze , and leg elevation , and alsorecommended lower noninvasive to rule out dvt , which was obtainedon 4/25/03 which showed no evidence of dvt. on 8/11 patient wastaken down to the operating room and underwent a mitral valvereplacement , with preservation of the posterior mitral leaflet , andhad a hancock porcine valve placed. total cardiopulmonary bypasstime was 126 minutes. cross-clamp time was 89 minutes. patientcame off the heart-lung machine on levophed and was paced with aninternal pacer and was started on some iv amiodarone foruncontrolled a fib immediately coming off the heart-lung machine.over the next few hours , patient had frequent ectopy over the pacerand the cardiology team was consulted. with interrogation of thepacer , they felt that she was having frequent infranodal ectopy ,but the pacer itself with the av function was functioning normally.the af suppression was temporarily turned off , which they felt maystabilize the rate and decrease the amount of ectopy that was seenon the monitor. over the next several days , patient with theamiodarone drip had better rate control , with suppression of alsothe intrinsic a fib that she had preoperatively , and on post-op day#3 was switched over to lopressor from amiodarone , perrecommendation of cardiology. patient was extubated on post-op day#1 and required heavy diuresis over the next several days to weanoff her o2 , but by day of discharge was weaned off o2. chest x-raylooked slightly wet , so patient will continue on diuresis at therehab center. the patient with improvement of her venous stasisulcers; however , they are still open , and with discussion with thecardiac surgery chief fellow it was discussed that until they werehealed with new valves in place that they would like to continuethe triple antibiotics of vancomycin , levofloxacin , and flagyl , andwill be discharged to the rehab with those antibiotics. thelevofloxacin and flagyl can be as p.o. and vancomycin as iv. thepatient also had a picc line placed for poor venous access , whichby x-ray was in good position and 43 cm in length.the patient by post-op day #10 was in stable condition to betransferred to the rehab facility , and will be discharged with thefollowing medications: colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.constipation , lasix 40 mg p.o. t.i.d. x 5 days and to reassessfurther lasix dosing , ibuprofen 200-800 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.pain , levoxyl 50 mcg p.o. q.d. , lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , flagyl500 mg p.o. t.i.d. until improvement of leg ulcer , niferex 150 mgp.o. b.i.d. , darvocet 100 one tablet q.6h. p.r.n. pain , silvadene1% topical b.i.d. to the venous stasis ulcer , vancomycin 1 g q.12h.( hold for vancomycin trough >15 ) , coumadin , to check with hold q.d.to target inr between 2 to 3 , coumadin will be 5 mg dose tonight ,k-dur 20 meq p.o. t.i.d. x 5 days while on the current lasixdosing , levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. once a day , and carraklenz oneapplication topical b.i.d. as needed for dressing changes.patient to follow up with her cardiologist , dr. lausier , phonenumber 099-573-0195 , in 1-2 weeks;
