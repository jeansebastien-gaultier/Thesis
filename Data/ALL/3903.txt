transported to [hospital1 336]/[hospital1 ] for evaluation of vomiting xfew days (2 or 4 days, depending on whose report you read). hewas only responsive to verbal stimuli per ems notes. and perevaluation from the ambulance, his bp was 70/30, rr 30s and hr60s. of note, patient has been having poor appetite x 4 days.kub was apparently negative for obstruction..from his rn home, he was noted to have:- cr of 2.9 bun of 65 on [2107-9-24] and digoxin level of 1.5- inr of 1.07 on [2107-9-24] and pt of 11.6.in the ed:he was alert and following commands. initially bp responded tofluids and was in the 110s, then dropped to 67/59 - started ondopamine.he was also initially bradycardic to the 40s-50s (but then 110sfor unclear reasons). dopamine was titrated to 10mcg/kg/min andthen was placed on levophed at 0.5mcg/kg/min and then titratedup to 3mcg/kg/min. on arrival to the floor, he was on onlylevophed at 3mcg/kg/min.- increased pulmonary congestion and bipap was applied.- received 7l ns in ed- got levo/flagyl/vanco.access: a l groin was attempted. then a r ij was attempted -which led to guidewire getting stuck in the ivc filter. this wasremoved by vascular surgery. finally, a r

rightinfrahilarregion..[2107-9-30] picc line placement..[2107-9-30] nasogastric tube placement.brief hospital course:patient is an 80 year old male with history of cad, chf,dementia, schizophrenia, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiacdysrythmia who was admitted for sepsis..1. septic shock/infectious disease issues: patient presentedfrom his nursing home with hypotension, leukocytosis, acute onchronic renal failure, indicating sepsis.  initial studiesdemonstrated cxr with right lower lobe pneumonia, and u/a thatwas positive.  patient also with some cellulitis in left lowerextremity.  therefore, intially thought source of sepsis waspneumonia vs uti vs cellulitis.  cortisol stimulation test wasnegative, ruling out adrenal insufficiency on admission.  thepatient was fluid rescusitated and initially started on levaphedfor pressor support.  he was maintained on vancomycin and zosynfor broad spectrum antibiotics coverage.shortly after admission, patient had improved blood pressure andlevaphed pressor was weaned off.  blood cultures from admissiongrew coag negative staph, 2/2 bottles, likely source of thisinfection being his left lower extremity cellulitis.  thereforehe was maintained on vancomycin to complete a 14 day course.wound care nursing was also consulted and dressing changes wereapplied per their recommendations.for his pneumonia, sputum culture did not grow any bacteria.urine legionella antigen was negative.  therefore patient wasempirically treated with vancomycin to complete a 14 day course,as above, and zosyn, which was converted to levofloxacin ondischarge, for gram negative coverage to complete a 7 daycourse.for his presumed uti, the patient had 2 positive u/a's duringthe hospital course, with negative urine cultures.  the 3rd u/aprior to discharge was negative, with a corresponding negativeculture.therefore, upon discharge, patient had a very stable bloodpressure, stable oxygenation off of oxygen, and was dischargedon vancomycin to complete a 14 day course and levofloxacin tocomplete a 7 day course (started with zosyn).  he had a piccline placed prior to discharge..2. cardiac:a. ischemia:  patient has a history of coronary artery disease.on presentation, ekg demonstrated right bundle branch block(last ekg in our system is from [2092] that demonstrates no rbbb -however, obtained outside hospital records that does show rbbb,so not new).  on admission, cardiac enzymes were elevated.cardiology was therefore consulted.  patient was thought to behaving a demand ischemic event, and therefore was started onheparin drip to complete 48 hours per cardiologyrecommendations.  his outpatient aspirin dose was increased from81mg to 325mg daily.  he initially could not be on beta blockertherapy given his hypotensive sepsis.  upon resolution of hishypotension, his outpatient lopressor was re-started andtitrated up to his outpatient dose of 50mg [hospital1 ].  his ck peakedat 372, and cardiac enzymes trended down throughout remainder ofhospital course.  no plans for cardiac catheterization given thenature of his mi in setting of sepsis, and his co-morbidconditions.b. rhythm:  patient had a known history of some cardiacdysrhythmia, but unknown type.  during hospital course, patientwas noted to have strange rhythm on telemetry and ekg.  theelectrophysiologist cardiologists were curbsided, and believedthe patient's rhythm to be due to wenkebach rhythm.  theyrecommended no further intervention and believed that thepatient's outpatient digoxin could be discontinued.  otherwisepatient was maintained on lipitor, as above.c. pump:  patient has a history of chf, and was on lisinopriland lasix and digoxin as and outpatient.  all of thesemedications were held on admission due to the patient's renalfailure and sepsis.  echo on admission demonstrated diffusedisease, ef 20-25%, mod-severe aortic stenosis, mild aorticregurgitation, mild-mod mitral regurgiation.  upon resolution ofthe patient's sepsis/hypotension, his lisinopril was restarted.digoxin and lasix were not restarted.  spironolactone wasinitiated given the patient's heart failure and low ef.  heremained euvolemic during remainder of hospital course..3. acute on chronic renal failure:  patient with a history ofchronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatnine thought tobe 2.0.  on day of admission, cr was elevated at 2.9 and quicklyrose to peak of 5.6.  patient was fluid rescusitated and crdropped throughout admission and was down to 1.1 at time ofdischarge.during hospital course, the patient's lisinopril, lasix, anddigoxin were held due to the patient's renal failure.  only hislisinopril was restarted, as above.  his antibiotics wererenally dosed and adjusted throughout hospital course..4. anemia:  patient had a hematocrit of low 30's on admission,trended down to low of 26 during hospital course.  iron studieswere consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  patient wastransfused 1 unit of prbc for hct of 26, given his history ofcad, and hct bumped appropriately to 29, and remained stableduring remainder of .  ? baseline.  hct increased to 29 w/ 1unit prbc.  plan to:- will f/u iron studies- guaiac all stools- tfs to keep hct > 28- moniter.5. facial eccymoses and erythema: patient had noted left sidedperi-orbital facial erythema and eccymoses on exam on [9-27].radiology and opthalmology were contact[name (ni) ] as this was thoughtpossibley secondary to peri-orbital cellulitis.  mri scan wasinitially considered for futher evaluation.  however,opthalmology evaluated the patient and thought it was unlikelyto be peri-orbital cellulitis, and therefore no imaging wasnecessary.  this exam finding was thought likely secondary tothe heparin drip that the patient was on for his cardiac issues,and continued to improve throughout remainder of hospital courseonce heparin was discontinued..6. guidewire caught on ivc filter:  patient had a right ijguidewire get caught in his ivc filter during his ed course.this was removed by vascular surgery.  patient was given 1u prbcin ed for fear of bleed.  hematocrit remained stable.  nothingfurther was done..7. mental status:  patient was somnolent on admission, likelysecondary to his infectious status.  he returned quickly to hisbaseline mental status that included being awake, alert,pleasant, responsive, oriented only x 1 to person.  he waswritten for zyprexa 5mg prn for agitation, but did not receiveany during hospital course..8. peripheral vascular disease:  patient had dopplerable pulseson this admission..9. coagulopathy: patient on coumadin as outpatient fordysrhythmias and lower extremity dvt.  coumadin was initiallyheld given the patient's poor clinical condition.  it wasrestarted during hospital course, and he was discharged on hisoutpatient dose of 1mg qhs, with a subtherapeutic inr.  itshould be addressed with his outpatient primary care physicianwhether or not to continue his coumadin, given his fall risk andhis risk vs benefit ratio..10.  hypernatremia:  patient was quite hypernatremic duringhospital course, with sodium of 151 on admission.  this wasthought likely a hypovolemic hypernatremia.  his hypernatremiaimproved slightly with initial fluid rescusitation.  the patientthen proceded to get free water boluses per his ng tube, whichcontinued to control his hypernatremia..11.  nutrition:  patient underwent speech and swallow evaluationearly in hospital course which he failed.  therefore he had anng tube placed and received tube feeds and medications per hisng tube.  upon improved alertness, patient underwent a repeatbedside speech and swallow evaluation, which he also failed.following this, patient lost his ng tube.  he therefore had anir placed post-pyloric feeding tube to continue his tube feedsand medications.  he was discharged with this tube in place withplans for a repeat speech and swallow upon improvement at rehab. if he fails this, the issue of peg tube placement should bebrought up with his [name (ni) 5993], his sister [name (ni) ] [name (ni) 976]..12.  prophylaxis:  patient was initially maintained on heparindrip for his non st elevation mi for dvt prophylaxis, which waschanged to subcutaneous heparin after 48 hours.  he was alsore-started on his coumadin as above.  he was also maintained ona ppi..13. access:  picc line was placed prior to
