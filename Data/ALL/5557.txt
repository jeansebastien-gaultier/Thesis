[known lastname 90050] is a 69f with a history of recently diagnosedsynchronous stage iiib non-small cell lung cancer(adenocarcinoma by bronchial brushings) and renal cellcarcinoma, currently s/p left nephrectomy and undergoingchemotherapy and radiation. she underwent ct scan of her chestfor re-staging of her lung cancer on [2159-8-6], which demonstratedan increasingly large pericardial effusion (had been previouslynoted on pet scan in [month (only) 116]). she has recently been experiencingworsening shortness of breath at home, which she notices onlywith exertion such as carrying a full basket of laundry. she hashad some associated cough, but no sputum production. inaddition, about 3 weeks ago she was seen at [hospital3 1443]hospital for chest pain; she was ruled out for mi and plannedfor outpatient echocardiogram, which would have been today butshe cancelled given her oncology appointments. she has not had arecurrence of the chest pain. she was seen today in clinic todayby her oncologist dr. [last name (stitle) ], who noted her complaints ofworsening dyspnea on exertion and referred her to the ed forechocardiogram to evaluate for possible tamponade. in the ed,echocardiogram showed brief right atrial collapse and impairedfilling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponadephysiology.  she was evaluated by interventional cardiology andtaken to the catheterization lab for pericardial fluid removal..she underwent pericardial drain placement with ~400 cc of bloodyfluid removed, followed by rapid drainage of another ~150cc intothe drainage bag. she tolerated the procedure well. immediatepost-procedure echo showed small residual pericardial effusionwith no fluid was sent for cytology. her oncologist dr. [last name (stitle) ]was contact[name (ni) ] and updated with the events of the procedure. herequested transfusion of 2 units prbcs for anemia..on the floor, she reports feeling well. no current sob at restor chest pain (only very mild site tenderness with drainplacement)..of note, her cancer history is well-documented in omr note bydr. [last name (stitle) ] dated [2159-8-9]. briefly, she initially presented in[month (only) 404] with hematuria, and further work up revealed both alarge 9-cm renal mass and a rul 9-cm mass with mediastinalnodes. based on renal biopsy (rcc, clear cell type) andbronchial brushings (likely adenocarcinoma) these are twoseparate cancers.  she has been treated with chemotherapy withcysplatin and paclitaxel (start date [2159-7-12]) and radiationtherapy to the chest, in addition to unilateral nephrectomy in4/[2159]..on review of systems, she endorses bilateral chronic hip painwith walking (not new or changed), and dark stool secondary toiron use. she denies any prior history of stroke, tia, deepvenous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time ofsurgery (though had one gi bleed on aspirin in [2154]), myalgias,hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. she denies recentfevers, chills, nightsweats or rigors. no recent cold or flusymptoms. she denies exertional buttock or calf pain. she deniesdysuria or other urinary symptoms. cardiac review of systems isnotable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,orthopnea (sleeps with one flat pillow), ankle edema,palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  all of the other review ofsystems were negative.past medical history:- renal cell carcinoma (clear cell type by biopsy) s/punilateral left nephrectomy

diagnosed early [2159],undergoing chemotherapy and radiation, who presents with doe andworsening pericardial effusion with evidence of early tamponadeby echocardiogram. admitted to ccu for monitoring s/ppericardial drain placement.active issues:.# pericardial effusion: pericardiocentesis was performed withimmediate drainage of 400cc sanguinous fluid. overnight, another~450cc sanguinous fluid drained, and samples were sent for gramstain, protein content, culture, electroyltes and cytology.post-procedure echo showed a small loculated residual effusionwith no evidence of tamponade physiology. cytology was negativefor malignacy, but suspicion remains high for a malignantetiology. pulsus was followed throughout her hospital course,and at the time of post-procedure echo pulses was 12 by doppler.pt was asymptomatic at the time of discahrge and specificallydenied cp/sob/doe, palpitations or lightheadedness. ifpericardial effusion reaccumulates, would consider ct surgeryconsult for pericardial window..# renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer: notreatments were undertaken during this hosptial course. pt wasdiscahrged with heme/onc follow-up with dr. [last name (stitle) ]..# tachycardia - pt remained tachycardic to the 100-120sthroughout her course. initially it was felt this may have been[2-28] tamponade physiology, but tachycardia persisted s/ppericardiocentesis. she was then transfused 2u prbcs at therequest of dr. [last name (stitle) ] and bolused 1l ns due to concern foranemia/hypovolemia, but tachycardia persisted. review of clinicvisits revealed that she has been persistently  tachycardic forseveral months, which may be related to the small loculatedeffusion that was not accessed by the tap. the patient deniedpain throughout her course and refused any pain medicaitons.orthostatics were checked at discahrge and were normal..# anemia: her hct has trended down over the past 6 months. thisis likely related to chonric disease, and pt was transfused 2uprbcs during this admission. she is taking fe supplementation,which was continued during her hospitalization..# leukocytosis: she had a low grade leukocytosis throughout heradmission, which is consistent with her baseline. suspect thisis related to her malignancies. she remained afebrile andnormotensive throughout her course, pericardial and urinecultures were negative and cxr showed no evidence of pulmonaryprocess..chronic issues:.# hypertension: generally normotensive. continued home meds(amlodipine 10 mg po daily, hctz 25 mg po daily) with holdingparameters..# hyperlipidemia: continued rosuvastatin 10 mg po qhs..# depression/anxiety: denies current depression. states shetakes xanax once daily in the mornings. continued effexor xr 150mg po daily. continued xanax 0.5 mg po daily (in am)..# osteoporosis: continued alendronate 70 mg po q week (mondays)..transition of care: pt was discharged home with heme/onc followup. she was also scheduled for an outpatient echo that should befollowed up by her pcp/oncologist. she was instructed to returnto the er if she experiecned worsening sob/cp, as this mayrepreset reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.medications on admission:- alendronate 70 mg po q week on mondays- alprazolam 0.5 mg po prn (takes once daily in am)- amlodipine 10 mg po daily- hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po daily- maalox:benadryl:2%lidocaine mixture 1:1:1 15 minutes beforemeals and at bedtime prn (no recent use)- olmesartan 40 mg po daily- odansetron 8 mg po q8h prn nausea (no recent use)- prochlorperazine 10 mg po q8h prn nausea (no recent use)- rosuvastatin 10 mg po qhs- venlafaxine er-24 hr 150 mg po daily- acetaminophen 325-650 mg po 30 minutes before meals prnodynophagia (no recent use)- ferrous sulfate 325 mg po daily- fish oil dha epa 1,200 mg-144 mg po daily- magnesium oxide 400 mg po dailydischarge medications:1. ferrous sulfate 325 mg (65 mg iron) tablet sig: one (1)tablet po once a day.2. prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet poq8h (every 8 hours) as needed for nausea.3. rosuvastatin 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.4. alendronate 70 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qmon (everymonday).5. acetaminophen 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po q6h (every 6hours) as needed for pain.6. halobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream sig: one (1)  topical qid(4 times a day) as needed for dry skin.7. maalox:benadryl:2%lidocaine mixture   sig: one (1)   15minutes before meals and at bedtime.8. fish oil 1,200-144-216 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule poonce a day.9. magnesium oxide 400 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once aday.10. alprazolam 0.5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a dayas needed for anxiety.11. amlodipine 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.12. hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po oncea day.13. olmesartan 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.14. venlafaxine 150 mg capsule, ext release 24 hr sig: one (1)capsule, ext release 24 hr po once a day.15. ondansetron 8 mg tablet, rapid dissolve sig: one (1) tablet,rapid dissolve po every eight (8) hours as needed for nausea.discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:primary diagnosiscardiac tamponadesecondary diagnosislung cancerrenal canceranemiadischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory -
