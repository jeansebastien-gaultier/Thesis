record date: 2118-04-15	cardiology		park nicollet clinic		reason for visit:   55 y/o columbian male with a history of htn, hyperlipidemia, severe as s/p avr (st. judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for mrsa/visa endocarditis presenting for follow-up. 	interval history:   the patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical avr for symptomatic severe as.  he had preserved lv function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive cad.  he initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  at that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ercp pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  he was admitted to pnc in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-y cyst-jejunostomy.  he underwent the gi surgery on 1/11/18.  his post-operative course was complicated by recurrent gib upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical avr that prolonged his hospital stay. unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  he developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for mrsa that had intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin.  he was initially treated with vancomycin and gentamicin with addition of rifampin later in the course of treatment.  he developed progressive pr prolongation on ecg and  a tte on 2/10/18 and tee on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  a follow-up tee on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the or by dr. elrod on 2/17/18.  the intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe rv failure.  on pod 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (vt/vf) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  a tee done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe tr, and preserved lv function.  emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of rca vasospasm.  an iabp was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  he was taken to the or for closure on 2/22/18.his course was subsequently notable for arf which transiently required cvvh, development of hit, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. abi testing revealed no evidence of pad.  he was followed by id and was placed on daptomycin and bactrim. he was seen by vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  with supportive care, he was successfully weaned off iabp and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  his course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to bactrim induced rta. he also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. he was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.since discharge, he reports doing relatively well. he reports fatigue and doe after walking up a flight of stairs.  he is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  he denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, pnd, orthopnea, le edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. he also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. he has been seen in follow up by dr. infant-nickel in id earlier this month.  he was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated esr and crp.  the plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of bactrim.  he has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.	past medical history:   1. mrsa/visa prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. originally underwent avr for severe as on 03/13/2117. developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. intraoperatively developed severe rv failure.2. rv failure. complication of aortic homograft surgery. tee on 2/20/18 showed severe rv hypokinesis and severe tr.3. hit. developed hit post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.4. coronary artery disease. preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main;
