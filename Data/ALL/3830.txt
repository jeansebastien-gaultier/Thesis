gram negative rod bacteremia.problems: 1. aplastic anemia. 2. hemochromatosis.chief complaint/identification: the patient is a 34 year-old womanwith a 22 year history of aplasticanemia , transfusion dependent for 13 years , complicated byhemochromatosis , now with gram negative rod bacteremia.history of the present illness: the patient is a 34 year-old womandiagnosed with aplastic anemia 22years ago. the patient never had a potential donor for transplantand was immediately treated with immunosuppressive therapy foraplastic anemia using steroids without efficacy. the patientsuffered complications from steroid use , including avascularnecrosis , resulting in bilateral hip replacements as well aschronic bony damage to her shoulders for which she uses painmedications. for the past 13 year , the patient has remainedtransfusion dependent and requires a few units on packed red bloodcells on an every two week basis and platelet transfusions whenevershe develops epistaxis. in september of 1998 , the patient developeddiabetes mellitus. the patient had already been known to have anelevated ferratin due to blood transfusions from years previously.however , when she had been started on desferal in the past , shedeveloped a port-a-cath infection and ultimately leakage ofdesferal to the surrounding skin , which resulted in extrusion ofher port-a-cath through her skin. she was therefore off desferalfor a number of years. the patient presented in mid september of 1998with a blood glucose in the 500 to 600 range , associated withpolyuria , polydipsia , and a 19 pound weight loss. an abdominal ctscan was performed at that time , which was consistent with ironoverload. the patient's ferratin was noted to be the 7 , 000 range.the patient was begun on insulin therapy and desferal 24 hours aday. a port-a-cath was placed in the patient's left upper chest.the patient's desferal was given at 2 grams per 24 hours. she hada gradual decrease in her insulin requirements by 50%. in april of1998 , the patient went on vacation to wark for two weeks.toward the end of her stay , she developed an infected port-a-cathand was readmitted to the jera counta in earlyapril with a port-a-cath infection. at that time , four out of fourblood cultures grew out staphylococcus aureus. because of concernof the long term sequelae of staphylococcus aureus infection , thepatient was treated with nafcillin for six weeks. the patient didwell on nafcillin with resolution of her fevers. the patient wasreadmitted to the biehay sciencesmot hospital on october , 1998 tojuly , 1998 for a two day history of fevers to 101 associatedwith the development of a painful perirectal abscess. the abscesswas assessed and required surgical drainage after a platelettransfusion to increase the patient's platelets to 42 , 000. thepatient underwent an incision through the imount sheo bona medical center .  byjuly , 1998 , the cultures from her abscess grew gram negativeenteric rods , sensitive to cipro. all of the patient's bloodcultures were negative. speciation of the gram negative rodsrevealed klebsiella pneumonia. the patient was discharged home onciprofloxacin , which she took for an additional ten days afterdischarge. since september , 1998 , the patient had been off allantibiotics and the plan was for licausi to have another set of bloodcultures drawn to document resolution of all infection prior to theconsideration of putting in a new central access , such as ahickman. the patient was seen at the h care healthon the day prior to admission and reported that she had beenentirely afebrile without chills. the patient also noted that herblood sugar was well controlled on a stable regimen of insulin inthe 24 hours after she was seen in the clinic. two out of fourblood cultures that were drawn in the clinic revealed gram negativerods. the patient was therefore asked to return to the do county hospital for treatment of gram negative rod bacteremia.past
