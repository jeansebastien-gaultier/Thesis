:sodium 135 , potassium 4.1 , chloride 101 , c02 28.4 , bun 17 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 302 , calcium 8.6 , phosphorus 2.5 , magnesium 1.6 , total protein 6.7 , albumin 3.3 , globulin 3.4 , uric acid 6.3 , totalbilirubin .7 , alkaline phosphatase 93 , sgot 20 , ldh 258 , cpk 95 , whiteblood count 15.3 , hematocrit 49.7 , platelet count 159 , mcv 98 .radiologic studies :chest x-ray 10/10/97 :elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .the patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .a lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a ct scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .this ct scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .the fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .the glenoid fossa was intact .no scapular fractures were present .ekg :normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , q - waves seen in ii , iii , and avf with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .t - waves were also noted to be inverted in i and avl .ventricular bigeminy was also seen .hospital course and treatment :1. orthopedics :the patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .he is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .he received ancef preoperatively .physical therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .brittle bones were noted during the operation .a bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .2. neurological :the patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .3. cardiovascular :no chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .the patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .an adenosine sestamibi was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .a small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .an echocardiogram was performed on columbus day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .after his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated cpks were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , cpk # 2 635 , and cpk # 3 461 .mb fractionations of the cpks were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient 's beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .4. gastroenterology :gi was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .upper endoscopy x 2 were done .the first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .the stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .it was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible mallory-weiss tear .a second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .a gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .this report needs to be followed up , and will be available at bri health in the pathology department some time within the next three to seven days .the patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a gi follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .i have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , dr. fordwoodall stick , in ranegei pkwy , verertliet , south carolina 62156 .the patient is to arrange follow up with a gi doctor in jotar boulevard , cunahtampfordama , south dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .the patient was initially on cimetidine and carafate here at bri health , and then switched to prilosec 20 mg bid .5. pulmonary :the patient 's admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .incentive spirometry was started .albuterol and atrovent nebulizers were done .the patient received chest physical therapy bid .6. endocrine :the patient needs still better diabetes control .he has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating pringle 's in the room ) .his nph was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with czi sliding-scale coverage .7. infectious disease :the patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , ph 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .however , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .a repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .8. renal :after the patient 's procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .he was given lasix 40 mg iv x 1 and also had nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .the patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.his bun/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today 's labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .9. hematology :the patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .the patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .the patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .the patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .fen :repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .the patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .condition on discharge :stable , good .medications on discharge :nph insulin 24 units subq. q. a.m. nph insulin 14 units subq. q. p.m. czi sliding scale on a q. a.c. and q. h.s. fingerstick basis with the following scale :fbs less than 200 = 0 units of
