syndrome .2) pneumocystis carinii pneumonia .3) adult respiratory distress syndrome .history of present illness :mr. breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .mr. breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .he was admitted to the retelk county medical center at that time and was treated with bactrim and steroids .he was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .he initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of bactrim and a steroid taper .at discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an o2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .he was seen by dr. seen and dr. seen as an out-patient .on 02/06/91 , he was seen in flfdmc and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .he was evaluated in the emergency room .at that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest x-ray showed no change .cultures were taken and he was sent out .on 02/08/91 , the patient called dr. seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .he was seen in flfdmc where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .his oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .past medical history :1) hiv positive with a cd4 count of 74 .2) recent pcp .3) status post right elbow surgery .4) venereal disease history .5) ppd anergic .the patient &apos;s hiv risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .physical examination :on presentation , the patient was a young appearing hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .skin :jaundiced .heent :revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .neck :he had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .lungs :had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .cardiac :showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .abdomen :soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .his liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .his spleen was not palpable .rectal :he had guaiac positive stools .extremities :unremarkable .genitourinary :his penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .neurological :non-focal .laboratory examination :on admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .pt was 12.6 and ptt was 29 .sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , co2 19 , bun 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .alt was 181 , ast was 156 , ldh was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .( on 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .his arterial blood gas on 50% was po2 92 , pco2 24 , and ph 7.46 .his chest x-ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .hospital course :the patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .in terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a bactrim failure for pcp although this was unusual .he was started on pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to bactrim .the patient was also covered with erythromycin and gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .he was given supplemental oxygen .in terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .titers for cmv and epstein-barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .stool was sent for ova and parasites .gastrointestinal was consulted .initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .however , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of erythromycin and gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his ldh climbed so he began pentamidine on 02/10/91 .on 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his o2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .he was transferred to the intensive care unit on 12/12/90 on gentamicin , vancomycin , pentamidine , and prednisone .also of note at that point , hepatitis c virus serologies had come back positive .however , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .the patient &apos;s abdominal ct scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .the patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .the patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on acyclovir .on 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .no other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .the patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .he required elevated ventilatory pressures with pips often above 60 .fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .however , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse i to e ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .the patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .these were supported with blood products and hematology was consulted .they felt that it was most likely secondary to bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the medical team , to withdraw ventilatory support .this was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.disposition :the patient died in hospital .an autopsy will be performed .an autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .we221/9850 tako c. inske , m.d. , ph.
