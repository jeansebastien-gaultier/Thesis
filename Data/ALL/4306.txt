normocephalic / atraumatic , extraocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation .chest had diffuse crackles bilaterally halfway up .coronary - irregular pvcs , s1 , s2 normal , positive systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating throughout .abdomen was distended , tympanitic , mildly tender epigastrium and right lower quadrant .no rebound or guarding .extremities had 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema to knees .no clubbing or cyanosis .neurologic examination - alert and oriented x 3 , slurred and slow speech , distractable .cranial nerves ii through xii are intact .sensory is intact to soft touch throughout .strength is 5/5 throughout .laboratory data :white blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , mcv 81 .sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , bun 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , ast 49 , alt33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .hospital course :1. gastrointestinal .the patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .the drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by ir , when it was accidentally removed .increased flow again .the patient had signs and symptoms develop of sbp , also with an elevated white count .he was treated broadly with amp , levo and flagyl .cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .the patient 's abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .clinically , this was consistent with sbp , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .he underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .this had to be performed by ir because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .he received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on levofloxacin iv for prophylaxis against sbp .2. pulmonary .from a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .his apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .however , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .on the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .the plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and lasix to mobilize his fluid .3. cardiovascular .he had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .he was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .he did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .4. endocrine .diabetes .his avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .he is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .5. heme .from a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated pt inr .he required a few transfusions during his hospital course .he also required ffp initially to reverse his coagulopathy .however , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .his inr normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on lovenox .6. renal .he had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .from his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .however , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .at the time , nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .his appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .7. id .please see gi .he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical sbp .he will be maintained on levofloxacin for prophylaxis against sbp .given that he will need continued taps,8. oncology .the patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .however , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and i do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .his pain here has been controlled , initially on oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .as he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to iv pain medications only .discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .code status -
