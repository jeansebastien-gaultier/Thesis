issues.1.  pain.  he has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.  has been treating with percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.  he was seen in the pain clinic and was started on neurontin.  it is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.  dr. hoover has been renewing his percocet prescriptions.  he has had a cat scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.2.  esophageal cancer status post resection by dr. patton.  he has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with dr. yan.  the last ct scan was in june 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.  he has not yet had a repeat ct scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the cancer center where he feels more relaxed.3.  coronary artery disease.  he is status post an mi in 2084.  he has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report.  he is followed by dr. mckee at the trimont health care center.4.  status post fem-pop bypass of the left side.  he says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the percocet.  past medical history:  significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control.  his last hemoglobin a1c was 6.5 and that was in 10/94.  status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.medications:  diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d.,

died of an mi and had diabetes mellitus.review of systems:  comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist.  no fevers or chills.  no burning or pain with urination.  the rest of the review of systems was negative.physical examination:  today, his blood pressure is 122/80 and his pulse is 80.  his height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds.  in general, he is in no acute distress.  he is well appearing.  sclerae are anicteric.

are rather dark.  no specifically suspicious lesion.impression and plan:  a 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.1.  diabetes, recheck hemoglobin a1c today.  he is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.2.  pain.  he has had this pain syndrome for quite some time.  he is on short-acting narcotic and i think this is appropriate.  i am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his percocet to 4 per day.  hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his percocet altogether.3.  esophageal cancer.  follow up with dr. yan and dr. patton.4.  pulmonary nodule.  i emphasized the need for him to repeat his ct scan.  i sent an email to dr. yan.  he wants to only do them at the cancer center and that is where last films were done.  i explained how important it was.4.  idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  we are going to watch this.  he had a workup by dr. sawyer in the past.  he reports no bleeding.5.  coronary artery disease.  i asked him to get dr. landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram.  we are going to check his cholesterol today.  he will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.6.  his ekg today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor r-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct.  i do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.______________________________scott koontz, mddictated by: scott koontzescription document:9-6525022 emssten teldd: 12/24/95dt:
