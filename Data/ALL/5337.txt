health problemshpi: patient recently presented to bmh with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac. no seizure activity. he was brought to bmh where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at bmh, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. he ruled out for mi, had tte showing ef 59% but had inf. wma and la dilation. cardiology was therefore consulted. an adenomibi stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a lhcath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the rca and distal plv. the patient also underwent an ep study that was non-diagnostic. an implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21. other work up of syncope included cnis showing mild rica stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.    in hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. endocrine w/u included nl tsh and cortstim. the patient had had a recent chest and abd ct and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. spep and bnp wnl and; his psa was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. the patient's nutrition and po intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen.    just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated ep study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts ("i lost my mortal soul"). psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolongedhospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. it was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.hospitalization done on psych floor. per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. the pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. he stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that god could not forgive him. he stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. he had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.           on the inpt ward, mr. shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qhs. cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qday with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.  the patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to remeron 15mg. at the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.  he further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief "most of the time.neuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. he had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. he had very poor learning of new information.           pt was discharged to
