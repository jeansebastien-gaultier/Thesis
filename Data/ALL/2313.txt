pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic rp fibrosispresenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distensionfound to have dvt and with progressive chylous ascites.1)chylous ascites: the patient was noted to have a distendedabdomen on presentation and imaging revealed a large amount ofascites.  as the patient had not had a previous history ofascites this was worked up with liver ultrasound that revealedno parenchymal or vascular dysfunction.  diagnostic paracentesiswas obtained on [2196-11-5] that showed chylous ascites.  thisparacentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient wasempirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone thoughhe remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.  after thechylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for amalignancy given the lack of liver disease.  multiple imagingstudies failed to show a mass,  however, multiple fluidcytologies were negative, and the patient's ldh was withinnormal limits making lymphoma quite unlikely.  therefore, mostlikely etiology of the development of chylous ascites wasthought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from rp fibrosisleading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into theperitoneal cavity.  the patient had three therapeuticparacentesis on [11-14], and [11-29] respectively removing 900cc, 3l and 1 l of chylous fluid respectively.  the second ofthese revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a secondcourse of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as thepatient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured)which completed on [2196-11-29].  all cultures remained negative.unfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax fromfluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratorydistress.  attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid withmedical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then lowfat tpn but these were unsuccessful.  general surgery wasconsulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt toimprove lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures arevery small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likelybe as damaging as initial insult.  case was discussed withthoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage tothoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management. finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussedextensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation ofcisterna chyli.  unfortunately, planning mri would have beenrequired and given patient's progressively poor respiratorystatus this would have required intubation.  as lymphangiogramand balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds ofsuccess were not considered high and risk of intubation andlikely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family andpatient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  thepossibility of disease modifying therapy for rp fibrosis wasdiscussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be norole for the agents used (almost all of which are immunesuppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these thingswould be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.2) chylothorax/hypoxic respiratory failure: the patient wasinitially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desatsto the low 90's on room air.  he was seen by pulmonary whoattributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causingrestrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonaryasbestosis and plaques.  this was supported by his initial pft'sthat showed a restrictive pattern.  the patient then becameprogressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding rightsided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressiveatelectasis.  he was desatting to the low 90's on 4l o2 by nasalcannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [2196-11-10] withconsiderable improvement after the procedure.  by [11-12], however,he had reaccumulated almost completely and by [11-13] wasdesaturating again so that an abg showed of o2 of around 53.therefore, he was transferred to the unit while he awaited asecond thoracentesis.  as he reaccumulated quickly again afterthat thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtailcatheter, which was placed on [2196-11-15].  over the ensuing daysthe patient continued to put out greater than one liter ofchylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the variousinterventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fatdiets, octreotide, etc...).  on [2196-11-29] a pleurodesis wasattempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chesttube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a verylow probability of being successful.  after the secondthoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4l ofoxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.  on [11-26] hedesaturated to the 80's on 6l in the context of worseninginfiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holdingtpn and was ultimately thought most likely due to volumeoverload. however, on the day of expected discharge ([11-30]), hisrespiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% onnon-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask. given thatcomfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula,and oxygen saturations were no longer followed.3) nutrition/protein loss: initially the patient was allowed toeat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he wasconverted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made npo withtpn. despite tpn his protein and albumin continued to fallpresumably due to losses in the chest tube.   after he becamequite volume overloaded on [2196-11-27] and given the minimalreduction in fluid output seen even with the tpn modificationstpn was stopped as of [11-27] and he was allowed to eat forcomfort.  he and his family understand he will ultimatelycontinue to become malnourished and weaker but given poortoleration of tpn and comfort focused care this was consideredacceptable by them.4) health care associated pneumonia: the patient was noted tohave intermittently elevated white counts and on [2196-11-19] had aright upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulentsputum.  therefore, he received 9 days of cefepime/vancomycinwith some improvement in his sputum production and stable chestradiograph findings.  white count failed to trend reliably. hewas never febrile.5) lle dvt: he was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned tobe therapeutic on coumadin.  he was transferred back to heparingtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughouthis course there to make procedures feasible without needing along warfarin wash-out. anticoagulation with medications otherthan unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was notoptimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.6)cellulitis: the patient initially received a dose ofpenicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvementin his abdominal rash.  he then received 10 days of vancomycinas well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominalrash could be a contact dermatitis.  this led to resolution ofhis abdominal rash.7) likely drug rash: later in his hospitalization (around[11-19]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on histrunk in the context of receiving a dose ofpiperacillin-tazobactam in the icu.  this medication was stoppedan his rash resolved.8) hypotension: the patient developed relative hypotension inthe hospital.  multiple blood cultures were negative and thisseemed stable without mental status changes or end organdysfunction (except some worsening of his ckd).  this wasthought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive thirdspacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compressionof the ivc by his abdomen.9) acute kidney injury: the patient's baseline cr is unclear.at presentation cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 beforetrending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and hisgeneral deterioration.  renal was consulted twice and ultimatelyconcluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flowfrom the heart in the context of his third spacing and massiveabdominal distension.  he never became oliguric or anuric.10) atrial fibrillation: the patient developed atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodalagents were being held.  this broke with diltiazem and he wasrestarted on this medication with good rate control.11) goals of care: after extensive discussion with the familyand patient about the lack of options for reversing thepatient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequentrespiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting theyelected to pursue comfort focused care.  reasonably benigninterventions (i.e. antibiotics, pleurodesis through apreexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive careswere not.  similarly oral feeds were pursued even in the face ofa possible sbo for the patient's comfort and happiness.  hismajor goal was comfort and the family and patient understood hispoor prognosis. when his respiratory status deteriorated on[11-30] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were notpursued, and he was given morphine. he passed away in theevening of [11-30], and his family was notified. autopsy wasrequested and will be performed at [hospital1 18].medications on admission: 1. pantoprazole 40 mg
