[month/year (2) ] on [6-4] showed stable loculatedpericardial effusion. [month/year (2) ] [6-11] (ef>55%) suggestive ofpericardial constriction, although unchanged in size since prioradmission..during admission on [6-14], cardiology team saw the patient andrecommended trial of low dose beta blocker for rate control; apericardial window was not performed because the effusion wasdetermined to be stable and symptoms thought to be related todehydration and tachycardia.  subsequent ct of the torso did notreveal a primary source but did reveal bony lytic lesions in theright ischium and bilateral ilia concerning for metastaticdisease. she also underwent an upper and lower endoscopy withoutevidence of a  primary lesion. considering pericardial andpleural fluid pathology, a subtle gastric or pancreatico/biliarytumor was suspected and the patient was started ongemcitabine/irinotecan.  her last dose of chemotherapy wasyesterday 8/2 per patient. chemotherapy was begun on [2181-6-15]..pt. presented to ed with tachycardia above baseline in 130s to140s.  patient has h/o resting tachycardia 115-120.electrocardiogram in the ed showed sinus tachycardia unchangedfrom prior.  radiography showed reaccumulation of pulmonaryedema and ct of the chest showed no acute changes.  atherapeutic thoracentesis was performed of 2200 ml of darkmaroon right pleural fluid.  in addition, after the procedure,the patient complained of increased shortness of breathincreased from baseline, patient's o2 saturation was in the 90s. the patient was administered lasix (40 mg x1) in the ed withsubsequent improvement of respiratory function.  in ed patientwas administered vancomycin 1 g, ondasetron 2 mg twice, and 4doses of morphine sulfate 4 mg. patient was admitt-ed to icu forpain control and management of tachycardia in setting of pleuraleffusions.past medical history:- tuberculosis treated in [2145] with normal chest x-ray at [hospital1 2025] in[2162].- gyn: g2 p2. tubal ligation [2156]. stopped menstruating at age50, normal pap's per patient- hypertension.- history of mild asthma, inhalers not used for several years.- normal mammogram less than one year ago.- normal colonoscopy 2/[2178].- recent pericardial effusion/tamponade- right pleural effusion- large common femoral dvt- adenocarcinoma of unclear primarysocial history:she works as a nursing assistant. lives with her husband, whokeeps very early hours, working at the [location (un) ] food market.children are 18 and 19.family history:her father died of stomach cancer at age 72. mother died ofcolon cancer at age 63. she is the 10th of 13 children. she haslost 3 siblings to motor vehicle accidents.physical exam:gen: nadheent: sclera anicteric. perrl, eomi. no oral lesionsneck: supplecv: tachycardic, regular, no m/r/g.chest: bilaterally decreased ll bs l>r to [12-13] way up. r sidedronchi.abd: soft, nnd. no hsm or tenderness.  soft subcutaneous firmmobile nodule in midepigastrium (at site of lovenox injectionsites per patient).ext: no cyanosis or edemaneuro: non-focal, cn ii-xii grossly intact, moves allextremities wellskin: no rash or petechiae notedpertinent results:[2181-7-11] 11:40am   gran ct-1260[2181-7-11] 11:40am   plt count-521[2181-7-11] 11:40am   wbc-2.7 rbc-4.04 hgb-13.2 hct-37.9 mcv-94mch-32.5 mchc-34.7 rdw-17.4[2181-7-12] 12:17pm   lactate-1.7[2181-7-12] 12:22pm   hypochrom-normal anisocyt-1+ poikilocy-normalmacrocyt-1+ microcyt-normal polychrom-occasional[2181-7-12] 12:22pm   alt(sgpt)-98 ast(sgot)-52 ck(cpk)-63 alkphos-148 amylase-30 tot bili-0.8[2181-7-12] 12:22pm   lipase-74[2181-7-12] 12:22pm   glucose-119 urea n-5 creat-0.6 sodium-137potassium-4.5 chloride-102 total co2-24 anion gap-16.c.dif -
