echocardiogramconclusionsthe left atrium is markedly dilated. left ventricular wallthicknesses are normal. the left ventricular cavity is severelydilated. overall left ventricular systolic function is severelydepressed (lvef= 20 %) secondary to muliple areas of severehypokinesis and akinesis (see figure), with posterobasaldyskinesis. tissue doppler imaging suggests an increased leftventricular filling pressure (pcwp>18mmhg). transmitral dopplerand tissue velocity imaging are consistent with grade iii/iv(severe) lv diastolic dysfunction. right ventricular chambersize is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. theaortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. the aorticvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis isnot present. no aortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valveleaflets are mildly thickened. there is no mitral valveprolapse. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [due toacoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may besignificantly underestimated.] the left ventricular inflowpattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, withelevated left atrial pressure. the tricuspid valve leaflets aremildly thickened. moderate to severe [3+] tricuspidregurgitation is seen. there is moderate pulmonary arterysystolic hypertension. there is no pericardial effusion.compared with the findings of the prior report (imagesunavailable for review) of [2155-3-17], the tricuspidregurgitation is probably increased. left ventricularcontractile function remains profoundly depressed..[2158-12-16] -

the patient had a chronic left le ulcerationrelated to a hospitalization several years ago.  it lookederythematous and had purulent drainage on admission.  podiatrywas consulted for deep tracking foot ulcer on left plantarsurface. podiatry ecommended broad spectrum antibiotics.  a footxray was consistent with osteomyelitis.  non-invasive arterialstudies were obtained to evaluate the blood flow to his le priorto an debridement.  the patient had poor arterial blood flow inhis left le and [month/day/year 1106] surgery was consulted and theyrecommendedangiography and possible revascularization procedure in the nextweek.  he was discharged on linezolid and ciprofloxacin.  he hasclose follow up arranged with his pcp, [name10 (nameis) 1106] surgery andpodiatry..# chf, systolic.  his last ef 25%. he appeared clinicallyeuvolemic.  his digoxin and sotalol were continued.  hisdiuretics (lasix and spironolactone) were restarted at lowerdoses given the patient's renal function. echocardiogram waspreformed during this admission..# renal function - the patient's creatinine began to rise duringthis admission most which was felt to be secondary to vancomycintoxicity.  the patients diuretics were held.  he was notpre-renal by labs or volume-depleted on exam.  there was notevidence of ain, atn or renal obstruction.  his creatinineimproved after the vancomycin was discontinued..# the patient's stable medical issues include: hypothyroidism,hyperlipidemi, anxiety, insomnia,.# code: fullmedications on admission:spironolactone 25mg po bidsotalol 120mg po bidbupropion 100mg [hospital1 ]levothyroxine 25mcg dailyclonazepam 0.5mg [hospital1 ]simvastatin 40mg dailydigoxin 125 qam, 250 qpmmidodrine 5mg tidzolpidem 10mg qhsfurosemide 80mg dailylorazepam 3-4mg qhsdischarge medications:1. digoxin 250 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:22. levothyroxine 25 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).3. sotalol 80 mg tablet sig: 1.5 tablets po bid (2 times a day).4. simvastatin 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).5. midodrine 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po tid (3 times aday).6. zolpidem 5 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po hs (at bedtime).7. lorazepam 1 mg tablet sig: four (4) tablet po hs (at bedtime)as needed for insomnia.8. bupropion 100 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po bid (2 times aday).9. furosemide 40 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:210. spironolactone 25 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po daily(daily).disp:15 tablet(s) refills:211. linezolid 600 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a dayfor 14 days.disp:28 tablet(s) refills:012. cipro 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po twice a day for14 days.disp:28 tablet(s) refills:013. outpatient lab workplease check a cbc, bmp (lytes, bun/cr, glucose) and digoxinlevel checked on monday [2158-12-25].  please have the lab resultssent to both dr.
