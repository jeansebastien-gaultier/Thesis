arteries , bothwith 0% occlusion. cardiac catheterization performed at iland frenchcal clami general hospital on 4/18/06 showed stenosis in the followingcoronary arteries: 70% proximal pda , 90% proximal lad , 70% midcircumflex with right dominant circulation. ventriculogramshowed an ejection fraction of 35%. ekg on 10/30/06 showednormal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63. there was poorr-wave progression in the precordial leads and inverted t wavesin leads iii , v5 and v6. chest x-ray on 10/30/06 was consistentwith congestive heart failure and an enlarged cardiac silhouette.there is mild chf , bilateral atelectasis.hospital course: the patient was admitted on the day prior toher scheduled surgery for completion of her preoperative workup.on 7/1/06 , she was brought to the operating room where dr.gonzale performed a cabg x3 using the lima to bypass the lad andsaphenous vein graft to bypass the om1 and saphenous vein graftto bypass the pda. the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 107minutes and the aortic cross-clamp time was 83 minutes. the veinwas harvested from both legs. the patient was transferred to thecardiac surgery intensive care unit after her surgery where she remainedintubated for two days due to poor lungcompliance. she was also hypotensive in the postoperative periodand treated with vasoactive medications. by postoperative day#2 , the patient was extubated and hemodynamically stable ,however , she experienced atrial fibrillation overnight and herlopressor was increased. by post-operative day #3 , her atrial fibrillationwas rate controlled and she was started on coumadin. bypostoperative day #4 , she was ready for transfer from the icu tothe step-down unit. at that point , she was neurologically intactand her pain was well controlled. she was being treated withbeta-blockers and coumadin for afib. from a respiratoryperspective , the patient was being treated with aggressivepulmonary toilet and chest pt. her chest x-ray showed a smallright pleural effusion and she was oxygenating well withsupplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. the patient's diet wasadvanced as tolerated and she exhibited adequate urine output.the patient was treated with lasix for postoperative fluidretention. she also was seen by the diabetes management servicethroughout her postoperative stay for optimal glycemic control.on the step-down unit on postoperative day #5 , the patientexperienced a bradycardic incident with a heart rate of 38 andshe became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/50 after herdiltiazem was increased. she was transferred back to theintensive care unit where she was observed for three more days.during that time , the patient's hemodynamics stabilized althoughshe remained in rate controlled atrial fibrillation. onpostoperative day #8 , she was ready again to transfer back to thestep-down unit where she spent the remaining six days of herhospital stay. the patient's chest x-ray suggested that she wasvolume overloaded and the patient was aggressively treated withlasix and zaroxolyn as her creatinine began to increase slowlyfrom 1.3 to 1.5 to 1.7. the diuretics were decreased. a chestultrasound to evaluate pleural effusion for thoracentesisrevealed that the patient had considerable atelectasis andminimal effusion. the focus then became on chest pt , pulmonarytoilet and deep breathing and coughing. the patient continued toambulate with physical therapy and by postoperative day #13 , thepatient's chest x-ray showed improvement of the atelectasis inthe right lung and the patient had decreased oxygen requirements.from a cardiac perspective in the step-down unit , the patientwas in atrial fibrillation from postoperative days #9 through #11and then converted to a sinus rhythm where she remained for thefinal three days of her hospital stay. the patient had beenstarted on coumadin for her postoperative atrial fibrillation andthis medication should continue at least until she follow up witha cardiologist in an outpatient setting to reevaluated her heartrhythm. by postoperative day #14 , the patient was in a sinusrhythm with a stable blood pressure. she was oxygenating well onroom air and was ambulating effectively on her own. she had nocomplaints and was ready for discharge to home. on that day , hertemperature was 96.4 degrees , heart rate 76 and sinus rhythm ,blood pressure 110/60 , respiratory rate 18 , o2 saturation 94% onroom air. the patient was seven kilograms below her preoperativeweight.discharge condition: stable.disposition: discharged to home with vna services.discharge diet: a low-cholesterol , low-saturated fat 2100calorie per day , 4 gm sodium per day diet.activity: the patient should be walking as tolerated and elevateher feet
