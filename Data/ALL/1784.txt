wereobtained. please note per history, the patient has history oflung cancer. comparison is also made to scout radiograph from ctfrom [2160-11-12].  large area of opacity projecting over the left lung isworrisome forinfectious process, alternatively progression ofmalignancy/lymphangiticspread. opacity is seen to a lesser extent in the right lung.there may besuperimposed pulmonary edema. no large pleural effusion orpneumothorax isseen. again seen, the upper two sternal wires are fractured.cardiac andmediastinal silhouettes are stable.cxr [2160-12-8]- as compared to the previous radiograph, there is aminimal increase in extent of the pre-existing parenchymalopacities. this increase is most noticeable in the right upperlobe. no other relevant changes. status post sternotomy, cabg,moderate cardiomegaly, the presence of a small left pleuraleffusion cannot be excluded.transthoracic echocardiogram [2160-12-9]- poor image quality.theleft atrium is moderately dilated. a small secundum atrialseptal defect is present. the estimated right atrial pressure is0-5 mmhg. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.the left ventricular cavity size is normal. there is moderateregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior andinfero-lateral akinesis and distal septal, distal anterior andapical hypokinesis. there is no ventricular septal defect. rightventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. thediameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels arenormal. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened butaortic stenosis is not present. no aortic regurgitation is seen.the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. moderate tosevere (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valveleaflets are mildly thickened. moderate [2+] tricuspidregurgitation is seen. the pulmonary artery systolic pressurecould not be determined. there is no pericardial effusion.  compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [2160-8-28],the degree of mr [first name (titles) ] [last name (titles) ] seen has increased slightly (degree ofmr [first name (titles) 12314] [last name (titles) 102625] on prior

contrast.2. remote right middle cerebral artery infarction.brief hospital course:77 m with history of stage iiia nsclc, schf with ef 35-40%, cads/p cabg presenting initially for n/v/[hospital ] transferred to icufor hypotension, hypoxia, and fever.# respiratory distress: patient transferred to icu on hd 1 dueto episode of hypotension and hypoxia while receiving bloodtransfusion.  patient continued to be hypotensive and hypoxicthroughout the day with an increasing o2 requirement.  he spikeda fever and cxr was concerning for new pneumonia, so vancomycin,cefepime and levofloxacin were started.  patient was transferredto the icu for close monitoring.  his blood pressure remainedstable with normal mentation and good urine output, and he didnot require any fluid boluses or pressors.  he continued torequire a non rebreather to maintain oxygen saturations, andde-sat'ed to 70s without the facemask.   concerns were for bacterial pneumonia vs pcp pneumonia vsradiation pneumonitis vs worsening of underlying malignancy.patient was initially put on steroids to treat radiationpneumonitis in addition the antibiotics as above to coverhospital acquired bacterial pneumonia.  patient's oxygenrequirement increased overnight on hd 3 and so treatment for pcppneumonia was started with high dose bactrim.  steroids werealtered to treat pcp rather than radiation pneumonitis.  betaglucan and galactomannan were also sent on hd 2.   once patient was made comfort measures only, antibiotics andsteroids were discontinued, and focus was turned towardscontrolling tachypnea and dyspnea with morphine andalbuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.  patient was kept on shovelmask and nasal cannula and was given morphine as needed forassistance with breathing.   family requested to have oxygen removed, and start morphinedrip.  drip started, and nasal cannula/shovel mask removed andpatient expired within 30 minutes.# right mca stroke: on hd 3, housestaff was called to bedsidefor acute change in patient's breathing.  patient was noted tohave left sided neglect in addition to complete left sidedhemiplegia.  a code stroke was called and a ct of the headshowed a non-hemorrhagic stroke in the right mca, adjacent toprior stroke.  tpa was not given as neurology felt that it washigh risk for re-bleed of prior stroke.  patient was started onaspirin 325mg, however, once decision was made to make patientcomfort measures only, aspirin was discontinued.# insomnia: patient struggled with insomnia throughoutadmission.  he was prescribed olanzapine in the outpatientsetting which helped him sleep at doses of 15mg qhs.  with theassistance of palliative care, patient was continued onolanzapine 10mg qhs.  he was also given morphine as needed forcomfort as part of his difficulty sleeping was secondary to histachypnea.# goals of care: several goals of care discussions occurredduring hospitalization.  following patient's stroke, he and hisfamily decided that they wanted him to be comfort measures onlyand to go home with hospice.  however, patient developedincreased work of breathing and family requested morphineboluses.  patient was made comfortable with morphine boluses,then morphine drip and expired at 07:11am on [2160-12-11].medications on admission:1. atenolol 100 mg qd2. atorvastatin 20 mg qd3. doxazosin 4 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (at bedtime).4. fluoxetine 40 mg
