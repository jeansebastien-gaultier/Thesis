diuril500 mg once a day; digoxin 0.625 mg oncea day; colace 100 mg twice a day; aldactone 25 mg once a day;torsemide 100 mg in the morning , 15 mg in the p.m.; k-dur 100 q.a.m.physical examination: general: alert and oriented , in nodistress. she was comfortable. evidence oflabored breathing. her pulse was tachycardic at 103 withrespiratory rate of 20 and blood pressure of 84/58. hertemperature was 98.2. she had diminished radial pulsesbilaterally. she had borderline proptosis with a jugular venousdistention at the angle of the jaw. she had no bruits and nothyromegaly. she had a loud s3 and s4 with a dynamic precordiumand a displaced pmi with a quiet mr. she had a palpable s4. herrespiratory examination showed her lungs were markedly clear topercussion and auscultation without wheeze. abdomen was mildlydistended without evidence of shifting dullness. bowel sounds werenormal. she had an inverted umbilicus. she had no peripheraledema and good peripheral pulses.chest x-ray showed a large globular heart without fluid in thebases with mild upper lobe venous diversion. electrocardiogramshowed normal sinus rhythm with a left axis and ventricularconduction defect and left ventricular hypertrophy high voltage.laboratory data: sodium 140 , potassium 3.6 , white count 6.6 ,hematocrit 37.9. cardiac enzymes were normal. inote her right catheterization results of 10/22/99 showed a meanright atrial pressure of 12 , right ventricular pressure of 38/14 , amean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 21 with a cardiac indexof 2.88 , and a cardiac output of 4.93 and an svo of 1022.impression: this was a 49 year old lady with dilatedcardiomyopathy , probably familial in nature , withincreased abdominal girth and shortness of breath , on thetransplant list , admitted for diuresis , plus or minus optimizationtherapy.hospital course: she was initially treated with b.i.d. lasix 200mg iv and had an excellent diuresis on thisregimen. we increased her aldactone to 50 mg once a day to try andobtain better potassium control and eventually we added metolazoneat 2.5 mg in the morning. during her admission she had a verysignificant improvement with negative diuresis of almost 2 litersevery day for the past 3 days. she had a cortisol stimulationtests which revealed normal synthetic adrenal function and she hada normal tsh. she required extensive potassium repletion duringher stay and she is discharged on 120 total of k-dur per day.during her hospital stay her glucoses were over 250 for a shortperiod of time and it was felt that it was probably appropriate tostart her on oral hypoglycemics. however in the setting ofchanging her diuretic medications and a hospital diet , this wasconsidered this could be delayed until her next outpatient visitwith dr. weiglebdischarge medications: colace 100 mg b.i.d.; amiodarone 200 mgq.d.; digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.; m.v.i.therapeutic 1 tablet q.d.; k-dur 14 meq t.i.d.; aldactone 50 mgq.d.; torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.; zaroxolyn 2.5 mg q. o.d.; coumadin 5mg q. h.s.condition upon discharge: stable.disposition: to home with vna for coumadin , potassium checks andintravenous 200 mg of lasix p.r.n.followup: she will follow up with dr. pucket next wednesday andshe will have her potassium checked tomorrow in the cmcolaboratory , result of which will be forwarded to dr. gracia and anynecessary change to her k-dur therapy will be managed therefrom.dictated by: olen wardsworth , m.d. cc97attending: orville j. sherick , m.d. sr20hq836/8791batch: 78443 index no. fvmi3q6bft d: 4/30t: 4/15cc: 1. karl m. dettman , m.d. nn12. marquis a. roethel , m.d. sr203. medical record dept parkathens- talch hospital[report_end]
