mdprincipal diagnosis:urosepsis.list of problems:1. urosepsis.2. hypoxic respiratory failure.3. pneumonia.4. aspiration.5. pulmonary embolism.6. diabetes.7. obstructive sleep apnea.8. spinal sarcoidosis.history of present illness:the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of spinalsarcoidosis with secondary paraplegia who presented with alteredmental status , hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension. hewas doing well until the morning of 1/22/2006 when he complainedof difficulty breathing and his wife placed him on home cpapmachine that he usually uses at night. despite being placed onthe machine , he was still having air hunger and complaining offeeling unwell. his wife also noted him to have increasinglethargy and decreased responsiveness and called ems to have himbrought to the emergency room. he also was noted to have adecreased urine output from his chronic suprapubic catheter x2days. in the emergency room , he was found to be unresponsive ,grunting , and in respiratory distress. his initial room airsaturation was in the high 60's to low 70's. he was placed on100% nonrebreather with some improvement of his saturations inthe low 90's and an abg of 7.37/43/77 on 100% nonrebreather. hewas therefore intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure. hebecame hypotensive with intubation despite using etomidate withblood pressures in the 60's/40's , and an initial cvp of 16 , so hewas started on levophed with a systolic blood pressure in the130's on 7 to 10 of levophed. he received 1 liter of iv fluid.he received a head ct without contrast that showed no acutebleeding or acute infarction. he had a chest x-ray that showedno obvious infiltrate. his inr was found to be elevated. giventhe ct of his abdomen without contrast that showed a suprapubiccatheter obstruction with bilateral hydronephrosis and distendedbladder. his creatinine was 2.9 , elevated from his baseline of0.9. urology was consulted to change the suprapubic cathetertube and pus was noted to be aspirated from the suprapubiccatheter. he was started on vancomycin , gentamicin , flagyl , andstress dose steroids , and blood and urine cultures were sent inthe emergency and he was transferred to the micu.past medical history:sarcoid disease 20 years ago , paraplegia x18 years , chronicsuprapubic catheter/ostomy for 12 years , diabetes type ii , rightdvt , on coumadin , status post chronic uti , and cpap at night forobstructive sleep apnea.home medications:include regular insulin sliding scale a.c. and at bedtime , nph 54units in the morning and 68

pressure 136/67 ,his o2 saturation was 100% on ac 700 with peep of 5. in general ,he was intubated and responsive to simple commands. heent:sluggish pupils. his lungs were clear anteriorly. his heart wasin regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops. hisabdomen was obese , large , soft , nondistended and nontender , withpositive bowel sounds. his extremities had chronic venous stasischanges of right and lower extremities with areas of no skinbreakdown. he had a large sacral decubitus ulcer with boneexposed that was foul smelling on his sacrum. he wasneurologically moving all four extremities and followingcommands. he had an ostomy and suprapubic catheter in place.laboratory studies:notable for an elevated creatinine of 2.9 , otherwise , his chem-7was within normal limits. his lfts were within normal limits.his hematocrit was 34.6 , his white count was 9.4 , and hisplatelets were 343 , 000. he had negative cardiac enzymes. hisurine and blood tox screens were negative. his ua wassignificant for 3+ protein , trace glucose , negative ketones , 3+leukocyte esterase , negative nitrites , 4-10 red blood cells , 4+bacteria , and 3+ triple phosphate crystals. his ekg was innormal sinus rhythm with an old right bundle-branch block andleft axis deviation , first-degree av block. his chest x-rayshowed retrocardiac opacity that was thought to be aspirationversus pneumonia. abdominal and chest ct showed bibasilarairspace opacities , left greater than right , with aspirationversus pneumonia , bilateral hydronephrosis , severe decubitusulcers , and large gastrohepatic lymph nodes slightly enlarged andcalcified.assessment:this is a 66-year-old man with spinal sarcoidosis and secondaryparaplegia , who presented with altered mental status , hypoxemicrespiratory failure , and hypotension , who had urosepsis andpneumonia and found later on admission to have pulmonaryembolism.hospital course by problem:1. hypoxemia: he was intubated at the time of admission andextubated a day later on 5/9/2006. bipap was used at night ashe had used at home for a sleep apnea with o2 saturations in thehigh 90's on room air during the day. he was initially treatedfor pneumonia with ceftazidime , levofloxacin , and vancomycin.the vancomycin was discontinued on 4/3/2006 , and theceftazidime was discontinued on 2/4/206. his levofloxacin wascontinued at 500 mg per day for a total 10-day course on6/10/2006. this is to be used for a uti and pneumonia. on2/23/2006 , the patient was supposed to go home and found to havea desaturation to high 80's on room air. he was found to have achest x-ray within normal limits. a pulmonary embolism ct wasdone that demonstrated a small nonocclusive pulmonary embolism inthe posterobasilar segment of the right lower lobe with involvingright lower lobe infarct suggestive that he had had a pe that wasresolving. at this time , his inr had been subtherapeutic forthree days at 1.7 to 1.9 and he was continued on his coumadin.the following day , his inr was therapeutic at 2 , and on the dayof discharge , it was 2.2. it was thought that the pe was in thesetting of a subtherapeutic inr. his oxygen requirement was backto baseline at the time of discharge , and his goal inr was to beon the higher end of the 2 to 3 range , which was goal previously.he was also given nebulizer treatments throughout hishospitalization.2. id: his urine was found to have proteus , resistant tomacrobid , and klebsiella , resistant to ampicillin. levofloxacinwas started for this and for the presumed pneumonia seen on chestx-ray for a total of a 10-day course. sputum and blood cultureshave been no growth to date. he had no fevers and no elevatedwhite counts.3. cardiac: he was thought to have an element of autonomicinsufficiency secondary to sarcoid with episodes of hypo andhypertension in the micu. his cortisol stim test was withinnormal limits , it was 14.5 before stim and 23.6 after stim , so hewas not treated with steroids. his blood pressure was in the30's to 160's with pauses in the 100's on the floor with frequentbigeminy and trigeminy and many pvcs , so he was started on 12.5b.i.d. metoprolol on 0/14/2006 with good results. he continuedto have ectopy and continued to be hypertensive , and given hisdiabetes , he was started on a low dose of captopril on 8/14/2006with no complications and was able to maintain blood pressures inideal ranges.4. gu: urology replaces suprapubic catheter early on admission.he was continued to have bladder irrigation with good effect ,and urology signed off on 9/24/2007.5. endocrine: the patient was given nph 20 b.i.d. through hishospitalization and regular insulin sliding scale. his sugarswere high on this reduced regimen and so he was placed on hishome nph doses for discharge.6. decubitus ulcer: plastic surgery was consulted on 1/22/2006and the wound did not look infected. it was debrided andwet-to-dry t.i.d. dressing changes were recommended as well aspanafil t.i.d. dressing changes. he was prescribed panafil to gohome on.7. renal: the creatinine was initially 2.7 , and after receivingiv fluids , it came down to 1.2. he likely had acute renalfailure secondary to postrenal obstructive etiology. hiscreatinine was stable at around 1 for the remainder of hisadmission.8. heme: the patient has a history of dvt. initially , his inrwas found to be therapeutic and he was placed on levofloxacin , sothe plan was that he should have half of his home coumadin dosewhile he was on levofloxacin , so he was given half of dose andhis inrs came down to a nadir of 1.7. his inr was subtherapeuticfor three days , and at that time , a pe was found , his inr was1.8. the day after this , his inr was 2 and then came up to 2.2on the day of discharge. he was discharged on coumadin 5 mg ,which is his home dose to follow up at his coumadin clinic.9. fen: he was placed on maintenance iv fluids until cleared toeat by speech and swallow. speech and swallow estimates havingbaseline aspiration risk and he was known to cough and aspirateat home. he had been recently worked up at the a county medical centeron a recent admission for aspiration pneumonia. they recommendedthickened puree diets and felt that even this he was likely toaspirate. the risks and benefits of eating were explained to hiswife and him and he decided to continue to eat as there was noideal option.10. pain: he continued gabapentin , oxybutynin , andamitriptyline as at home.11. prophylaxis: he was given nexium and coumadin.12. code status: he was full code , which was discussed with hiswife.physical examination at discharge:the current temperature was 98 , the heart rate was 91 to 114 ,blood pressure 100-114/54-70 , respiratory rate of 20 , andsaturating 97-100% on 1-2 liters. in general , he was responsive ,alert , and appropriate. his lungs were clear to auscultationbilaterally. his heart had normal s1 and s2 , soft systolicejection murmur at the right upper sternal border. his abdomenhad positive bowel sounds , distended , soft and nontender. he hada suprapubic catheter as well as an ostomy that were clean , dryand intact. extremities , he had 2+ peripheral edema that wasstable with no skin breakdown.laboratory values:his labs at the time of discharge were stable. his hematocritwas 27.2 , down from 29 , which was closed to his baseline of 34.his inr was 2.1 at the time discharge.discharge medications:amitriptyline 25 mg p.o. at bedtime , vitamin c 500 mg p.o. daily ,baclofen 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , caltrate 600 plus d one tablet p.o.b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , gabapentin 300 mgp.o. t.i.d. , nph human insulin 54 units in the morning , 68 unitsin the evening , regular insulin sliding scale , levofloxacin 500mg p.o. daily , to end on 10/16/2006 for a total course of 10days , magnesium oxide 420 mg p.o. t.i.d. , metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d. , oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. t.i.d. , panafil ointment t.i.d. ,ranitidine 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , and coumadin 5 mg p.o. daily.follow up:the patient will follow up his pcp , dr. dunstan the appointmentwith dr. carros will be within the next week , and theappointment with the coumadin clinic will be tomorrow or the nextday.issues for follow up:include following up on his aspiration risk and continuing todiscourage thin liquids as well as encourage him sitting uprightwhen eating and being observed and stopping when he coughs. hewill need continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoringgiven the new beta-blocker and the ace inhibitor as well asassessment of his frequent pvcs. we will continue to follow hisdiabetes and continue to follow his inr with a goal being 2 to 3with ideal goal on the higher end 8 range.escription document:
