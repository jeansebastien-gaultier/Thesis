testhistory of present illness:pt. is a 68 yo active retired man with hemochromatosis,cirrhosis and dm, who had a mechanical fall 2 weeks prior toadmission while at his winter home in [state 108].  after falling,he developed left sided rib pain (later found to be due to ribfracture), and sought care at the local ed, where he was told totake tylenol. after continuing to have pain for several moredays he returned to the ed and was prescribed motrin for the ribpain. he reports taking 600mg every 4-5 hrs for 3-4 days. healso reports having very diminished appetite and eating anddrinking very little during this time. three days pta, hedeveloped sob. at the urging of his children, he flew back fromfl to be seen here in [location (un) 86]. in addition to decreased pointake, he reported insomnia and nausea/dry heaves.  he deniedabdominal pain, fevers, chills, sick contacts, or travel out ofthe country..on admission, ekg showed right heart strain and possible lateralischemic changes.  pulmonary embolism was considered; v/q scanwas read as low probability. acute coronary syndrome was alsoconsidered, and cardiac enzymes were elevated with troponin 0.12and mb index 14.8. heparin gtt was started, along with asa andbeta blocker. also on admission, he was found to have lacticacidosis in setting of arf (creatinine 3.4 with baseline 1.1)with serum lactate 3.9 --> 6.7 and anion gap of 25.  serumpotassium was 6.0 and bicarb 12. he was given bicarb gtt foracidosis and kayexelate, insulin and glucose for elevated k..initial temp was 94.4 and cxr showed vague opacity in rml.blood cultures were drawn and levo/vanc started.  in the ed,patient has 2 transient episodes of hypotension which resolvedspontaneously.  he was admitted to the micu.past medical history:pmh:

[2143-1-7]interpretation:ventilation images obtained with tc-[age over 90 ]m aerosol in 8 viewsdemonstrate very heterogenous ventilation with numeroussubsegmental defects bilaterally. perfusion images in the same 8views show numerous small bilateral non-segmental defects. thesedefects are in the same areas as the ventilation defects, butare less prominent. the ap dimension is enlarged, and thediaphgrams are flattened. the chest x-ray is clear.the above findings are consistent with a low probability forpulmonary embolism, but are consistent with copd..#. tte [2143-1-8]conclusions:the left atrium is elongated. the right atrium is moderatelydilated. there is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophywith normal cavity size and systolic function (lvef>55%). due tosuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormalitycannot be fully excluded. the right ventricular cavity ismoderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.there is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with rightventricular pressure/volume overload. the aortic valve leaflets(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. noaortic regurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets arestructurally normal. mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.there is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolichypertension. there is no pericardial effusion.impression: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy withpreserved global systolic function. right ventricular cavityenlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate-severepulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w a primary pulmonaryprocess..#. ecg [2143-1-9]sinus rhythm, right ventricular hypertrophy, diffuse st-t wavechanges with borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal q-tcinterval - could be due in part to right ventricular hypertrophybut clinical correlation is suggested since previous tracing of[2143-1-8], further st-t wave changes present and q-tc intervalappears short..#. ct chest with contrast [2143-1-9]impression:1. right loculated collection which has high ct attenuationvalue and may represent either empyema or hemorrhage withinpleural effusion.2. right lower lobe opacity with bronchial wall thickening whichmay represent pneumonia/aspiration.3. right basilar atelectasis.4. small left pleural effusion.5. ground-glass opacity in the right apex. this should befollowed up with a ct in three months.6. focal ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe and rightlower lobe may represent infectious/inflammatory etiology. thiscould also be followed up on the ct which will be obtained inthree months.7. atherosclerotic coronary calcifications.8. gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.9. liver granulomas..#. renal us [2143-1-10]:findings: the right kidney measures 9 cm in length, previouslymeasuring 9.5 cm. the left kidney measures 10.2 cm in length,previously measuring 10.7 cm in length. in the interpolar regionof the right kidney, there is an area with lobulated appearanceconsistent with cortical scarring, unchanged from the priorstudy. in the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is atiny cortical crystal. there is no hydronephrosis, stones, orrenal masses. there is no perirenal fluid. the bladder isunremarkable.impression:1. slight interval decrease in size in both kidneys.2. there is no hydronephrosis.3. stable area of cortical scarring in the right kidney..#. tee [2143-1-15]conclusions:1. the left atrium is dilated.2. the left ventricular cavity size is normal. due to suboptimaltechnicalquality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fullyexcluded. overall left ventricular systolic function isdifficult to assess but is probablynormal.3. there are complex (>4mm) sessile atheroma in the aortic arch.there are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.4. the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. no aorticregurgitation is seen.5. the mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. trivialmitralregurgitation is seen.6. there is a small pericardial effusion.7. no evidence of endocarditis seen..#. cta chest [2143-1-16]:1. no evidence of pulmonary embolism.2. unchanged right loculated collection within the pleural spaceof hyperattenuation. given the appearance with increasedsubpleural fat, this has the appearance of chronic righteffusion. it is difficult to comment on possible thickening ofthe pleura.3. small left simple effusion, slightly increased from the priorstudy.4. 3-mm nodule in the right middle lobe. in the absence of knownmalignancy, one-year ct followup could be considered.5. atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.6. cirrhosis of the liver, with low-attenuation oval lesion nearthe dome. it is incompletely characterized on the study.7. gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis.8. left lateral fifth and seventh rib fractures.9. cystic structure above the manubrial notch withoutenhancement, incompletely characterized on this study..#. core biopsy of r solid pleural effusion [2143-1-17].#. stress test [2143-1-21]exercising stress test: no anginal symptoms or ecg changes frombaseline. npersantine mibi: left ventricular cavity size is normal. restingand stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptakethroughout themyocardium. gated images reveal normal wall motion. thecalculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 71%. no priorstudies are available for comparison. impression: normalmyocardial perfusion. ef 71%.brief hospital course:#. anion gap acidosis:was likely due to lactic acidosis given his high lactate onadmission. high lactate production likely occurred [1-17] sepsisand poor perfusion, and arf prevented clearance of lactate. wastreated with bicarb in the ed and gap resolved..#. hyperkalemia: resolved after receiving kayexelate, insulinand glucose in ed..#. rv strain/pulmonary hypertension:on [1-8] tte was obtained and showed a dilated rv with severeglobal free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement. hewas also noted to have moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolichypertension consistent with a primary pulmonary process.  lvefwas >55%. elevated tropinins measured in the ed were thought tobe due to rv strain combined with decreased renal clearance. by[1-9], troponin had trended down and heparin gtt wasdiscontinued. for his pulmonary hypertension observed on echo, apulmonary consult was obtained. acute pe was thought to be anunlikely cause of his echo findings given the negative v/q scanon admission, but chronic pe was thought to be a possibility.cta was obtained on [1-16], which was negative. other etiologieswere considered, including porto-pulmonary hypertension fromcirrhosis. hiv, [doctor first name ] and rf were sent and found to be negative.scleroderma antibody test is pending. he will undergo anoutpatient work-up for pulmonary hypertension with pfts, sleepstudy, and outpatient appointment with dr. [first name4 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) ]..#. hypoxia:the patient was dyspneic on admission, and was maintained onsupplemental oxygen for oxygen saturations that dropped into thehigh 80's at rest on room air. this was thought to be related toa presumed rml pneumonia (seen as opacity on admission cxr) andunderlying pulmonary hypertension seen on echo. however, theopacity observed on cxr was not seen on ct from [1-16], so it isunlikely that the original opacity represented a pneumonia asoriginally thought. his dyspnea slowly improved, and he wasweaned from supplemental oxygen by [1-14]. however, on [1-15] heagain developed an oxygen requirement after iv fluids wereinitiated in preparation for receiving iv contrast, and on [1-16],resting oxygen saturation was measured at 89% on room air atrest, 85% while ambulating. cta [1-16] showed an enlargedleft-sided pleural effusion (fluid density) and a r-sidedpleural effusion that was determined to be solid onthorocentesis (path result is pending). these findings, incombination with his pulmonary hypertension and deconditioningwere thought to account for the patient's continued hypoxia.diuresis was initiated the following day, and satrurationsimproved, but he continued to have an oxygen requirement. he hadalso been noted to have worsened dyspnea while ambulating, and astress test was performed to rule-out an anginal component.stress test was normal, showing no ecg changes or anginalcomponent and normal myocardial perfusion with ejection fractionof 71%. by discharge, oxygen saturations were 98% on 3l, and hewas discharged home on 2l oxygen via nasal cannula..#. acute renal failure:on admission, the patient had a creatinine level of 3.4. thisappeared to be related to a prerenal state, as supported by hishistory of very poor po intake x 10 days and fena<1%. thepossibility of atn from nsaids was also considered given hisrecent history of taking motrin for pain, and renal followed thepatient until cr had improved. renal ultrasound showed nohydronephrosis. creatinine slowly improved with ivf and time,and had decreased to 1.2 by [1-16] (most recent baselinemeasurement was 1.1 in [2140]). when the patient's home diureticswere subsequently restarted for hyponatremia and fluid overload,cr rose again to 1.6. by discharge, the patient's creatinine was1.4..#. staph bacteremia:blood cultures on admission grew mssa (4/4 bottles from [1-7]).renally-dosed vancomycin was started on [1-8], then switched tooxacillin on [1-10] when sensitivities returned. 2/2 bloodcultures from [1-10] also grew staph aureus. surveillance culturessince then have been negative. tee done [1-15] not show anyvalvular abnormalities. a picc line was placed on [1-12] and thepatient completed a 14-day course of iv antibiotics on [2143-1-22]and the picc was removed prior to discharge..#. hyponatremia:while in the icu, the patient had one set of serum chemistrieswith serum sodium of 122. remainder of values were in 130s untilfluids were started on [1-14] in preparation for cta with dyeload. next measured na was 127 on [1-16]. he was fluid restrictedto 1500cc/day and encouraged to improve his food intake, whichhad been poor throughout his admission. given that he also hadevidence of total body fluid overload (peripheral and abdominaledema), he was restarted on his home diuretic regimen of lasix20mg and spironolactone 25mg. by [1-22], na had risen to 131..#. uti:urine labs from [1-9] showed uti, for which the patient wastreated with a 7 day course of levofloxacin that finished on[1-16]. urine cx was negative, but was sent after the patient hadstarted levofloxacin and vancomycin. fever curve remained flat..#. anxiety: the patient consistently reported having a "nervousstomach" that felt like it had "knots in it." he has had thesesensations for many years, and reported that it made eatingdifficult because it caused him to feel nauseus. this wasthought to be a manifestation of anxiety, and the patient wastried on 0.5mg of ativan. this was subsequently discontinuedwhen he was found to be excessively somnolent. the patientagreed to start remeron for help with anxiety and appetitestimulation. he tolerated it well and was discharged on 15mgremeron qhs..#. dm: the patient recived qid finger sticks and was treatedwith bedtime glargine and iss. blood glucose measurmentsfluxuated with his po intake and adjustments were made asappropriate..#. hypertension/ cad: the patient was treated with asa 325mg andmetoprolol 12.5mg tid. as the patient had no apparent indicationfor digoxin, this was held during his hospitalization. he wasdischarged on atenolol 12.5mg daily and asa 325mg daily. stresstest revealed no hypoperfusion at rest or with persantinestimulation..#. nutrition:albumin was 2.6 on admission, 2.4 on [1-16]. the patient reported a10 day history of anorexia on admission and continued to havepoor po intake throughout most of his hospitalization. he citedlack of appetite and nausea caused by his "nervous stomach" asreasons for his poor intake. the patient was maintained on arenal diet with liquid supplements (boost) tid. he had poorcompliance until 2 days prior to discharge, when he reported anincrease in appetite and improved po intake was recorded..#. hemochromatosis/cirrhosis: remained stable during thishospitalization..#. hypothyroidism: remained stable. he was treated with his homedose of levothyroxine 100 mcg daily during this admission..# physical therapy: the patient was evaluated and followed bypt, who felt he was safe to return to his daugter's home..# prophylaxis:the patient was treated with incentive spirometry, h2 blocker,and sc heparin (which was discontinued when he began ambulating).#. abnormal tests requiring outpatient follow-up:seen
