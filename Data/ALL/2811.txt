[known lastname 107906] bradycardia was likely due to excessivenodal blockade from ccb and bb since he recovered his rate andbp off all nodal blocking agents. he then went back into rapidafib, with hr up to 160s despite the addition of bb. his bpremained stable so the decision was made to attemptcardioversion. tee showed no clot and dccv was attempted but hewas only able to maintain nsr for ~30 sec. he continued to be inafib w/ rvr, with a rate as high as 160-170. diltiazem 30mg poqid was added, still with insufficient control of his rate. thediltiazem dose was then increased to 60mg tid on [1-6] due topersistent tachycardia with good effect on his rate. ep wasconsulted to help guide the management of his arrhythmia andthey recommended discontinuing his diltiazem and insteadattempting to control his rhythm (and rate) with amiodarone. hewas started on 400mg po tid x1 week, with the plan to decreaseto [hospital1 ] dosing x1 week then qd dosing. once he had received anadequate amiodarone load, the plan was to attempt another dccvas an outpatient. mr. [known lastname ] discussed this plan with dr.[last name (stitle) 73] who also wanted him to wear [initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) ] of hearts monitorupon discharge. mr. [known lastname ] was instructed in the use of [initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) ]of hearts monitor and was told to send in rhythm strips to dr.[last name (stitle) 73] daily, so his rate and his intervals could bemonitored daily. despite the initiation of amiodarone, mr.[known lastname ] also needed a beta-blocker to keep his rate undercontrol. his beta-blocker was slowly increased up to 75mg po qidand was then switched to toprol xl 300mg po qd prior todischarge. the toprol xl and amiodarone allowed mr. [known lastname ] toachieve a resting heart rate of 90-100s. coumadin was started on[1-4] with a goal inr of [1-7]. he was kept on a heparin gtt untilhis inr was therapeutic. he was discharged on 3mg of coumadindaily, and his inr on discharge was 2.4.. pump: although mr. [known lastname ] had no evidence of heart failure byexam (lungs were ctab and his jvp was flat), his osh echo andtee here showed a depressed ef. after receiving ivf in the er,he had some swelling in his hands and feet which resolved on itsown. he never required diuresis with lasix.. ischemia: mr.
