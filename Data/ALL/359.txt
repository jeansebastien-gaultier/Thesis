[first name8 (namepattern2) 333][last name (namepattern1) ] for details of this operation.notably, during the course of this operation her course wascomplicated by a aspiration upon anesthesia induction.approximately 2 liters of gastric content was estimated tohave entered the lungs and was rapidly suctioned out;however, attempts at extubation failed, and the patient wasultimately transferred to the intensive care unit with apresumed diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndromesecondary to her aspiration.on [2128-10-31], the patient was maintained intubated inthe intensive care unit.  on postoperative day one, thepatient was converted to a prone position in the intensivecare unit to help improve her respiratory status.  thisgradually improved.  the patient was returned to a supineposition on postoperative day two.  she was gradually weanedfrom the ventilator over the next several days until she wasextubated on postoperative day eight.on postoperative day seven, pseudomonas pneumonia was grownfrom her tracheal tube.  she was started on ceftazidime andzosyn that was ultimately converted from zosyn tociprofloxacin.  tube feeds were started on postoperative dayeight and were brought to goal by postoperative day thirteen.the patient was transferred to the floor on [2128-11-12].just prior to discharge to the floor, it was noted that shehad swelling in her right arm.  an ultrasound was undertakento rule out deep venous thrombosis.  a thrombus was seenwithin the distal jugular vein; consistent with deep venousthrombosis from the right brachial vein to the subclavian.the patient was started on a heparin drip at that time, andover the next several days was converted toward coumadin.  atthe time of discharge, however, she was not therapeutic onthe coumadin; potentially from interference from theantibiotics she was on, so the patient was ultimatelydischarged on lovenox.on the final day of the patient's admission, her port wasaccessed.  she was discharged home on tube feeds at 120 ccper hour times 15 hours.  she was given oxygen therapy;predominately because of anxiety that she was dealing withover feelings of air hunger.  she was also given lovenoxinjections.  all of this was accomplished through the aid ofa visiting nurse who was going to help the patient withdelivery of medications, the lovenox injections, and the tubefeeds, as well as assisting with monitoring coumadin inconcert with the local physician.condition at discharge:  condition on discharge was stable.discharge status:  discharge status was to home.discharge diagnoses:1.  esophageal cancer.2.  status post jejunostomy tube placement and port placementcomplicated by small-bowel obstruction requiringre-exploration and jejunostomy tube revision, complicated byacute respiratory distress syndrome subsequent to aspiration.medications on discharge:  (discharge medications included)1.  enoxaparin sodium 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h.2.  warfarin 5 mg q.d. (crushed and given per jejunostomytube)3.  roxicet elixir 5 cc to 10 cc per jejunostomy tube q.4-6h.as needed.4.  ranitidine 150 mg per jejunostomy tube (as an elixir).5.  sertraline hcl 50 mg per jejunostomy tube q.d.6.  colace elixir 100 mg per jejunostomy tube b.i.d.7.  albuterol 4 puffs inhaled q.4-6h. as needed.8.  tube feeds were also given with impact full strength withfiber at 120 cc per hour.discharge disposition/instructions:   dressing changes wereto be done every day on the jejunostomy tube site per[hospital6 407].  an oxygen tank was also to beprovided to the patient.  at the time of discharge, thepatient was again receiving tube feeds at the above-mentionedrates over the above-mentioned times and was tolerating thiswithout problems.  she was also taking full liquids at thetime of discharge.discharge followup:   follow-up plans included seeingdr.
