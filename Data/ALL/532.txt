[2166-1-8]) admitted with diarrhea.# diarrhea:most likely [1-25] chemotherapy, though infectious cause possible.cdiff was negative.  she was given iv fluids, prn antiemetics,and her electrolytes were corrected prn.  after cdiff wasnegative x 1, she was given symptomatic treatment of herdiarrhea with loperamide.  she continued to have nausea andprofuse diarrhea, and she was given tincture of opium as well asoctreotide.# sepsis:after several days in the hospital, she became acutelyhypotensive, tachycardic and hypoxic.  she was emergentlytransferred to the icu, where ng tube was placed with immediateoutput of almost a liter of feculent material.  she was put onbroad spectrum antibiotics and central line was placed foraggressive fluid repletion.  blood pressure was supported withlevophed.  she was intubated for airway protection given concernfor aspiration pneumonia.  cause of patient's acutedecompensation was unclear.  the team considered infection frombowel source (microperforation, sbp), aspiration event, orpossible pe.  cta was not done given patient's worsening renalfunction and unstable clinical status.surgery was consulted and did not feel that the patient was acandidate for surgical intervention.patient remained intubated and on pressors for several days.antibiotics were selected to cover possible bowel pathogensgiven concern that she could have had microperforations orperhaps sbp given new finding of ascites on imaging.  despiteaggressive care, the patient continued to deteriorate.  herdaughters (and health care proxy) agreed that the patient wouldnot wish to continue aggressive care given her poor prognosis.the decision was made with the attending to make the patientcomfort measures only; she was extubated and died later thatday.patient's daughters agreed that they would want an autopsy tohelp understand what had caused their mother to deteriorate.# acute renal failure - oliguric on arrival to icu. cr quicklyimproved with iv fluids and support of

agreedupon comfort care after discussing the matter with heroncologists, the icu team, and palliative care.# coagulopathy:patient's inr increased during admission despite holdingcoumadin.  dic labs
