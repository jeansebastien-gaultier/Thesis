underlyinginfection. her wound cultures grew mrsa with probes to the bone.x-rays were unrevealing and mri showed severe osteomyelitis. inaddition , the patient had an esr of 109. the patient was thusput on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and flagyl. blood cultures from6/16/06 additionally grew gram-positive cocci in clusters whicheventually yielded mrsa. however , surveillance cultures withtreatment on levofloxacin , vancomycin , and flagyl were negative.the patient received debridement of her left foot on 9/25/06.in the or , the bone looked necrotic and infected. the bone wassent to pathology and microbiology , the results of which arepending. given the appearance of her bone during debridement , itis presumed that the patient will need eight weeks of vancomycin.because she did have a clear source of fevers after it was foundthat she had osteomyelitis , the patient was discontinued offflagyl and levofloxacin on 5/6/06.2. gi: the patient has abdominal pain with gastric emptyingstudy on 6/16/06 showing 0% clearance at 90 minutes consistentwith severe gastroparesis versus obstruction. radiology did notfeel that an upper gi series would give further
