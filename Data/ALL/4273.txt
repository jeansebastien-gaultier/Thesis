[known lastname 1794] is a 65 year-old man with h/o recent hospitalizationand micu stay for bilateral pulmonary embolism complicated byspontaneous intra-hepatic hemorrhage presenting on thisadmission with rle pain and numbness found to have full lengthrle dvt..# right lower extremity dvt:  patient with history of recent b/lpe, complicated by intra-hepatic hematoma on anticoagulation.patient discharged home on recent prior admission with ivcfilter, not on anticoagulation.  on this admission, patientfound to have a large rle dvt.  patient with palpable peripheralpulses bilaterally.  evaluated by vascular surgery in ed, whofelt that his rle was non-threatened and no surgicalintervention was required.  given the risk of extension of dvtto the point where vascular compromise could be reached, as wellas the risk of further extending pes, we cautiouslyanticoagulated the patient with careful monitoring for fear thatthe pt would patient have another hepatic bleed. patient wasadmitted to icu and anticoagulation was started with heparin gttwith goal of 60 - 80.  patient reached the therapeutic level andhis hct remained stable.  serial vascular exams were stable.the rle was elevated and wrapped in ace.  he was then sent tothe regular medicine floor.  however, unfortunately he then hadhis platelets drop, and was found to have heparin inducedthrombocytopenia (see below), and was transitioned to argatrobanfor his dvt.  he was then transitioned to coumadin prior to d/c. his inr was 4.0 on day of discharge, and he was instructed tofollow up with his pcp for further monitoring of his inr with agoal of between [2-3]..# heparin induced thrombocytopenia: patient's platelets droppedfrom 247 on [5-11] to 118 on [2185-5-14], which normally would not fitwith the traditional window for hit, but pt had received heparinon his prior admission also.  hematology was consulted, andrecommended switching to argatroban, which we did.  patient'spf4 test was sent, and returned with an optical density of 2.7,so the lab cancelled our serotonin release assay as the pf4 wasconsidered positive enough.  patient was instructed to get aheparin allergy bracelet with help from his pcp..#  recent subcapsular hepatic bleed: patient with recent icustay requiring massive transfusion protocol followingspontaneous subcapsular hepatic bleed while on anticoagulation.patient discharged home from prior admission on noanti-coagulation.  for this admission, imaging showed that hisliver hematoma had a stable appearance.  surgery was consultedin the ed and recommended no surgical intervention at this time. surgery recommended supportive care should the bleed recur, butpatient remained with stable vss and no ruq abdominal pain..# bilateral pulmonary embolism: patient initially presented withleft sided chest and flank pain when admitted in [2185-4-1].the etiology of emboli is unclear - patient was discharged withplan for outpatient hypercoagulable work-up.  patient dischargedwith ivc filter, not on anti-coagulation.  concern for extensionof pulmonary embolism on this admission as clot extendedproximally above ivc filter.  patient remained mildlytachycardiac throughout the admission, but not hypoxic, dyspnic,and did not have chest pain.  patient's pe's were treated withargatroban when his dvt was treated with argatroban.  hit mayhave contributed to extension of clots above ivc filter.patient will need outpatient anticoagulation w/u, but this iscomplicated by the fact that he is now on coumadin for at least6 months..# h/o [doctor last name 933] disease: previously followed by endocrine at [hospital1 18].per patient not receiving any treatment. denies symptoms orhyper/hypothyroid at this time.  tsh was wnl therefore nointervention undertaken..# hypertension: patient with history of hypertension, and washypertensive on admission. patient had not been takinglisinopril since discharge.  lisinopril was held in the icuwhile anticoagulating given bleeding risk, and patient remainednormotensive there as well as when transferred to the floor.therefore, we did not restart pt's lisinopril at dispo andinstructed him to f/u with his pcp..# dyslipidemia: simvastatin 10mg qhs held after last admissionas patient had transaminitis likely [2-2] subcapsular liver bleed. lfts were wnl.  therefore we restarted simvastatin on thisadmission..# code: full (discussed with patient)pending labs:nonetransitional care issues:patient will need his inr monitored frequently until he isstably threapeutic between 2 and 3.  dr.

[known lastname 1794],you were seen in the hospital for a blood clot in your leg.while you were here, it was determined that you have an allergyto heparin.  you should never be given heparin in the future.please arrange with your pcp to have an allergy bracelet made sothat you aren't given heparin.  you were put on an oral bloodthinner called coumadin, that you will have to continue to takeonce a day until your doctors [name5 (ptitle) ] [name5 (ptitle) ] to stop taking it.we made the following changes to your medications:1) we started you on coumadin (warfarin).  you will take 7.5mgon [5-25], then take 10mg once per day starting on [5-26] until dr.[last name (stitle) ] tells you to change to a different dose.  dr. [last name (stitle) ] willfollow your coumadin levels and adjust your dose of coumadin asneeded.  if you have any questions, you should call him.2) we stopped your lisinopril because your blood pressure isalready well controlled on no anti-hypertensive medications.your pcp may tell you to restart this medication at some point.if you experience any of the below listed danger signs, or anyother new symptom, please call your doctor or go to the nearestemergency room.it was a pleasure taking care of you.followup instructions:department: [hospital1 7975] internal medicinewhen: friday [2185-5-27] at 11:15 amwith: [first name11 (name pattern1) ] [last name (namepattern4) 7978], md [telephone/fax (1) 7976]building: [hospital1 7977] ([location (un) 686], ma) [location (un) ]campus: off campus     best parking: free parking on sitedepartment: hematology/oncologywhen: friday [2185-7-8] at 10:00 amwith: [first name11 (name pattern1) 1730] [last name (namepattern4) 5056], md [telephone/fax (1) 22]building: sc [hospital ward name 23] clinical ctr [location (un) 24]campus: east     best parking: [hospital ward name 23] garage                             [first name5 (namepattern1) ] [last name (namepattern1) ] md [md number(2) 617]
