f/u final read- repeat head ct tomorrow am or if there is any change in neurological exam- neuro checks q4 hours- lvad needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist- check baseline tcds; will further decide whether he needs daily tcd monitoring- to improve perfusion, maximize his sbp as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time- continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke- continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry- romi with serial ce q 8h x3, and serial ekgs.- keep k&gt;4, mg&gt;2- risk factor assessment: esr, crp, hba1c- check blood cultures- check chromogenic factor x level- pt/ot evaluation- hold glypizide xl: use riss for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130thank you for this consult. please page 90395 with any questions or concerns. ___________________________________carol upton m.d.
