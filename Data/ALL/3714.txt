dz, with recent bilateral ileofemoral and renal artery stent (11/24/95) and recent cardiac cath stent to the circumflex (11/28/95). pt presented to osh 12/10 with c/o abdominal pain onset the pm prior to admission, diffuse in nature, localized in the mid-epigastric region, ruq, and luq with a pain scale of 8-10/10 pain. per charts he reported decreased pain in the am with ability to tolerate po's and then increasing pain that afternoon. also associated with diaphoresis, + nausea, no vomiting, no sob. during placement of a central line at osh ed, pt experienced shaking during procedure and had acute loss of motor and sensory strength in the le's. per nursing chart at osh ed, pt given morphine for abd pain (around 4p-8p) with coffee ground emesis at 8pm with subsequent decrease in bp to 76/49 and started on dopamine for pressure support. at the same time, pt c/o numbness in feet. per charts he was reported to be bending forward coughing and vomiting and experienced acute loss of sensation/motor function in the abdomen and lower extremities.course at the outside hospital- 1.neuro- acute loss of sensation/motor at the level of t8. per neurology, had paraplegic legs, no sphincter tone, no anal wink, sx were concerning for aortic dissection. abd us unrevealing but was reported as a poor study. ct of t8-t10 did not show gross deviations of spine, no soft tissue masses or disk bulging.  2.gi- coffee ground emesis at osh, with no fresh blood- with dropping hct 44-40-35 and transfused 1 u prbc on 12/11.  also guiac +.  etiology thought to be 2/2 asa and plavix.  no egd was performed and amlyase and lipase, and lfts were nl per report.  3.id- pt was hypotensive with sbp in the 70's on presentation with good response to fluids, in setting of elevated wbc to 22 pt

pneumonias.	cardiac size normal, no signs of edema or decompensation.	operative changes as before and right subclavian central line as	before without apparent pneumothorax or complication.mri (12/12): examination: mri of the cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine.	examination date: 12/12/95.	comparison films: the prior films are available for comparison to	due pacs technical difficulties. comparison is made with the	report of prior c-spine ct from january 2095.	history:72 year old man with history of paraplegia from traumatic	injury in 2066 with new sensation loss and motor loss below t8.	technique:sagittal t2 images were obtained of the cervical,	thoracic, lumbar spine.  the axial t2 images are obtained from t10	through l1. the images are moderately motion degraded in the	thoracic and lumbar spine.  the cervical spine mri was repeated	three times due to motion. no contrast was used.	findings:	cervical spine:	straightening of the cervical lordosis is noted from c2 through	c6. bone marrow signal demonstrates patchy areas of t2 high signal	within the c4 and c5 vertebral body.  posterior disc osteophyte	complexes are present at c2/c3, c3/c4, c4/c5, c5/c6, c6/c7.	the patient is status post posterior laminectomy and fusion which	causes susceptibility artifact. the laminectomy from c3 through	c7, previously noted, is not well visualized due to motion	artifact and susceptibility.	thoracic spine:	there is partial fusion of t4 to t5 with loss of height of t4 and	focal kyphosis at this area. myelomalacia is noted from t1 through	t5. there is focal t2 high signal within the cord substance at the	t4 level.	t2 low signal collections are noted posterior to the cord at t6	through t12.  a high signal septation is present through this	collection at t7 and extending from t11 through l1. this low t2	signal collection displaces the cord anteriorly from t7 through	t10.	the cord is small from t7 through t10 consistent with myelomalacia	and high t2 signal.	high signal is also present in the cord substance of the distal	thoracic cord and at the conus.	small amount of t2 high signal is noted in encircling the distal	thoracic cord and the spinal roots.	lumbar spine:	straightening of the lumbar spine is noted with grade 1	retrolisthesis of l4 on l5. there is a levoscoliosis with apex at	l4/l5.	disc demonstrates t2 shortening within several lumbar discs and	disc height loss at l4/l5, l5/s1.	t2 high signal at the endplates are noted around the l4/l5 and	l5/s1 disc levels.   moderate to severe stenosis of the bilateral	neural foramen at l5/s1 facet osteoarthritis and disc height loss	of l5/s1 is noted. the patient has had prior surgery of the	spinous processes of l4 and l5.	the conus terminates at l1/l2. the spinal roots appear clumped	centrally and there is t2 high signal around the upper spinal	roots. t2 high signal is noted at the distal aspect of the thecal	sac.impression:	 1.  low t2 signal collections from t6 through l1 with	displacement of the thoracic cord anteriorly from t7 through t10.	the differential diagnosis for this collection includes unusual	flow artifact or multiloculated septations or epidural	collections.  recommend dedicated thoracic and lumbar spine mri	with contrast and t2 axials through the l spine and c spine. if	clinically indicated, consider repeat c spine mri with contrast.	dr. winters was informed of this at 2:15 pm on 12/12/95.	2.  myelomalacia of the thoracic cord from t4-t5 level and at	t7-10.	3.  the spinal roots are incompletely imaged but have a clumped in	appearance suggesting arachnoiditis. repeat axial images through	the entire spinal roots could better evaluate this.	4. degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine at l4/l5 and	l5/s1. degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine at c3/c4	c4/c5 c5/c6.	5.  prior surgical fusion of the cervical spine and laminectomies	are incompletely evaluated on the study due to motion.  please see	prior ct report for the details.	6.  mild focal kyphosis with height loss at t4 appears subacute	and may be from prior trauma.mri (12/13):	mri thoracic and lumbar spine without and with gadolinium	history: history of previous cord compression. status post recent	aorto-bifemoral bypass. now with sudden onset of loss of lower	extremity motor function and sensation.	comparison: mri spine dated 12/12/95.	procedure: multiplanar mr imaging of the entire spine was	performed without and with gadolinium.	findings:	there is an old compression fracture at t5.  there is exaggeration	of the normal kyphosis at this level.  there is no evidence of	marrow edema to suggest acute fracture in the spine.  there is	straightening of the normal lumbar lordosis.  there is grade 1	retrolisthesis of l4 on l5.  there is degenerative change in the	l4-5 and l5-s1 end plates.  there is increased t2 signal in the	l4-5 and l5-s1 discs however the adjacent endplates are well	preserved, and although infection cannot be completely excluded,	it is considered very unlikely.  there is a small central disc	protrusion at t8-9.	there is no evidence of significant canal stenosis in the thoracic	or lumbar spine.	examination of the cord demonstrates myelomalacia extending from	the t5 level inferiorly.  there is prominent flow artifact in the	csf surrounding the myelomalacic cord.  the conus is expanded and	demonstrates hyperintensity on t2 weighted sequences.  there is no	associated enhancement.  no vascular flow voids are identified.	there is a small right pleural effusion.  there is consolidation	at the right lung base.  this may represent atelectasis or	infiltrate and correlation with chest x-ray is recommended.impression:	expansion and signal abnormality in the conus superimposed on	chronic myelomalacia. the differential diagnosis includes cord	infarction, and demyelinating disease.  vascular malformation and	neoplasm are considered less likely due to the absence of vascular	flow voids and abnormal enhancement.mra:  mra of the aorta with runoff was conducted as per departmental	protocol.	findings:	due to the nature of mri imaging, dedicated sequences were	performed to evaluate the vasculature. the remainder of the	abdominal organs are not fully evaluated and if clinically	indicated, directed sequences could be performed.	this was a technically limited study due to suboptimal contrast	bolus and movement.  the patient was agitated and unable to	cooperate .	no evidence for an aortic dissection is identified.	there is moderate stenosis of the left subclavian artery just	beyond its origin.	the celiac trunk is patent.	there is mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the	superior mesenteric artery.	the renal arteries cannot be assessed on this study.impression:	1.  limited study due to technical factors and patient movement	however no evidence of an aortic dissection is identified.  a	repeat mri with better contrast bolus and sedation may be obtained	if clinically indicated.	2.  moderate stenosis is noted just distal to the origin of the	left subclavian artery.3.	mild/moderate stenosis just beyond the origin of the
