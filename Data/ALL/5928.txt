[due to acoustic shadowing, theseverity of mitral regurgitation may be significantlyunderestimated.] the left ventricular inflow pattern suggests arestrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrialpressure. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. thesupporting structures of the tricuspid valve arethickened/fibrotic. moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation isseen. there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.there is no pericardial effusion.impression: severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy;small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolicdysfunction; at least moderate (and probably significantly more)mitral regurgitation[9-9] ct abd/pelvis with iv contrast:ct of the abdomen with iv contrast: a left pleural effusion withassociated atelectasis is stable. the lung bases are otherwiseclear. the liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, andkidneys appear unremarkable. note is again made of a small rightrenal hypodensity measuring 6 mm, likely representing a renalcyst. there is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca.a large left retroperitoneal hematoma, now measures 8(transverse) x 7 (ap) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing formeasurement differences, has not changed in size compared to theprior study in terms of size. no areas of active extravasationare noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of theretroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging.no new hemorrhage is identified. the abdominal portions of thelarge and small bowel are unremarkable. heavy calcification ofthe abdominal aorta is noted, and a focal area of stenosis atthe level of the pancreas is additionally noted.ct of the pelvis with iv contrast: evaluation of the pelvis islimitedsecondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis. a foleyballoon ispresent within the bladder. the rectum and sigmoid colon aregrosslyunremarkable.impression: large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentiallyunchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hoursprior. no ct evidence of active extravasationbrief hospital course:acute on chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy: despitemultimodality pain regimen, the patient's pain remained poorlycontrolled, except when treated with ketorolac. unfortunately,this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman withadvanced age, mildly reduced renal function, and on warfarin andplavix. a pain consult was obtained, but they did not add muchto the present management.mri of ls spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement,cauda equina or canal stenosis, but incidental note was made ofa possible left pelvic mass. this was further evaluated byct.......it is possible that some of the pain and weakness may berelated to an iliopsoas process..acute renal failure: related to nsaid's and dehydration..paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: continue warfarin goal inr [12-31].coronary artery disease: stable - plavix, statin, toprol.osteoporosis: vitamin d, q month bonivahypertension: continue outpatient medications____________________________________[hospital unit name 153] course and subsequent medical service course:this is a [age over 90 ] year-old female with a history of afib, cva, cadinitially admitted on [9-5] with worsening low back pain whobecame hypotensive to 80's systolic this evening. of note, thismorning she had a ct scan that showed an rp bleed. this wasthought to be [12-30] increased inr and she was given 1 mg scvitamin k and 2 mg po vitamin k. no recent procedures. no changein medications. her coumadin was given on [9-5] but held since[9-6] because of increased inr. she also is hyponatremic whichwas thought to be iatrogenic from d51/2 ns maintenance fluidsgiven continuously despite an initial sodium of 128 onadmission. her urine lytes show urine na < 10 and osm >300. hersodium is up from 117-->121 with ns bolus. patient herself feelswell. she denies lh, dizziness, cp, palp, sob, abd pain, nausea,vomiting, back pain.  on the floor, she was given 2 u ffp, 1 uprbcs and 500 cc normal saline bolus. she initially improvedwith sbp high 90s to low 100s. bp recheck an hour later was inthe 80s again and her crit prior to blood transfusion came backat 16 so she was transferred to the icu for hypotension andbleed..in the icu, her initial vs were: t 96 bp 122/49, hr 79, o2 sat96% ra, r 16. she reported feeling well. denied lh, dizziness,cp, sob, abd or back pain.[age over 90 ] year-old female with a history of cad, cva, afib on coumadinwith supratherapeutic inr presented with hypotension in settingof rp bleed and hematocrit drop.#. rp bleed: seen on ct scan.  repeat ct-scan w/ contrast didnot show expansion of the hematoma or evidence of active bleed.likely in setting of elevated inr ??????
