(pt attributes the pain to gas as the belching coincident with the ntg also seemed to relieve the pain).  he does also report an increase in sob after walking up one flight of stairs which has arisen over the past few months.pmh: dm x 20 years, peripheral neuropathyhtncadanteroseptal mi in 03/91, ptca and stentef 32% (last echo 2092)hemorrhoids (normal colo 2095)iritis, corneal dystrophyosteoporosisdiverticulosis (?)meds:  	glipizide 2.5 qdasa  325 qdlisinopril 5mg qdlopressor  50 mg bidlipitor  10 mg qdamitryptilline  25 mg qhsprednisone gttcaltrate + d (calcium carbonate 1500 mg (600 mg elem ca)/ vit d 200 iu)  1 tab po bidall:  	acetaminophen--rashsh:  		tob:  	43 year pack hx, quit 2060	etoh:	denies	illicits:	 deniesfh:  	mother:  pernicious anemiafather:  died in accident at young agebrother:  leukemiaros:	as in hpi.  -	general: no weight loss/gain, no fatigue, no fevers, no chills, no change in appetite-	respiratory: no cough, no sob, no doe, no hemoptysis, no wheezing-	heent: no neck stiffness, no hoarseness, no hearing loss-	cardiac: chest pain/pressure as above, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no pnd-	gastrointestinal: no nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation, no bleeding-	neurologic: diminished sensation in lle bilaterally-	lymph nodes: no enlarged lymph nodes-	musculoskeletal: no back pain, no neck pain, no leg pain, no arm pain-	urologic: no hematuria, no dysuria, no polyuria, no nocturia -	hematologic: no bruising, no bleeding-	exposures: no sick contacts, no recent travel  exam:  	 	vs:  	97.7  74 18  98%  supine 108/54 standing 127/70heent: nc/at, perrl, nonicteric.  eomi, no nystagmus. mmm, w/o exudates.dicks hall pike maneuver elicited neither nystagmus nor symptomsneck:  	supple, nt, full rom, 2+ carotids w/o bruits, no lad. jvp 7cmlungs:  ctab;
