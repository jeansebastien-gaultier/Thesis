0/28with frequent atrial premature beats , short bursts ofsupraventricular tachycardia with occasional periods of junctionaltachyarrhythmia , and aivr which correlated with the symptoms. anecho in 0/28 showed a normal lvf with minimal mitral regurgitationand systolic bowing. on exercise tolerance test at the time , shewent seven minutes stopping with symptoms of fatigue. her maximalheart rate was 76% and she had 1 mm st elevations consistent withbut not diagnostic of ischemia. she was then managed on procanalone with good result for her arrhythmia. she was previously ondigoxin but no

supple , 2+ carotids without bruits , and jugularvenous pressure was 5 cm. lungs: clear. cardiac: she had anon-displaced point of maximal intensity , regular rate and rhythm ,and normal s1 and s2 without murmurs , rubs , or gallops. abdomen:soft , non-tender , and non-distended. rectal: guaiac negative inthe emergency ward. extremities: negative for cyanosis and edemaand 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. neurological:non-contributory.laboratory examination: her sodium was 141 , potassium of 4.5 ,creatinine of 0.7 , her ldh was 290 , herfirst cpk was 53 , cholesterol was 222 , pa was less than assay , hernapa was 1.0 , chest x-ray showed no evidence of congestive heartfailure or cardiomegaly , and her ekg in the coronary care unit wasnormal sinus with 0.15/0.08/0.2 , 0.5 mm st elevations in f , and noq or flipped t waves.hospital course: patient was admitted to the coronary care unit ,put on aspirin q.d. , and kept on heparin. weheld off on a beta blockade given her heart rate which was oftenless than 50 with a systolic blood pressure of 80 to 90. herintravenous nitroglycerin was weaned off and she was given somefluid boluses secondary to the low blood pressure. we started heron simvastatin for her cholesterol and discussed smoking cessation.she ruled in for a myocardial infarction. her peak ck was 789 withan mb fraction of 79.2 and her troponin was 20. over the course ofseveral days , her cpk drifted down to 695 to 604 with mb fractionof 46.9%. heparin was discontinued on 0/21/96 and the patient , on6/28/96 , had been encouraged to get up and walk around. she didso without any evidence of chest pain , she had no recurrence ofchest pain after this point , and on 0/21/96 , the heparin wasdiscontinued and she continued to be pain free with ambulation. onthe morning of 11/23/96 , she had an exercise tolerance test , amodified bruce , which was positive. she went seven minutes andtwenty seconds stopping due to chest pain. there was no change inher blood pressure , her maximal heart rate was 89 , and the ekgshowed 2 mm st downsloping depressions in v4 and v5 that developedwith exercise and persisted into recovery which was highlypredictive of coronary artery disease. she came back up to thefloor and we discussed doing a catheterization with her. at thetime , we kept her npo. an hour later , she developed 8/10 chestpain that was relieved with one sublingual and she was pain freebefore the ekg could be done , however , thirty minutes after that ,she again developed 8/10 chest pain. an ekg showed 2-3 mm stelevations in v4 through v6 with pseudonormalization of t waves inii , iii , avf , and v3 through v6. her pain decreased to 6/10 , shehad been restarted on heparin , and put on intravenous nitroglycerinwith her blood pressure tolerating it. she was given sixsublinguals and 8 mg of morphine without relief of pain , heart ratewas 60 , and blood pressure was 100/60. she was taken to thecatheterization laboratory. the catheterization showed rightatrial pressure of 1 , right ventricle 24/4 , pulmonary capillarywedge of 8 , arterial 110/70 , she had a 50% stenosis in her leftanterior descending , and a subtotal occlusion of her leftcircumflex which was opened with ptca to 20%. she was kept onheparin for another 24 hours following the ptca and then theheparin was discontinued. she remained pain free after her cardiaccatheterization/ptca and was discharged home on 5/28/96 withfollow-up with dr. rumphol . her tsh level was checked given herhistory of hypothyroidism and her tsh was 1.0.disposition: patient's
