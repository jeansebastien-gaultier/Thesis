2/12/07 ): atrial fibrillation at 71 beats per minute ,pseudonormalized.consulting services:1. gastroenterology.2. surgery.hospital course by problem:1. abdominal pain: unclear etiology of abdominal pain onpresentation , but given history of mesenteric ischemia andquestionable small-bowel thickening on ct , the initial concerngi and surgical services were consulted and followed the patient overhospital day #1. serial cbc , lactate and anion gaps werefollowed and showed no evidence of ischemia. by the evening ofhospital day #1 , the patient's abdominal pain had fully resolvedand the patient was initiated on clears. by the morning ofhospital day #2 , the patient was tolerating a regular diet.although no clear diagnosis could be made , the rapid resolutionof the patient's abdominal pain was thought to be most consistentwith viral enteritis. given the patient's history ofatherosclerosis , further imaging of the abdominal vessels by mraduring followup was recommended by the gi service.2. pneumonia: bilateral infiltrates consistent with aspirationpneumonia. the patient was initially treated empirically withceftriaxone , azithromycin and flagyl iv , which was switched tocefpodoxime plus flagyl p.o. on hospital day #2. the patientbecame febrile on hd#4 ( 3/7/07 ) up to 101.9 and as such was switchedback to ceftriaxone , flagyl and azithromycin iv afterwhich the patient remained afebrile throughout the remainder ofher admission. the patient was discharged on 10/25/07 withinstructions to complete an additional six days of cefpodoxime ,flagyl and azithromycin p.o. for a total of 14 days of antibiotictherapy. the patient was also given lactobacillus as a probioticagent.3. hypoxemia: the patient was noted in the ed to have a mildoxygen requirement with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air ,which improved to 97% on 2 l nasal cannula. the differentialdiagnosis for the patient's hypoxemia included pulmonary edema( seen on chest x-ray ) and pneumonia. the patient was given 40 mgiv lasix in the emergency department and was treated forpneumonia as above. on hospital day #2 , the patient's at restroom air oxygen saturation was noted to be 95-97% , but decreasedto 85% with ambulation on room air. the patient was stillthought to be mildly hypervolemic and was gently diuresed. onthe day of discharge , the patient was noted to have a room airsaturation of 100% at rest and 95% with ambulation. the patientwas instructed to continue gentle oral diuresis at home and vnaservices were arranged to monitor her oxygen saturations and daily weight.4. anemia: history of gi bleeding , chronic renal insufficiency.the patient's hematocrit was stable at baseline 33-36 throughouther hospital admission. the patient was guaiac negative onadmission. an active type and screen was maintained throughoutadmission. no evidence of gi bleeding throughouthospitalization. the patient's hematocrit was 37.7 on admissionand 33.5 at discharge. the patient was given her weekly procrit5000 units subcutaneous injection on 10/25/07 prior to discharge.the patient was instructed to resume iron supplementation afterdischarge.5. chf: the patient's admission chest x-ray was suggestive ofpulmonary edema , possibly secondary to elevated blood pressure inthe setting of abdominal pain versus insufficient diuresis athome. there was no evidence of acute ischemia on ekg. thepatient was gently diuresed during her admission. the patient'sdry weight is 57 kg. the patient's weight at discharge was 61kg. repeat chest x-ray on the morning of discharge still showedevidence of pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema. assuch , the patient was thought to be still mildly hypervolemic atthe time of her discharge and was instructed to continue gentlediuresis at home. the patient was discharged on lasix 80 mg p.o.twice daily , which is a slight increase from her home dose of 80mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. the patient was instructed to measureher weights daily and to follow up with her cardiologist , dr.michele , for further titration of her diuretic dose.6. hypertension: the patient's blood pressure was elevated inthe ed up to 183/65 in the setting of abdominal pain and improvedover several hours to the 110-120s/60s-70s. on hospital day #2 ,the patient's blood pressure was noted to be slightly elevatedfrom 130s-150s/70s. as such , the patient's valsartan and norvascwere restarted on hospital day #2. the patient's imdur wasrestarted on hospital day #4. the patient's blood pressureremained well controlled during the remainder of her admissionranging from 100-122/46-71 on her home regimen.7. atrial fibrillation: with pseudoregularization. thepatient's rate was noted to be well controlled. the patient'scoumadin was held in the setting of a supratherapeutic inr likelysecondary to concurrent antibiotic use. thepatient's inr trended down to 2.1 on hospital day #4 and she wasrestarted on a reduced dose of coumadin. the patient's inr was2.7 on the a.m. of discharge on coumadin 1 mg nightly while stillon antibiotics as above. vna services were arranged to measureher inr on 7/11/07 and to send the results to the wsmh coumadin clinic ,915-360-5305.7. chronic renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine wasnoted to be at baseline 2.7 on admission and slightlyincreased creatinine to 3.2 at the time of discharge. incontrast , the patient's bun was 83 at discharge , down from 111 onadmission. the patient did not show evidence of contractionalkalosis with bicarbonate=22 on a.m. of discharge. thepatient's bun , creatinine and bicarbonate were to be rechecked on7/11/07 with the results sent to dr banana ( cardiology ) anddr. bechman ( nephrology ) for further titration of her medicationsas needed.8. diabetes: the patient was initially continued on home doselantus and sliding scale insulin. standing novolog insulinq.a.c. was reinitiated as the patient's p.o. intake improved.the patient's lantus dose was titrated up to improve glucosecontrol during admission. however , the patient experiencedintermittent hypoglycemia at increased doses of lantus and wasreturned to her home dose of 8 units subcu nightly. at the timeof discharge , the patient was returned to her home insulinregimen of lantus 8 units nightly plus novolog 4 units withbreakfast , 4 units with lunch and 5 units with dinner plussliding scale insulin. the patient was instructed to continue tomonitor her blood glucose with meals.prophylaxis: teds/coumadin , ppi.code status: full code.contact: florencio kisto , daughter/healthcare proxy ,
