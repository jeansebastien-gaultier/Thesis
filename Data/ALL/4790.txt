however , she continued to bebacteremic. she was then continued on vancomycin and daptomycinper id. linezolid was discontinued on 0/16/06 per id. shemaintained negative blood cultures since 5/22/06.d. atrial fibrillation. the patient is in atrial fibrillationwith rates of 130s on 1/30/06 , was given diltiazem 10 mg x2 thenstarted on iv amiodarone. she converted to sinus rhythm withamiodarone , finished iv load , and continued on 200 mg daily. itwas planned for her to taper from there.5. renal. status post renal transplant on fk , cellcept , andprednisone. the patient had a renal ultrasound , which wasnegative for hydronephrosis , obstruction or infarct. she had arenal transplant biopsy on 3/13/06 , which results indicativemild tubular damage and capillaritis suggestive of humeralrejection. she received ivig x2 , pulse steroids. she progressedto have an increase in her creatinine to 5.7 and decreased urineoutput. the patient was initiated on dialysis on 2/5/06 , againon 7/23/06 , 9/27/06 , and 11/16/06. she then was maintained onmonday , wednesday , and friday schedule for dialysis and wasplaced on renagel for increased phosphate.6. gi. the patient throughout her hospital course hadincreasing abdominal fluid collection with increasing shortnessof breath. she had an abdominal ultrasound to assess her amountof fluids and marked for paracentesis. cis marked the patientfor paracentesis. paracentesis was attempted at the bedside withonly 700 ml of bloody gastric ascites. the patient had minimalimprovement of discomfort. the fluid was sent for gram stain ,ldh , albumin , white blood cell count , and differential. ct ofthe abdomen was consistent with moderate amount of ascites on theright side of the abdomen mildly distended small bowel , questionof an ileus , which began to improve as of 6/24/06.7. neurologically , the patient had a new onset of psychiatricmanic disorder versus organic dementia. her mood and behaviorhad seemed to improve on 8/29/06 ; however , the patientverbalized multiple concerns from 8/1/06 to 3/10/06 aboutimpending , worsening of condition , and possibility of death.8. pulmonary. the patient continued to spike fevers about 103on 0/20/06. chest x-ray had showed left lower lobe pneumonia.id was consulted. the patient was given ceftazidime 2 g iv x1.on 7/9/06 , the patient was transferred out of the micu. shewas hypotensive; however , her cvp line showed a blood pressure of15-20 points higher systolic then what were showing on herperipheral blood pressure cuff. she had nosocomial pneumonia ,which had improved. her ceftazidime was stopped and aztreonamwas stopped. her ileus seemed to be improving. she had a bowelmovement. she also developed hyperbilirubinemia and thereforeamiodarone was stopped. her ng tube was removed. her abdomenremained tight from fluid overload. her dialysis alternatingwith ultrafiltration. fluid form her abdomen grew e. coli , onvancomycin. she was on nexium orally. her feeding tube wasplaced secondary to malnutrition and third spacing. she wasstarted on mepron 10 ml per hour , meropenem was started on3/10/06 for a question of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.plan was for paracentesis on 9/23/06. renally , the patientremained anuric and dialysis dependent. fk was continued andcellcept was discontinued on 5/3/06. the patient continued tohave thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and anemia. in the earlymorning of 5/1/06 , the patient began having large volume emesiswith aspiration. she was transferred to the medical intensivecare unit and resulted in respiratory arrest , pulses , electricalactivity arrest. a code was initiated with intubation. thepatient decompensated and became very hypotensive. despite theefforts of cpr , the patient became profoundly bradycardiac andadvanced to pa again , not responding. after 1.5 hour fr code ,efforts were discontinued. the patient was pronounced at 8o'clock a.m. deceased.escription document: 9-7263011 cssten teldictated by: fundis , dustyattending: tepley , sherwooddictation id 5552099d: 8/15/06t: 1/25/06[report_end]
