none.  ethanol - social. family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, onebrother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brotherdying from melanoma age 36.  the rest of her siblings and childrenhave not heart disease. physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress. blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.  the neck issupple.  jvp flat.  carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft rightgreater than left bruits.  chest is clear.  cardiac exam shows anormal s1, physiologically split s2 and a i/vi systolic ejectionmurmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significantdiastolic murmur.  the abdomen is benign.  extremities reveal noappreciable edema.  peripheral pulses are intact.   electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  pr intervalof .12, qrs .06, qt .36, axis 85 degrees.  there are minornonspecific st-t wave changes.   impression:  mrs. vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history ofvariegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension anddyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.  she has had aretrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and hermost recent stress test approximately one year ago did not showsignificant provokable ischemia.  nonetheless, i am concerned thather clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia. i therefore have scheduled her for an exercise mibi stress test andi will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasivestudies.  in light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulindependent diabetes, i strongly recommend beginning aggressiveantilipemic pharmacologic therapy.  unless her variegata porphyriaprecludes the use of atorvastatin, i would begin this at 10 mg poq.d.  i would target her ldl cholesterol to less than 90.  inaddition, i have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d. andi would consider beginning an ace inhibitor again if herporphyria does not vance, jennifermr #542-66-00-3                    -3-            july 18, 2069 preclude this.  she understands that if she has evidence forsignificant provokable ischemia that i would strongly encourage herto undergo repeat coronary angiography.  thank you very much forallowing me to assist in her care. sincerely yours,   timothy quarterman, m.d. dd: 07/18/69dt: 07/28/dv: 07/18/69 /riggs cc:john koontz, m.d.kearney urology center49 buswell stminerva,  tn  41694 cc:vincent veal, m.d.gastroenterology division -
