present illness :the patient was transferred from an outside hospital in newssatden , admitted there 09/02/94 and transferred 09/05/94 .the patient is a 55 year old woman who has long-standing untreated hypertension and known valvular heart disease .hypertension has not been treated for greater than 2 years secondary to side effects from medication , and the patient is on no regular medications and has not had regular medical care for 5 years since a previous retelk county medical center admission for accelerated hypertension for which she was previously on four medications .cardiac risk factors include a positive family history of a postmenopausal patient but no cigarette use , diabetes or high cholesterol .previous echocardiogram in 1989 showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with 2 to 3+ aortic insufficiency , mild ps , no rwna .recently in good health with no dyspnea on exertion .able to tolerate 2 1/2 hike , mountain climbing .no recent history of chest pain , shortness of breath or congestive heart failure .on 09/02/94 , the patient was playing with nephew and had sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and syncope .found by paramedics , unable to intubate in field .felt to have respiratory arrest related to aspiration and intubated at hospital in tl .the patient was rapidly revived with lasix , morphine and nitrates .initial echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size , concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , possible anteroseptal hypokinesis , moderate to severe aortic insufficiency , ps-30 mm gradient .the patient ruled out for myocardial infarction , hemodynamically stable , had minimal ventricular ectopy and had chest ct with lung infiltrate but no aortic disease and a normal head ct .the patient was transferred to the retelk county medical center for further management .past medical history :childhood heart murmur .severe hypertension .depression .question of history of psychosis in the past .past surgical history :no past surgeries .medications on admission :at the time of admission , the patient was on no medications .allergies :no allergies .medications on transfer :lopressor 25 bid ,

auscultation throughout .cor :carotids 2+ and equal .no bruits .no jugular venous distention .regular rate and rhythm .s1 , s2 with s4 and a iii / vi systolic ejection murmur at left upper sternal border .no diastolic murmurs .no rubs .distal pulses intact without bruits .abdomen soft , non-tender .no hepatosplenomegaly .rectal heme negative .extremities :no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .neurological examination :alert and oriented .central nervous system intact .normal exam , nonfocal .laboratory data :sodium 139 .potassium 3.6 .chloride 103 .bicarb 28 .bun 36 .creatinine 1.2 .glucose 121 .white count 12.7 .platelets 192 .hematocrit 35.9 .pt , ptt normal .mcv 82 .liver function tests normal except for sgot of 57 , ldh 229 .ck &apos;s 85 , 94 , 137 .all labs above from outside hospital .urinalysis normal .ekg with normal sinus rhythm at 78 , leh , left ventricular hypertrophy , deep t-wave inversions 1 and l , v3 through v6 .compared to 1989 , there were no t-wave inversions at that time .chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly , enlarged left hilar shadow with a node that could be vascular or lymph node ct indicated .hospital course :the patient &apos;s management was mainly for hypertension .the patient was started on labetalol and increased captopril with pressures 170 to 180 systolic .no further symptoms .cardiac catheterization showed procedure done 09/08/94 :pulmonary valve stenosis with otherwise normal valve function .rv pressure 80/10 , pap 32/16 , peak pulmonary valve gradient 50 , mean gradient 30 , no significant aortic or mitral stenosis .aortogram 3+ aortic insufficiency , normal motion of leaflets .ventriculogram with mild left ventricular enlargement , normal contractile function .rv gram :no subvalvular stenosis and minimal coronary artery disease .left anterior descending has proximal 30 to 50% stenosis .on admission also , the patient developed a temperature thought to be consistent with left lower lobe infiltrate seen at outside hospital with a peak white count of 17,000 and temperature reduction from 101.5 initially at the outside hospital to 100.4 here .blood urine cultures negative with chest x-ray as previously mentioned , clearing of infiltrate , thought to be chemical aspiration during syncopal episode .the patient had one 10 beat episode of v-tach on admission with normal electrolytes at the time , and there was no further ventricular ectopic activity .the patient &apos;s blood pressure regimen was adjusted so that her pressure by the morning of 09/09 was 170/72 with subsequent values of 120/80 and 150/76 , adequate saturations on room air and it was decided to discharge the patient with medical management , hypertension initially and then a reconsideration of treatment of the valvular disease once the hypertension is under adequate control .the patient had an echocardiogram 09/09/94 showing moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy , preserved systolic function , estimated ejection fraction of 55% .aortic valve was mildly thickened with moderate insufficiency , 1+ mitral regurgitation , mild lae , normal rv size and function , 1+ tricuspid regurgitation , elevated flow velocity , pulmonic valve of 3 meters per second consistent with peak gradient of 36 .disposition :condition on discharge :the patient was discharged 09/09/94 in good condition .medications on discharge :at the time of discharge , the patient was on procardia xl 30 mg 1 po q.day , lisinopril 20 mg po q.day , labetalol 100 mg po tid , aspirin 325 mg po q.day and nitroglycerin sublingual q5 minutes prn chest pain .follow-up care :the patient is to follow-up with dr. fraction 09/25/94 .dictated by :tomedankell delta , m.d. nz86attending :jemalkyle j. fraction , m.d. fr1 wr790/5155batch :6268index no.
