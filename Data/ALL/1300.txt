m.d.gms goment nahpo servicedate of discharge:to be determined.chief complaint:increased dyspnea on exertion.history of present illness:this 62-year-old male with morbid obesity , hypertension , chronicrenal insufficiency , prior mi presents with increased lowerextremity edema and dyspnea on exertion over the last severalmonths. some of this has been attributed to volume overload andthe patient has had an increased creatinine from approximately inearly february of this year to 5.5 in september .  the patient hadpreviously refused dialysis , but agreed a few weeks ago to beginthe process of dialysis and was scheduled for a fistulaevaluation next week. however , in the past few days , his dyspneaon exertion has accelerated. whereas , he used to be able to walk40 to 50 feet without shortness of breath , he is now only able towalk 10 feet. therefore , he is presenting to the emergencydepartment. in the emergency department , he got his home cpap ,was noted on chest x-ray ( of poor quality ) to have a question ofa left lower lobe consolidation and therefore received one doseof ceftriaxone and azithromycin. his bnp was elevated to 1663( from 655 one year ago ) and his creatinine rose to 5.9 from 5.5in september and 4.1 in february .  therefore the patient was felt tohave also an element of volume overload and he was admitted tothe renal service for consideration of dialysis and volumeremoval.past medical history:1. hypertension.2. diabetes type ii.3. morbid obesity.4. sleep apnea.5. chronic hydronephrosis.6. fsgs ( focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ).7.

heard. there is no murmurs , gallops , or rubs. jvp cannot bedetermined. the patient has crackles at the right base. abdomenis markedly obese with significant lateral edema particularly onthe left side where his pannus tends to fall. there issignificant scrotal edema. the scrotum appears to be about 7inches in diameter. the patient has bilateral 3+ pitting legedema. he has 2+ dp pulses bilaterally. he has closed ulcers onhis abdomen which he states that have been there for severalyears and that he tends to pick at them daily to make them bleed.laboratory exam:sodium 145 , potassium

white blood cell count 6.2 , hematocrit33.3 , platelets 144 , 000 , inr 1.3 , bnp was 1663.chest x-ray showed left lower lobe opacification , but the patientwas not able to stand for a lateral chest x-ray.ekg showed first-degree av block with poor r wave progression anda question of q waves in 3 and avf.hospital course:1. renal: the patient was felt to be in volume overload. hischronic renal insufficiency was progressing likely for severalreasons including his chronic hydronephrosis. his focal segmentalglomerular sclerosis , diabetes , and hypertension. he wasinitially given large amounts of lasix but he failed to diuresesignificantly and his creatinine rose to approximately 7.0.therefore , a tunneled catheter was placed by vascular surgery andthe patient began urinalysis with the purpose of taking out ofvolume. approximately 20 liters of volume were taken off overseveral days of dialysis. the patient will continue hemodialysisthree times a week as an outpatient. in addition , he had venousultrasound mapping for likely placement of a permanent avfistula.2. pulmonary: the patient continued to wear his cpap for hissevere obstructive sleep apnea. his breathing improved somewhatduring his hospitalization but it was not possible to tell howwell he would do if he would attempt to walk again as he wassedentary and in bed for his entire hospitalization except foroccasionally sitting up on the side of the bed and moving to abed chair once or twice.3. infectious disease: there was not clear evidence of pneumoniacritically or on review of the chest x-ray and therefore thepatient was not specifically treated for pneumonia. however ,upon placement of a foley catheter , there was a significantamount of white blood cells in the urine and while the urineculture appeared not to be negative , the patient was treated witha 10-day course of levofloxacin ( renally adjusted ) for urinarytract infection. foley catheter was initially placed by urology.due to difficulties in the anatomy , it may get hard to place.once foley catheter was removed , the patient was able to urinateon his own.4. cardiovascular:a. rhythm: the patient was maintained on sotalol and abeta-blocker for his prior history of ventricular tachycardia.he did not have any episodes while inhouse on thishospitalization. the patient's electrophysiologist dr. marc c gouin suggested that given that the patient is on hemodialysis ,the sotalol should be reduced to 40 mg three times a week to begiven approximately two hours after dialysis. the plan was tomonitor the qt interval and discontinue sotalol as a qt intervalor if the qtc were greater than 500 msecs. a qtc was monitoredduring this hospitalization and never exceeded 500 msecs.therefore , the sotalol should be continued at this dose ondialysis days.b. ischemia: he is much ruled out for mi. he was maintained onaspirin , statin , and a beta-blocker.c. pump: the patient was volume overloaded on admission andimproved after significant volume reduction by hemodialysis. areview of the patient's prior cardiac echoes showed that in9/30 he had an ejection fraction of approximately 70%. in2/19 , his ejection fraction fell to about 45 to 50%. onrepeat echocardiogram during this admission , a repeatechocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of about 30 to 35%with a mildly dilated left ventricle , moderately reduced leftventricular function. akinesis in the entire apex of the basalseptum segment and the basal posterior segment of the heart andhypokinesis in the anterior wall , the anterior lateral wall , theinferior wall , and the mid anterior septum segment. there ismild mitral regurgitation. no tricuspid regurgitation and traceaortic regurgitation without any significant evidence of aorticstenosis.discharge medications:1. phoslo 1334 mg p.o. t.i.d. , instructions to give with meals.2. heparin 5000 units subcutaneous t.i.d.3. bactroban topical b.i.d. , please apply to legs.4.

receive hemodialysis three times a week ontuesdays , thursdays , and saturdays.the patient will follow up with dr. ezra ozuna as an outpatientwithin three or four weeks.the qtc intervals should be monitored every week while at rehabor at a regular doctor's appointment as an outpatient to ensurethat it is less than 500. if it is greater than 500 , then thefrequency of sotalol administration should be decreased in orderto maintain a qtc of less than 500 msecs.escription document: 1-5500630 emssten telcc: jacob a. lenton mdcardiac arrhythmia service , muin university hospitalquerwall
