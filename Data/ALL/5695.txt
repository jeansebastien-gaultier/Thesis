increasing rest pain in r leghpi:  the patient is a 53 year old woman with a past medical history of diabetes, htn, and pvd s/p l fem-pop bpg with in-situ vein 2063, r fem to ak pop bpg with gsv 2063, r fem-bk pop bpg with propatent graft 9/17/64, and multiple attempts at angiographic intervention who presents with worsening rest pain in the r leg x 1 month.  immediately following her 2nd r fem-pop bpg in 9/2064, she felt well and without significant le pain.  over the past month, however, the patient reports that she has had progressive pain in her r foot and leg, which wakes her up from sleep almost every night.  she can walk less than one block without disabling claudication which improves with rest.  she also has noticed discoloration of her r foot, along with numbness and paresthesias, which have been progressive over the same time period.  she denies all symptoms other than rle pain and claudication as described.  specifically, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, and fevers/chills.  she reports that her left leg is occasionally painful, although it has been tolerable in comparison to her r leg.  she has been taking aspirin and plavix regularly, but has not taken coumadin for 2 days (last dose 7/31/65).  she last underwent arterial lenis on 7/17/65, which demonstrated critical ischemia in her r leg and a thrombosed r fem-pop bpg (see below for official report).  she is admitted for elective revascularization of her r leg.  pmh:  dm iihtnpvdhyperlipidemiachronic pancreatitispsh: 9/20/64: angio/pta l proximal fem-pop bpg and l sfa9/17/64: r cfa endarterectomy;
