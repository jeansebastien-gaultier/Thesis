wife's limitedenglish. per wife, patient has been in the [name (ni) ] since [5-22] [1-18] cvainvolving the right extremities. his mental status has been poorat baseline and has increasingly worsened to a non-verbal stateapprox one month ago. beginning two nights ago, the patient wasnoted to have some respiratory distress, requiring oxygen andwas started on augmentin for a presumed pna. however, hisrespiratory status did not improve and was noted to have alow-grade temp of 100.9, rr 30, hr 140, bp 155/88, sao2 94% onsupplemental o2 (unknown amount), prompting the nh to send thepatient to the

ultrasound:the patient is status post right nephrectomy. the left kidneymeasures 13.4 cm. the calyces are mildly prominent throughoutthe left kidney, however, there is no frank evidence ofhydronephrosis. no stones or masses are identified. the bladderis catheterized and empty..video swallow:findings: video oropharyngeal fluoroscopic swallowing evaluationwas performed in conjunction with speech and swallow pathology.patient was administered various consistencies of bariumincluding thin, nectar, thick, and ground cookie. posterior oraltransit was moderately delayed. in addition, swallowinginitiation was severely impaired with significantly delayedswallowing initiation to large boluses. when swallow wasinitiated, there was some adequate epiglottic deflection, andlaryngeal valve closure. however, there was silent aspiration tothin liquids. the patient had difficulties following commandsduring the examination, and would not take cookie or straw.impression: severe swallow initiation delay with aspiration tothins. for further details, please consult the speech andswallow pathology note..ct head:clinical indication: metastatic renal cell carcinoma withsomnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage.there is a large hyperdense lesion involving the left frontallobe near the convexity measuring 4.2 x 4 cm and surrounded byvasogenic edema, with mass effect seen over the left lateralventricle. there is minimal midline shift to the right. theedema extends inferiorly into the left frontoparietal whitematter and the left temporal lobe. the ventricular system is notdilated. there is no intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage.the fourth ventricle remains in the midline. there isheterogeneous hyperdense lesion abutting the right frontalaspect of the calvarium along the midline. this could representvolume averaging. no lytic lesions are identified. chronicmucosal thickening is seen within the paranasal sinuses..impression: 4-cm hyperdense necrotic mass lesion involving theleft frontal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema andassociated with sulcal effacement and surrounding mass effect asnoted above. this is most likely metastatic in nature given thehistory of renal cell cancer. no intraparenchymal hemorrhage wasseen..ct chest:multidetector ct of the chest was performed without intravenousor oral contrast administration. images are presented fordisplay in the axial plane at both 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation..there is near complete opacification of the remaining portion ofthe left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lungat the apical portion. assessment of the central airwaysdemonstrates complete obstruction of the left main bronchus justbeyond its origin. the contents within the obstructed bronchusrange from fluid to soft tissue attenuation. superiorly, thereare some areas of consolidation and ground-glass superimposedupon underlying areas of emphysema, but beginning in the midportion of the left lung, opacified lung is relativelyhomogeneous without air bronchograms. an area of curvilinearcalcification is present in the lower left hemithoraxposteriorly and there are surgical clips present in theparaaortic and perihilar regions..the left lobe of the thyroid gland is markedly enlarged andheterogeneous. the superior portion of the enlarged lobe is notcompletely imaged on this scan, and it is difficult to excludeadjacent areas of lymphadenopathy in the left neck as well. theenlarged thyroid gland results in rightward displacement andcoronal narrowing of the trachea which is narrowed toapproximately 8 mm at the thoracic inlet level. there is bulkymediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with theright paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and aleft prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm. a bulky leftlower paratracheal lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.0 cm. the lefthilum is difficult to assess without intravenous contrast butthere is probable left hilar lymphadenopathy as well..there is left-sided pleural thickening contiguous with the areaof homogeneous opacification in the left lower lung region. thisis contiguous with an area of chest wall destruction involving alower left lateral rib which is partially destroyed by the mass.enlarged nodes are also present in the lower left paraaorticregion and in the left extrapleural space..within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there are bulkylymph node masses which are incompletely imaged on this study.these are in the region of the celiac axis anterior to theaorta, measuring up to approximately 5.5 and 6.4 cm in greatestdimension. a left anterior peridiaphragmatic enlarged node ispresent as well as left retroperitoneal node enlargement. theadrenal glands are incompletely imaged on this study. calcifiedgallstone is observed within the gallbladder. no definitelesions are seen within the liver but lack of intravenouscontrast limits assessment..as noted, the trachea is compressed and displaced by the thyroidmass. fluid level within the intrathoracic trachea is probablydue to retained secretions. within the right lung, there areseveral small pulmonary nodules present, some of which are wellcircumscribed, and others of which are more poorly defined. thelargest individual nodule is a poorly defined lateral segmentright middle lobe nodule measuring 10 mm on image 31 of series3. respiratory motion limits assessment of the right lower lobeand right middle lobe..skeletal structures reveal partial destruction of the leftseventh lateral rib as described above. post-thoracotomy changesare present just above this level. healed lower right anteriorrib fractures are noted without definite associated lyticlesions..finally, incidental note is made of a calcified granuloma in theperiphery of the right middle lobe.impression:1. complete obstruction left main bronchus. although possiblydue to retained secretions, obstructing endobronchial lesion islikely in this patient with history of renal cell carcinoma.correlative bronchoscopy would be helpful.2. postobstructive collapse/consolidation in left upper lobe(status post left lower lobectomy). associated soft tissue masswith dystrophic calcifications, contiguous or adjacent to chestwall mass with destruction of the left lateral seventh rib.3. bulky mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathyconsistent with metastatic disease. dedicated contrast-enhancedct torso could be considered to more completely characterize theextent of metastatic disease if warranted clinically.4. marked enlargement of left lobe of thyroid gland withdisplacement and compression of trachea. it is difficult toexclude adjacent lymphadenopathy in the left neck.5. left-sided pleural thickening and small amount of pleuralfluid.6. scattered nodules in the right lung, some of which are welldefined and likely reflect metastatic foci and others of whichare poorly defined and likely are related to the infection..brief hospital course:hospital course, by problem:#respiratory distress:  initially thought to be d/t aspirationpna.  was intially treated with broad spectum abx (vanc, ctx,flagyl).  blood and urine cx negative but sputum did grow mrsa.to sort out whether the patient simply had aspirationpnuemonitis vs pna, a ct scan of the chest was obtained.  thisshowed almost complete collapse of the remaining portion of hisleft lung from a l mainstem bronchus lesion, concerning formetastatic disease.  it also showed narrowing of the trachea toapprox 8 mm from an enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, which isstable in size according to his outside oncologists.  because ofrenal failure (see below), the patient was switched to linezolidto cover mrsa; ctx/flagyl were continued to cover for ?post-obstructive process. he will complete a today of a 10 daycourse of antitiotics to end on [9-15]..#acute renal failure:  during his hosptial course, his cr rosefrom a baseline of 0.3-0.4 to a peak of 2.2.  renal u/snegative.  urine indicies not c/w pre-renal state, urine eosneagtive.  renal team consulted; felt to be secondary to atn,most likely from vancomycin.  cr now starting to improve (2.0 onday of discharge)..#cerebral mets:  on ct scan, there was noted to me markedvasogenic edmema.  the patients dms was increased to 4 mg iv q 8hours and should be continued indefinatley as the patientappears to be more awake when on the higher dose.  they can bedecreased should the patient develop agitation..#onc issues/goals of care:  after the left mainstem lesion wasdiscovered, both interventional pulmonary team and radiationteam were consulted.  both felt that bronchoscopy and raditiontherapy would add little to his quality/quantity of life, givenhis extremely poor performance status and prognosis.  his wifewas in agreement that he should not receive any invasiveprocedures in the future.  she understood that should thepatient develop subsequent respiratory distress, she should notbe brought back to the hospital but should be given morphine andativan for comfort..#anemia:  high ferrtin c/w anemia of chronic disease.  stable..#fen:  the patient had speech/swallow evaluation which showedmoderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reducedbolus control and formation as well as a significant pharyngealswallow initiation delay with mild silentaspiration of thin liquids.   the speech/swallow teamrecommended nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, po medscrushed in purees, along with 1:1 assistance for meals, strictaspiration
