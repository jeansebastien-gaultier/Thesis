( 2 ) the right ventricle appears normal in size andsystolic function. ( 3 ) the aortic valve is trileaflet withoutevidence of dysfunction. ( 4 ) the mitral leaflets appear mildlythickened. there is light retrace mitral regurgitation. the leftatrium is enlarged. ( 5 ) a large heterogeneous multilobulated massis seen within the atrium. it appears to be attached by a stalk tothe interatrial septum. the mass measures approximately 7 x 3.5 cmand prolapses to the mitral valve and to the left ventricle. thedistal portion of this mass has more mobile element. a mild amountof inflow obstruction is noted , and there is also mild valvularincompetence. the appearance of the mass is most consistent withmyxoma , although other primary and secondary neoplasms are alsopossible. thrombus is seen much likely , but superimposed thrombusformation overlying the main mass is possible. ( 6 ) the tricuspidvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. there is trace tricuspidregurgitation with peak velocity of 2.7 m/sec predicting pulmonaryartery systolic pressures of 29 mmhg plus right atrial pressure.( 7 ) there is no evident pericardial effusion. ( 8 ) no prior studiesare available for comparison. ( 9 ) findings reviewed with clinicalteam. the patient also underwent a mri of the brain which revealedthe following: ( 1 ) left parietal infarct. ( 2 ) bilateral posteriorcommunicating arteries. otherwise , normal vasculature. thepatient was seen by the neurology service who recommended that thepatient did not proceed with his cardiac surgery at this time. hewill be discharged to home and be readmitted on 2/19/02 in theyear 2002 for his cardiac surgery. he has otherwise had anuneventful hospital course and will be discharged to home in stablecondition.allergies: the patient has no known drug allergies.medications: celexa 40 mg q.d. , atenolol 100 mg q.d. , allopurinol100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q.a.m. and lipitor 10 mgin the evening.physical examination: cardiac: regular rate and rhythm , with nomurmurs , rubs or heaves. respiratory:breath sounds clear bilaterally. neuro: alert and oriented withan expressive aphasia.discharge laboratory data: glucose 88 , bun 23 , creatinine 1.7 ,sodium 140 , potassium 4.6 , chloride102 , co2 27. wbc 8.12 , hemoglobin 9.0 , hematocrit 28.6 , platelets262. esr 87.discharge medications: enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg 1 p.o. q.d.atenolol 100 mg q.d. , lipitor 10 mg q.evening , allopurinol 100 mg q.d. , glyburide 5 mg q. morning , celexa40 mg q.d.mr. kowalcyk will be discharged to home in stable condition.dictated by: emory brackenridge , p.a.attending: hung r. mensing , m.d. oa44mm688/675566batch: 40841 index no. hthf3ve5f8 d: 11/18/02t: 7/18/02
