4/24/2098reason for consultation: progressive renal impairment.creat rose from 1.6 (nov 97) to 4.07 (may 98)history of present illness:this is a 69 year old male with a hx of cad s/p cabg 10/2097, who was referred on 6/03 from renal dr. turk, elvis at the central buffalo hospital to dr. judge at bhcc for rapidly progressive renal impairment.  he is an arteriopath with occluded aorta beneath the levels of renal arteries as revealed in recent mra. in the past an attempted femoral artery cannulation was proved unsuccessful due to above reason. subsequently he underwent two cardiac angiograms thro' left brachial and rt radial arterial route. his creatinine has risen from baseline of 1.6 (nov 97, post cabg) to 4.07 (may 98). he denies taking any nsaids. he thinks that he was started on altace post surgery, but was not sure about that fact.dr. turk did an duplex scan to assess his renal arteries which was suggestive of high grade stenosis of renal arteries on both sides. since ir doctors at centralbuffalo were not keen to do renal agniogram/angioplasty thro' radial artery route, dr.turk refered mr. ehlers to bhcc for consideration of renal angioplasty. he has also asked him to discontinue altace and to withold coumadin (indn: af) inview of potential angioplasty.he complains of claudication pains in both legs with left leg>rt leg. he experiences pain on exertion on left calf, thigh and buttock. he complains of long term pedal swelling which extends upto upper knee level. he is sob on moderate exertion and sleeps with 3 pillows. he also has some prostatic symptoms with poor urinary stream, frequency etc.past medical history:cad s/p cabg on 10/97paroxysmal afdm2htnhyperlipidemiapvd (occluded aorta)as (aortic bicapsid) bphmedications: nkdaamiodarone 200mg

severe bilateral renal artery stenosis for consideration of reno-vascular disease.plan:1. his mra of abdomen was reviewed with dr.quilici, bhcc ir department. aorta is fully occluded beneath the level of both kidneys. tight renal artery stenosis noted in both kidneys. both proximal and distal stenosis noted in the rt renal artery. both kidneys appeared normal in size 11.2 and 11.4 cm. dr.quilici is confident that renal angioplasty could be done relatively safely through radial artery approach.2. we have requested dr.xi, vascular surgeon to get his opinon on the need for surgical revascularisation of feet to save his legs from critical ischemia in the future. if so, whether he would benefit from surgical revascularisation of the kidneys. we are awaiting his expert opinion.3. patient realises that renal angiogram + angioplasty thro' radial artery carries its own risk. risks of cholesterol emboli, contrast nephropathy, arterial injury, risk of further deterioration of his kidney function leading to early initiation of dialysis are explained. however patient feels that it worth taking a choice to prevent the kidneys from worsening rapidly by attempted angiopalsty.4. we will obtain renal ultrasound to again measure his kidneys and to rule out any obstructive uropathy as the cause of renal dysfunction.5. if patient is going for ir renal angiogram/plasty, then he will need contrast prophylaxis.we will review him tomorrow with dr.xi's opinon._________________________________donnie youngman mb mrcp(eng)p43903renal staffi have seen and examined the patient twice today, and have reviewed his mr studies with radiologyin essence i agree with dr youngman's recs.patient has normal sized kidneys with insidious rise in cr without obvious identifiable remediable causes.he has severe aortic disease with occlusion of the aortia, mod severe bilateral claudication in ll.his renal arteries have ostial stenoses bilaterally.his options are:1) conservative approach, and likely esrd in the coming weeks2) radiological placements of bilateral stents via l brachial artery3) surgical bypass as a part of larger repair for ll claudicationwe are in discussions with radiology and surgery to come up with a final recommendation which we will d/w patient tomorrow.uriah judgemd phd
