issues:#alered mental status/hallucinations: given pt's history ofschizoaffective disorder and vascular dementia, initialpresentation was thought to be related to delirium vs.progressive dementia or primary psychiatric condition. initialwork-up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium wereunrevealing. urine analysis was unremarkable, chest xray showedno infiltrate, blood cultures showed no growth. a head ct wasnegative for an acute intracranial process. a head mri was alsoobtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes,and showedonly chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia.  an eeg wasobtained and was negative for epileptiform activity.  over thecourse of the work up described above, the pt slowly became morewithdrawn, which was different from her initial presentation inwhich she was talkative and quite labile with religious ideosityand frequent outburts of "hallelujah" and "praise [doctor last name ]."  shebegan to answer fewer questions, and began to appear somewhatparanoid.  psychiatry saw pt and recommended increasingantipsychotic dosage from short acting seroquel 250mg po qhs, tolong-acting seroquel 300mg po qhs and adding on haldol 1mg pobid.  this was done, and the next morning ([2165-8-16]) the patientseemed withdrawn and stuporous.  she was awake but notresponsive to questions verbally, answering only with mild headnodding. at this time, she was found to have a urinary tractinfection (see below), seroquel and haldol were discontinued andthe urinary tract infection was treated and her mental statusimproved the following day, returning to a level similar to atthe time of admission.on [2165-8-20], she appeared ill and was again withdrawn.  she wasfebrile and diaphoretic.  antibiotic coverage was broadened tovanc/cefepime/flagyl.  pt then developed recurrent svt to the220s, relieved with carotid massage.  she appeared rigid anddiaphoretic.  she was transferred to the icu for furthermanagement.  in the unit psychiatry was consulted and atypicalpresentation for neuroleptic malignant syndrome was considered.she was treated with 2mg cogentin and ativan with mildimprovement in her mental status.  she was transferred back tothe general medicine floor, where her mental status continued towax and wane but never returned to her initial level ofinteractiveness on admission.  she was responsive to somequestions, but refusing to answer others.  she did notparticipate in physical exam commands.  she remained stable atthis point for several days.  given the extensive negative workup for delirium, this was considered to be her new baseline andplacement was found for skilled nursing facility for dischargewith permission from her health care proxy.  at time ofdischarge, the patient remains aao x2 (unchanged from before);she is alert and talkative; still having delusions that herfamily is outside waiting for her; gets agitated about wantingto leave hospital and often refuses to sit or stay in bed.throughout hospitalization the patient was convinced that herhallucinations and delusions were real..# urinary tract infection: [2165-8-18] patient was febrile and urineanalysis suggested urinary tract infection. she was treated withceftriaxone. urine culture revealedgrew out presumptive strep bovis and e.coli grow out in herurine..# supraventricular tachycardia: patient has a remote hx svt, onmetoprolol for rate control. on [2165-8-19] she developed svt to the220s, which resolved spontaneously. over the course of thefollowing day, she had 4 more episodes of svt which responded tocarotid massage, she was never hypotensive. she was transferredto the micu for closer monitoring. cardiology was consulted whoidentified the rhythm as atrial tachycardia vs. avnrt.  thepatient has been stable on metoprolol 200 mg [hospital1 ].# hypoxia: on admission, patient was hypoxic with 2lnc o2requirement. there was no evidence of pulmomary edema orconsolidation. she was quickly weaned to room air. as part of awork up, an abg was performed which showed po2 of 58, thiscorrected to 92 with 2lnc. patient was maintained onsupplemental oxygen without improvement in mental status. givensignificant a-a gradient, and persistent tachycardia, cta wasperformed and showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. patienthas a 20 pack year history and likely has baseline hypoxia withsufficient compensation to maintain peripheral o2 saturation>92%.  at time of discharge, the patient no longer has an oxygenrequirement, and is satting mid to high 90s on ra.# ankle pain: initial laboratory analysis was remarkable for ckin the 800s and an elevated esr and crp. given her complaints ofleft leg and ankle pain, orthopedic and rheumatologic causeswere considered, as well as pe.  plain films of the left ankleand hip were negative for fracture, but did show an area ofpossible bone infarct in the distal tibia of unclearsignificance.  rheumatology was consulted who did not believethe presentation was consistent with sle, or gout. amyloidosiswas also considered however spep and upep, total protein andglobulin levels were unremarkable. statin-induced myopathy wasconsidered, and statin was held however ck had already begun totrend down when the statin was stopped, making statin inducedmyopathy unlikely.   a le doppler was negative for dvt. mri ofthe leg mri was done to evaluate for myositis, skeletalvasculitis or other inflammatory myopathy, and diabeticmyonecrosis. it was negative for any muscle inflammation ornecrosis, and showed only edema in the subcutaneous tissues,which had been noted on physical exam. within the first few daysof her admission, ankle pain and erythemia resolved, etiologyremains unclear..#cog-wheel rigidity/masked facies/resting tremor - on admissionto the micu, the patient developed acute presentation ofsymptoms concerning for extrapyrimidal symptoms related toantipsychotics.  patient had received prn doses of haldol, homeseroquel 250 mg.  however, all antipsychotics had been d/c'd 2days prior to symptom onset.  antipsychotics were held.  thepatient was given 1 mg cogentin x 2.  psych was consulted, whofelt that her symptoms were consistent with eps.  the patientwas started on ativan 1mg q6 hrs prn agitation.  upon transferback to the general medicine floor, her rigidity had improvedand she continued to be treated with prn ativan for agitation,though this made pt quite somnolent.  on [2165-8-25] she wasrestarted on seroquel 50mg po bid prn agitation in an effort toavoid sedation associated with benzos.  then as per psychrecommendation, the patient was restarted on low dose, 25 mg,seroquel [hospital1 ].  all other prn doses of seroquel and ativan wereheld.  the patient seems to be responding well to this regimen..# hypertension - pt had very difficult bp management while inhouse.  she was still measuring in sbp 170s on several occasionsdespite being on max dose of numerous bp meds, includingmetoprolol, losartan, furosemide, and clonidine patch.  while inhouse, hydralazine 10mg po tid was added to pt's regimen, andmetoprolol was further increased to 200mg po bid for managementof svt.  on this regimen, her pressures ranged from sbp 140s -150s, occassionally in the 170s.# hypercholesterol:  because of elevated cks (peaked at 819),the patient's simvastatin was discontinued.  ck normalized to 92by time of discharge.  she should have her ck rechecked asoutpatient and consider restarting simvastatin as outpatient.inactive issues:# cad - chronic.  clopidogrel was continued on admission butsimvastatin was discontinued shortly after admission secondaryto elevated ck levels.# restrictive lung disease: chronic.  patient was continued onalbuterol, ipratropium, tiotropium. symbicort was replaced withadvair during admission due to formulary.  pt is likelycompensated at a lower po2 secondary to her lung disease.  shewas repeatedly hypoxic during admission without complaints ofshortness of breath.  of note, pulse oximetry measured o2 satsin mid-90s on several occasions in which abg drawn at same timeshowed hypoxia, so pulse ox is not reliable measure  of oxygenstatus in this patient.# dm - held glyburide, gave ssi while in house# h/o candidal rash: miconazole powdertransitional issues:# schizoaffective disorder: the patient was admitted on seroquel250 qhs and because of the possibility of nms, the patient isbeing discharged on seroquel 50 mg [hospital1 ].  her lorazepam was heldthroughout hospital admission.# please check the patient's ck as an outpatient, as she hadelevated ck levels as
