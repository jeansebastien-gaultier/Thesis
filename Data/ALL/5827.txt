illness:  the patient is a 73-year-oldwoman who has a history of parastomal hernias and has hadthese hernias repaired times four or five. she now presentswith acute onset of abdominal distention, nausea andvomiting, as well as a mass in the parastomal region.past medical history:  etoh (one bottle of wine per day).hypertension.gastroesophageal reflux disease.hepatitis

stable. generally, she is in some distress.chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. cardiovascular isregular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.abdomen is soft, mildly distended and tender to palpation.tenderness is localized to the lower abdomen and more so inthe parastomal region. there is a large bulge around theostomy. stoma itself is fairly pink and healthy. extremitiesare warm and well perfused with minimal edema.hospital course:  the patient was admitted for repair of herincarcerated parastomal hernia. she was taken to theoperating room on [2121-11-3] for reduction, as well ascolostomy re-siting into the left upper quadrant. for detailsof this, please see the previously dictated operative note.postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated by whatwas thought to be an aspiration event on the evening ofpostoperative day number two. she had acute respiratorydistress, as well as change in mental status, which isdifferent from her baseline. she was maintained with lasixdiuresis and face mask for approximately 8-12 hours but thenwas subsequently intubated and transferred to the intensivecare unit for worsening respiratory status. she was initiallyonly intubated for about 24 hours and met all criteria forextubation. chest x-ray did confirm that she had bilateralupper zone infiltrates and the patient was empiricallytreated with a seven day course of vancomycin and levaquin.after the patient met her respiratory extubation criteria,she was extubated. she continued to do fairly well but hadchange in mental status, which could not be attributed toanything other than alcohol withdrawal. tsh, b-12 and folatelevels were checked, which were normal. ct scan of the headwas obtained on [2121-11-10], which did not show any evidenceof acute injury. there was some evidence of old lacunarinfarcts. mr of the head was completed on [2121-11-12], whichconfirmed the above. in addition, the neurology service wasconsulted for her change in mental status and they felt itwas best attributed also to her alcohol withdrawal, as wellas withdrawal from her serax. these were restarted per theirrecommendations and the patient gradually improved some ofher mental status.on [2121-11-10], the patient was re-intubated (postoperativeday number seven) for worsening respiratory status. she wasmaintained and ventilated during this time and had abronchoscopy performed on [2121-11-13], which proved to benegative for any significant pluggings or other bronchialdisease. the patient was extubated later that day on[2121-11-13], but then quickly failed her extubation trialwithin approximately six hours. she was emergently re-intubated and there was seen to be a fair amount of trachealand laryngeal edema at that time. the decision was then madeto give the patient a surgical airway and percutaneoustracheostomy was performed on [2121-11-14]. this was done inaccordance and consent with her son, who was the healthcareproxy during her change in mental status.ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative daynumber fourteen to a [hospital 4820] rehabilitation facility forventilatory weaning, as well as allowing clearance of hermental status. the neurology service had seen the patient onthe day of discharge and agreed with the above and tocontinue present management. the patient had a post-pyloricfeeding tube placed in interventional radiology on the day ofdischarge in order to decrease the risk of aspirationpneumonia. the patient was tolerating tube feeds adequate andhad good function with occasional tracheostomy mask trialsfrom the vent.disposition:  to [hospital 4820] rehabilitation facility.diet:  tube feedings:  impact with fiber (or otherimmunogenic tube feed formulation) at 75 cc/hr.discharge
