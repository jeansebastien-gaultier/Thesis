year-old male with a history of prior tobacco use , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , copd , gastritis , and tia who initially presented to braintree with a non-st elevation mi and guaiac positive stools , transferred to st. margaret's center for women & infants for cardiac catheterization with ptca to mid lad lesion complicated by hypotension and bradycardia requiring atropine , iv fluids and transient dopamine possibly secondary to vagal reaction , subsequently transferred to ccu for close monitoring , hemodynamically stable at the time of admission to the ccu .hospital course :1. cardiovascular :as summarized above , the patient had a non-st elevation mi with evidence of an 80 percent mid lad lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .he was initially continued on aspirin , plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ace inhibitor .at the time of discharge , his plavix was held due to guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .he had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .no focal wall motion abnormalities .he had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .in regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree av block which were stable throughout this admission .he will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .1. pulmonary :he had a history of copd for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and albuterol and atrovent mdi s p.r.n. at home .he is also on flovent mdi at home as well .he was continued on his mdi and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .1. renal :he has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .his ace inhibitor post mi was initially held due to his creatinine .however , this responded to iv fluids and his ace inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .he will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ace inhibitor .1. gastrointestinal :his stools were noted to be guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible gi bleed given continued guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .it was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient gi workup , and his pcp was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .his plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of gi bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .he was continued on his aspirin , however .discharge diagnosis :coronary artery disease , status post non-st elevation myocardial infarction with 80 percent mid lad lesion , now status post angioplasty .hypertension .chronic renal insufficiency .chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .guaiac  positive stools .anemia .discharge medications :1. lipitor 10 mg q.d.2. lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d.3. flovent 110 micrograms aerosol two puffs b.i.d.4. aspirin 325 mg q.d.5. combivent mdi p.r.n.6. toprol xl 100 mg q.d.disposition :at the time of discharge , the patient 's vital signs were stable and he was without complaints .discharge status :he will be discharged to home and was cleared by physical therapy .follow up :he has been scheduled for follow-up with dr. martha on 2015-03-25 at 11:00 a.m.it was discussed with him the need to schedule follow-up for colonoscopy with his pcp as well .he will call the cardiology division at addison gilbert hospital greenfield to schedule a follow-up with his cardiologist there within the next week .lucile minor etta , md12adadictated by : emily m. cassidy , m.d.medquist36d : 2015-07-29 17:03:53t : 2015-07-29 22:08:30job #: 81504signed electronically by : dr. brenda jm. espinosa on : maxine 2015-09-10 1:57 pm( end of report )
