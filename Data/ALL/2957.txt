and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with fournier's gangrene.  the patient was treated with iv abx and was taken urgently to the or, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  he was admitted to the sicu and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.in terms of his dm, he has type 2 diagnosed in october 2075.  at the time he was feeling "lousy," tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to payson hospital and fs was 376.  pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  he was being followed by dr. talley at the promptcare but stopped going there.  most recently treated with lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of glipizide 10 bid and metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled hba1c (see below).  he has microalbuminuria.  he is unable to give me a full history.in the sicu he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 u/hr.  he is being fed with glucerna continuous tf at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on nph 50 u q12h.   pmh:1. dm-22. htn3. mixed dyslipidemia4. depression5. obesity6. back pain7. fourier's gangrene as above8. hyponatremia on hctzall: nkdameds pta:1. asa 81 daily2. atenolol 100 qam, 50 qpm3. celexa 60 daily4. fenofibrate 145 daily5. glipizide 10 bid6. klonopin 1 prn7. lantus insulin 50 units bedtime8. lipitor 80 daily9. lisinopril 40 daily10. losartan 25 daily11. metformin 1000 bidcurrent meds: 1. insulin gtt 4-11 u/hr2. lopressor 75 qid3. seroquel 25 bid4. nexium 40 daily5. celexa 60 daily6. vancomycin 2g iv q12h7. cefepime 2g iv q12h8. ativan 0.5 iv q12h9. dilaudid 0.25 iv q4h10. levofloxacin 750 mg iv daily11. lovenox 30 mg bid12. nph 50 units q12h13. iron sulfate 300 tidhab:	tobacco: denies	etoh: occasional  	rd: deniessh: works as a teacher of persons with disabilities.fh: father had an mi in his 40's.pe:vs:  t 100.2	  p 95 	bp 127/75	rr 18 	o2 99% 2l nc  wt 341 lbs ptagen:  alert, calm, comfortable, nad;
