results:[2104-5-19] ct head:impression: there are two rim-enhancing lesions peripherallylocated within the right frontal lobe, as described above, withassociated vasogenic edema and mass effect. the inferior lesiondemonstrates a punctate focus of hemorrhage. while the superiorlesion does abut the dura, it lacks characteristic dural tail,making meningioma a less likely consideration.  moreover, themore inferior lesion does appear intra-axial on coronal andsagittal reformatted images. differential diagnosisincludes metastatic disease versus abscess.[2104-5-19] mri brain w/ & w/o:1. two
