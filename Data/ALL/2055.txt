complaint:infected ppmmajor surgical or invasive procedure:lead and pacemaker extractiontemporary pacerpacer insertion left chesthistory of present illness:mr [known lastname ] is an 82-yo man with complete heart block s/p dualchamber [company ] pacemaker [10/2101] with rv lead revision [2-/2112]and recent device infection in [1-/2113], hypertension,dyslipidemia, gerd, and bph, who presented today with continueddevice infection for lead and device extraction. the procedurewas prolonged due to significant fibrosis of the pacer leads,and he was noted to have purulent material that was extractedand sent to the microbiology lab for analysis. given his historyof complete heart block and hypotension with his ventricularescape rhythm, a temporary screw-in external pacemaker wasplaced in the right ij. intra-operative tee was unremarkable,but he did require neosynephrine in the or for hypotension thatwas thought to be due to the prolonged anesthesia. given thesignificant infection, the wound was left open, to close bysecondary intention, with plan to treat with iv antibiotics overthe weekend and re-implant a pacemaker next week..with regards to the recent device infection in [2113-1-12],this was initially treated with iv vancomycin, but that wasdiscontinued due to development of fever and rash. he wasinstead treated with a full course of iv linezolid. the site wasnoted to have significantly improved, and he was seen in [hospital ]clinic at the end of [month (only) 404] at which point the site wasconsidered to be healed. per the patient, the site was stablefor over 3 months, but he then developed a new area of erythemaover the left lateral aspect of the pocket, with blistering. hewas seen for this complaint in [hospital ] clinic on [2113-6-7]. he deniesany fevers or chills but has been experiencing pain at thepacemaker site with his usual activity. his wbc was 5.1 with anormal differential on [2113-6-12], and he was admitted today forlead and device extraction for continued infection versus newpocket site infection..on arrival to the ccu, the patient was hypotensive with sbp inthe 60s. he received a 200cc ns ivf bolus with improvement tothe 90s. he complains of left-sided chest pain as well as painand tingling in his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right.there is no weakness or numbness of the hands. the pains areintermittent. ecg showed v-pacing at 60 bpm. stat tte showed noobvious effusion or depressed ventricular function, and stat cxrwas also unremarkable. his external pacemaker rate was increasedfrom 60 to 80 bpm. iv linezolid was started for possiblesepticemia. he did not require any further ivf or vasopressorsupport..on review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,tia, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at thetime of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, blackstools or red stools. all of the other review of systems werenegative..cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea onexertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,palpitations, syncope or presyncope.past medical history:1. cardiac risk factors: +diabetes, +dyslipidemia,

he was seen for this complaint in [hospital ]clinic on [2113-6-7]. he denies any fevers or chills but has beenexperiencing pain at the pacemaker site with his usual activity.his wbc was 5.1 with a normal differential on [2113-6-12], and he wasadmitted on [6-15] for lead and device extraction. on arrival tothe ccu, the patient was hypotensive with sbp in the 60s. hereceived a 200cc ns ivf bolus with improvement to the 90s. hecomplained of left-sided chest pain as well as pain and tinglingin his fingers bilaterally, left worse than right. there is noweakness or numbness of the hands. the pains are intermittent.ecg showed v-pacing at 60 bpm. stat tte showed no obviouseffusion or depressed ventricular function, cxr was alsounremarkable. his external pacemaker rate was increased from 60to 80 bpm. he was started on iv linezolid. he did not requireany further ivf or vasopressor support.  the patient underwentpacer and lead extraction on [2113-6-15] without complication. atemporary pacer was also placed after removal.  the patientremained stable and blood cx were ngtd.  he was seen by id whorecommended 2 weeks of linezolid from pacer extraction [2113-6-15].the patient had a new pacemaker placed on [2113-6-19] withoutcomplication.  cxr showed no ptx and leads in proper position.his wound culture eventually grew coag-neg staph.  the patientwill have both id and ep follow-up with weekly labs.   thepatient remained afebrile and pacemaker was working properly.# complete heart block (rhythm) - see above for management ofpacemaker. the patient had his lead and pacer extracted on[2113-6-15]. a temporary external pacemaker in right ij was placed.he was monitored on tele. a new pacemaker was placed on [2113-6-19]without complication.# coronaries - the patient has no known cad or findings of cadon ecg.  he remained chest pain free. he was continued on homeasa..# pump - the patient had an intra-op ef 35-40% with moderateglobal lv hypokinesis. he remained clinically euvolemic.# hypertension - the patient's anti-hypertensives were intiallyheld secondary to his hypotension.  once his pressures hadstabilzed he was restarted on lisinopril 10mg and homemetoprolol succinate 12.5mg at the time of discharge.# dyslipidemia - stable, continued home statin.# diabetes - stable, continued home actos and iss. he was alsocontinued on a diabetic diet.# gerd - stable, continued home h2b# bph - his flomax was initally held secondary to hypotension,but restarted once stable.medications on admission:lisinopril 20mg dailylovastatin 20mg dailymetoprolol succinate 12.5mg dailyactos 15mg dailyzantac 150mg daily prnflomax 0.4mg dailyaspirin 325 mg dailyvitamin c 500mg dailyvitamin b12 500mcg dailyglucosamine-chondroitin 500mg-400mg dailyloratadine 10mg qhsmultivitamin dailyaleve 220mg daily prnvitamin e 400unit dailydischarge medications:1. aspirin 325 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily (daily).2. tylenol 325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets po four times a day asneeded for pain.3. lovastatin 20 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily ().4. pioglitazone 15 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).5. ranitidine hcl 150 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily) as needed for indigestion.6. metoprolol succinate 25 mg tablet sustained release 24 hrsig: 0.5 tablet sustained release 24 hr po once a day.7. ascorbic acid 500 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).8. vitamin e 400 unit tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a day.9. cyanocobalamin 500 mcg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).10. loratadine 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po at bedtime.11. multivitamin     tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).12. tamsulosin 0.4 mg capsule, sust. release 24 hr sig: one (1)capsule, sust. release 24 hr po hs (at bedtime).13. lisinopril 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).14. outpatient lab workplease draw cbc on [2113-6-27] when pt comes to see dr.
