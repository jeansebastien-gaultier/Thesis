no acute intracranial hemorrhage or masseffect. 2. although there is no ct evidence of largeintracranial mass, mri with gadolinium is superior in evaluationof such lesions and can be considered if not contraindicated.[11-15] leni- no evidence of right lower extremity deep venousthrombosis.[11-15] ekg: st at 108 bpm, no other acute changes[11-18] trans thoracic echo- the left atrium is normal in size. noatrial septal defect is seen by 2d or color doppler. theestimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmhg. left ventricularwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolicfunction are normal (lvef >55%). there is no ventricular septaldefect. right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion arenormal. the aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.the aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. there is novalvular aortic stenosis. the increased transaortic velocity islikely related to high cardiac output. mild (1+) aorticregurgitation is seen. the mitral valve leaflets are mildlythickened. there is no mitral valve prolapse. trivial mitralregurgitation is seen. the tricuspid valve leaflets are mildlythickened. the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure isnormal. there is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.[11-25] renal u/s: 1. no evidence of hydronephrosis, withresolution of the mild hydronephrosis seen on ct [2137-11-15]. 2.nonvisualization of left renal interpolar region indeterminatelesion seen on ct scan [2137-11-15], due to limited visualization.for further evaluation,if clinically relevant, an mr could beperformed.[12-3] cxr: the heart size remains normal and no typicalconfigurational abnormalities is seen. thoracic aorta, stableand within normal limits. position of previously described leftsubclavian approach advanced central venous catheter remainsunchanged terminating overlying the svc at the level of thecarina.  no pneumothorax is seen. in comparison with the nextpreceding portable examination, the findings have cleared upmarkedly. in particular the basal bilateral densities stronglysuggestive of bilateral pleural effusions as seen on [2137-11-21], have now practically cleared completely, as both lateraland posterior pleural sinuses are free with the patient inupright position. also, the parenchymal densities haveregressed; however, significant residuals remain on both sides.these consist of lateral located hazy parenchymal densitiesclose to the pleural space at the level of the third and fourthrib. on the left side these parenchymal densities are also inperipheral location but somewhat higher up and overlying thesecond and third ribs including the corresponding interspace. incomparison with the preceding single view examination, it ispossible that these parenchymal densities have progressedslightly and thus, further followup chest examinations in thispatient with history of lymphoma is recommended.[12-4] ct chest: 1. widespread peripheral consolidations whichare new or increasing. these are not entirely specific, but thestriking peripheral character of consolidations is verysuggestive of an inflammator etiology such as eosinophilicpneumonia or organizing pneumonia, either of which could beassociated with a drug reaction. the appearance would be muchless typical for an infectious etiology or progression oflymphoma, which has apparently responded overall very well totreatment.2. new mild extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of uncertainsignificance. correlation with liver function tests isrecommended. if the apppearance may be clinically significantbased on laboratory data or clinical presentation, then mrcpcould be considered or follow-up ct or ultrasound. extrinsiccompression by lymphadenopathy that is not imaged on this studyis a possible, though somewhat unusual, possibility.[12-4] ct head: 1. no evidence of intracranial metastaticdisease. mr (if feasible) would be more sensitive than ct fordetection of metastatic lesions. 2. no acute intracranialprocess.[12-9] cxr: heart size is normal. mediastinal position, contour,and width are unremarkable and stable. the abnormalitiesdemonstrated on prior chestradiograph and chest ct appears to be grossly unchanged exceptfor may beminimal progression at the level of the left lower lobe andright uppersuperficial area as well as interval development of minimalamount of pleural effusion on the right. the finding continuesto be nonspecific with the differential diagnosis being broadincluding eosinophilic pneumonia, cryptogenic organizingpneumonia, drug reaction, and less likely
