internal carotid occlusion .associated diagnoses :coronary artery disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , status post right above-knee amputation and status post left great toe amputation .principal procedure :left carotid endarterectomy 09/22/93 .history of present illness :this 75 year old hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease , status post a middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident was admitted for left carotid endarterectomy .his history of present illness began with a worsening left toe ulcer in 06/93 resulting in a left great toe amputation .approximately two days following discharge , his family members noted that his behavior had changed , including personality changes , confusion and self-neglecton 08/07/93 he was admitted to fairm of ijordcompmac hospital where an magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a 4 centimeter infarct in the left frontoparietal and temporal areas without evidence of bleeding .he was noted to have calcified vertebral artery .his infarct was felt to be consistent with a superior middle cerebral infarct .at that time holter monitor showed no abnormalities .an echocardiogram was reportedly normal and an mri angiogram documented a 95% occlusion of his left coronary artery .he was sent home on coumadin for follow up with vascular surgery for carotid endarterectomy and presented on 09/18/93 for his procedure .past medical history :insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for five years and peripheral vascular disease , status post a right above knee amputation in 1987 for gangrene and status post his left great toe amputation in 06/93 .medications on admission :included coumadin 2.5 mg. g with 5 mg. d , lasix 40 mg. q.day and nph insulin 55 units sub-cu. qam .substance history :notable for remote alcohol abuse .physical examination :he was reportedly well-appearing with a temperature of 99.7 , blood pressure of 140/86 , heart rate of 92 and respiratory rate of 20 .heent was normocephalic , atraumatic with a supple neck and no lymphadenopathy .lungs demonstrated bilateral bibasilar crackles .cardiac exam :regular rate and rhythm , s1 , s2 , and a systolic flow murmur was noted .his abdomen was reportedly soft , nontender with normoactive bowel sounds .extremities showed no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .pulses were markedly diminished bilaterally .radially the left carotid pulse was felt to be stronger than the right and the left dorsalis pedis pulse was 1+ .bilateral carotid bruits were noted as well .neurologic exam was notable for disorientation to time , increased tone in his left upper extremity and slight right facial droop and a markedly decreased gag on the right side .the deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetric .laboratory data :sodium of 138 , potassium of 4.4 , chloride of 101 , bicarbonate 30.9 , bun of 16 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose of 283 , hematocrit of 41.5 , white blood count of 6.7 with 50% polys , 29% lymphs .platelet count of 224,000 , prothrombin time of 12.2 , partial thromboplastin time of 30.9 .his admission electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with pr interval of .14 , qrs of .08 with st-segment and t-wave abnormalities consistent with apical lateral subendocardial ischemia relative to the august 7 , 1993 electrocardiogram .hospital course :mr. iron was admitted to the ossontonville milt ywestmeadtl marlenc hospital where he underwent preoperative evaluation .a medical consultation was obtained for his abnormal electrocardiogram with recommendation for a persantine thallium study .on 09/21/93 he underwent a persantine thallium study with no complaints of chest pain .his heart rate went from 70 to 84 , 63% maximal predicted heart rate .blood pressure was unchanged .after persantine infusion , electrocardiogram showed 1 to 2 millimeter downsloping st-depressions , v4 through v6 , 0.5 to 1 millimeter st-depressions in 1 , 2 and avf .the changes returned to baseline after intravenous aminophylline was administered .the test was felt to be positive for ischemia and thallium images demonstrated a small amount of inferoapical ischemia as well as left ventricular dilatation upon exercise and normal pulmonary uptake .on 09/22/93 he underwent an uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was treated intraoperatively with nitroglycerin .on 09/23 he was noted to have asymptomatic st-depressions of 1 to 2 millimeters in leads 2 , 3 , f , v2 through v6 .he ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial cpk 's on nitro paste , oxygen , metoprolol and aspirin .the st-depressions largely resolved .on 09/26/93 he was transferred to the medical service for further evaluation of his cardiovascular status .a cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for maximization of medical regimen and deferring cardiac catheterization at that time .his course was also remarkable for adjustments in his insulin regimen with difficult control of his glucose and postoperative anemia treated with iron sulfate .on 09/29/93 he remained hemodynamically stable with his left carotid endarterectomy site healing well .he was discharged home to follow up with dr. tiffill sapnins of dingclearf alllirefaith memorial hospital and dr. dwainco rallsversgach of cardiology .he was to follow up as well in the h health network for postoperative care .medications on discharge :ecotrin 1 po q.day , isordil 20 mg. po tid , lopressor 50 mg. po bid , nph insulin 55 units subcutaneously q.am and iron sulfate 325 mg. po bid .margna iron , m.d.tr :kb /
