pneumonia..# sepsis/pneumonia: patient was admitted to the icu onnon-rebreather and acutely decompensated overnight.  she hadhypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation which wasagreeable to her neice and hcp, [name (ni) ] [name (ni) ].  she becamepressor dependent while intubated for pressures in the 60s/30sand went in to a-fib with rvr (see below).  she was started onvancomycin and zosyn on [2105-12-7] for hap.  sputum cx andbronchoscopy x2 failed to reveal infectious bacteria, but shewas kept on these antibiotics given her respiratory status andpressor dependence.  after much discussion with hcp it wasdecided that she would not want trachiotomy or peg tube andwould prefer extubation, even if this leads to her demise.  thedecision has been made to make pt??????s goals of care comfortoriented-  no further interventions, no heroic measures.  sheeventually was weaned off pressors on [2105-12-18] and was extubated. she finished a 14 day course of vanc and zosyn on [2105-12-20].since then has been afebrile. her code status was changed backto full code.# acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: resolved with 91-92%/ra.as above, patient was intubated from [2105-12-8] to [2105-12-18].  shecontinues to have incr plugging which has been treated withaggressive suctioning and chest pt.  was on vanc/zosyn whichended on [2105-12-20].  she does continue to have a large leftpleural effusion, and right effusion, without clear infectiousetiology. this is most likely from chf. it was unlikely thatdoing thoracentesis would help her with improved oxygenation andthat the fluid would most likely reaccumulate from chf. alsogiven her kyphotic posture, she would unlikely go over hercurrent oxygen saturation level on room air..# atrial fibrillation with rvr: patient converted to a-fib withrvr during her hypoxic respiratory failure.  her rate wasinitially controlled with iv diltiazem.  she was started onamiodarone gtt and converted to sinus on [2105-12-9].  she wastransitioned to po amiodarone for taper and will be tapered from400mg [hospital1 ] to 400mg qday on [2105-12-23] which should last for 1week, then be reduced to 200mg daily..# acute encephalopathy:  she developed change in mental statusas a result of her prolonged icu stay, and gradually clearedpost extubation..# diastolic chf, acute:  she developed bilateral pleuraleffusions and interstitial edema with fluid resuscitation.  shehad an echo that showed a preserved ef.  attempts were made atdiuresis but were limited by her low intravascular volume..# hypernatremia: sodium went up to almost 148 after diuresis.diuresis was then held and she was given back fluid. she can bediuresed at rehab prn. also her sodium will need to be checkedin [3-15] days to monitor..# diarrhea:  she developed diarrhea after antibiotic treatmentwas completed.  she had two negative cdiffs.  she was treatedempirically with flagyl, which was discontinued after the c diffwas negative..# goals of care:  this was discussed repeatedly with her hcp,who originally made her dnr/dni when she was terminallyextubated.  however, since she survived extubation, they choseto again make her full code.  this should continue to beaddressed.medications on admission:memantine 10 mg po qam / 5 mg qpmmiralaxsertraline 100 mg qdaysimvastatin 80 mg qhsacetaminophen prnalprazolam 0.25 mg po bidsimethicone 1 tab
