admission date :2015-09-20discharge date :2015-09-30service :neurologyhistory of present illness :ms. swanson is a 53 yo woman with pmh significant for seizure disorder , brain injury , and ? atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking .history is obtained from her sister , william from lawrence general hospital , and from her primary neurologist , dr. brian .she lives in an assisted living , and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonic-clonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting 90 minutes .ems gave her valium 5 mg pr at the facility and brought her to barnstable county hospital .she persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium 10 mg and ativan 1 mg , as well as loaded with dilantin 1000 mg .she was transferred to the providence behavioral health hospital cmed .here she was given an additional valium 5 mg x 2 and ativan 1 mg x 3 for persistent twitching in her face and right hand .since the ativan , her facial twitching has apparently improved , but she continues to have hand twitches .she also had an eeg , which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read .apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder , possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury ( though per dr. paula , records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury ) and has been managed on dilantin and keppra .since she has seen dr. ollie , she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure , as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonic-clonic activity .her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control .he tried adding lamictal , but this caused a rash .at the time of her last visit ( 2015-03-18 ) dr. bradley had discussed the addition of a third castelluccio , possibly zonegran ( less likely topamax ), to the dilantin 200 mg bid and keppra 1500 mg bid .her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that .however , she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit , with 15.4 in 05 - 23.5 in theresa , and 3.09 - 18 .her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to 200 mg qam and 100 mg qpm in theresa , and a review of her union hospital - north shore medical center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a non-trough level of 15.9 .according to her sister , the patient has no short-term memory .she has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit .the patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister .ms. swanson also carries a diagnosis of " atypical ms ", which she brought with her to dr. billie .according to dr. nicole , she has had stable deficits for many years without any flare-like episodes .she had an mri in 2014 that showed multiple plaque-like lesions , but these were entirely stable since 2010 .she is not undergoing any treatment .reportedly she has been evaluated at shriner's hospital for crippled children , healthsouth braintree rehab hospital , and possibly st. elizabeth's medical center of boston .she has not had an lp as far as dr. ginger knows .brief hospital course :53 yo woman with h/o seizure disorder , demyelinating disease , and brain injury , presents with prolonged seizure , now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face .this is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere , most likely the motor strip .in the past , her seizures were on the left side , which implies that she now has a new focus .it is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease , but per report this has not been very active .other possibilities include infection , including her uti .it is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of 200 mg / 100 mg .her seizure management is difficult , given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech .discussed with dr. joaquin the addition of an alternate castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future , and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran .cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions .topamax is another possibility , but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits .she was started on zonegran at 50 mg daily with plans to increase by 50 mg every other week to a goal dose of 200 mg / day ; she was on 100 mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on 10-12 and again on 10-26 .she was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed .ativan was used for breakthrough seizures ( facial twitching ).mri/mra showed new temporal lesions , but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures .she will need to have a repeat mri in several months for further evaluation .lp was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ( ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping ).oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough csf per the laboratory .she will need repeated dilantin troughs with one time dose when trough is subtherapeutic .pending tests :angiotensin 1 converting enzymeebv-pcrherpes simplex virus pcrernest virus ( jcv ) dna pcrlyme , total eia with reflex to csf ratiovaricella dna ( pcr )vdrl2. atypical ms : discussed with her outpt neurologist ( dr. ford in boston medical center ); no current role for ms medications .mri was performed and showed new lesions vs sz effects in the left temporal lobe .she also had a new lesion on her last mri in the centrum semiovale .lp was done to evaluate for malignancy , and no malignant cells were seen .immunotyping was negative as well ( per verbal report ).unfortunately , oligoclonal bands could not be sent from the csf ( lab sent csf for other studies and there was not enough left over for ocb s).this was relayed to the family ( kirk ).given that she does have new lesions on mri , if ocb s were sent this would have weighed in in her dx of ms , and it's possible she could benefit from ms therapy .this was relayed to the family , and they will readdress this with dr. ford ( ms hoyos ).the family is confident in any decision dr. ford would make re : therapy for her ms .3. fevers on admission : pt w/ positive u/a , treated with bactrim x 3 days with defervescence .4. depression : continue escitalopram ; assess need to change medication as an outpatient .5. fen : ngt was placed given her altered mental status , and she has been unable to pass a swallow evaluation , but has improved .this should be repeated in several days as her mental status continues to clear .commun : sister andrew is hcp .
