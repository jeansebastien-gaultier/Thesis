failure .associated diagnosis :aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .allergies :sulfonamides .principal procedure :cardiac catheterization - 4/1/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram 3/27/93 .doctors discharge orders :lasix 40 mg qd ; digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; isordil 10 mg tid .history of present illness :mr. breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in march , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .he had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .an intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .he also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and atenolol .he returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .physical examination :weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .the venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .the carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .there was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .the right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .there was a grade i-ii murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious s3 .the liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .his chest x-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .the electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree av block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific st-t wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to june , 1992 .later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .the left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .the aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .there was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .the left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .there was also doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .a persantine thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .laboratory data :potassium 4.4 , bun and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , ck 162 , with 11.1 mb for a relative index of 6.9% .this was of uncertain significance .the hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare enterococcus .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the medical service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous furosemide .over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .at the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the pa pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .there was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .there was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .the anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .the aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .a dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .a large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .the posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .the left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .the saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .the saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .the saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .these findings were reviewed with dr. patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in mr. breun &apos;s management .his advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .it is very unlikely that we will offer mr. breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .he seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .he is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .we will see how far we can get with medical therapy although mr. wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .ethelan kotefyfechird , m.d.tr :go / bmotdd :4/4/93td :04/06/93cc :
