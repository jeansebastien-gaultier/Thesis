of 80 , blood pressure 146/76 , and respiratory rate of16. o2 saturation of 96% on room air. heent: she had moistmucous membranes. her oropharynx was clear. she had a leftpupil which was enlarged and nonreactive secondary to that beinga surgical eye. right eye was reactive. she had nolymphadenopathy. lungs: left side was clear toauscultation. the right side had decreased breath sounds at thebase , few crackles at the right base. cardiovascularexamination: she had irregularly irregular rhythm. she had anormal s1 , s2 , did not have any murmurs , rubs , or gallops and wasfound to have a flat jvp on admission. abdominal examination:she had positive bowel sounds , she was soft , nontender ,nondistended. she did not have any hepatomegaly. extremities:she was warm and well perfused. distal pulses were not palpable.she did have trace edema , left greater than right which waschronic. she was alert and oriented x3.hospital course by problem:pulmonary/oncology: the patient was admitted in stable conditionand was requiring 2 liters of oxygen to keep her saturations inthe mid 90s. she had a chest x-ray which showed a right pleuraleffusion. review of previous imaging done on 9/15/2006demonstrated an area of consolidation in the right lower lobe ,which was surrounded by a right pleural effusion of moderatesize. the patient also had a pet scan in early november , whichshowed that the consolidation lit up extensively. review ofthese studies prompted consideration of possible pneumonia versusa bronchioalveolar carcinoma spread. pulmonary was consulted andthey suggested starting the patient on antibiotics for possiblepostobstructive pneumonia. she was started on levofloxacin ,vancomycin , and flagyl on 1/4/2006. she received 7 days ofthese antibiotics while in hospital. on day 4 of herhospitalization , a thoracentesis was performed for bothdiagnostic and therapeutic reasons. the pleural fluiddemonstrated a transudative picture. gram stain was negative.cultures did not grow anything. cytology , preliminary read wasnegative. she had 50 white blood cells and 2000 red blood cellsapproximately 800 ml were removed and the patient felt much lessshort of breath following the thoracentesis requiring much lessoxygen. a followup ct scan was obtained , which showed continuedinfiltrate in the right lower lobe with decreased right pleuraleffusion , no pneumothorax was observed. radiology felt that herconsolidation was most likely consistent with pneumonia and thatit was not postobstructive given that the bronchioles were in factquite patent and thus it was decided that the patient wouldcontinue a 14-day course of levofloxacin with followup withpulmonary to consider whether or not a bronchoscopy would beindicated for further workup of this patient's infiltrate withfollowup imaging to occur as well.cardiovascularly , for this patient , ischemia wise , the patientdid have 2 episodes of chest pain prior to admission. she didnot have any ekg changes. two sets of cardiac markers wereobtained which were both negative , thus assumed that she did nothave ischemic event that occurred. she was continued on heraspirin and pravastatin while inhouse. pump wise , the patienthas a diagnosis of chf with an ef of 30%. she presentedapproximately 2 kg above her dry weight. she was continued onher home dose of torsemide 40

returned to herdry weight and on the day of discharge , has a weight of 72.6 kg ,had been admitted with a dry weight of 74.9 kg. rhythm wise , thepatient has a history of atrial fibrillation. she was ratecontrolled with her metoprolol 37.5 mg daily. her coumadin wascontinued except for brief period during which it was held priorto the tap of this. coumadin was restarted prior to discharge.endocrine wise , this patient's fingersticks were well controlled.she was put on a course of lantus and novolog q.a.c. slidingscale as needed. fingersticks were maintained within a normalrange. her levoxyl was 100 mcg daily , was continued and herallopurinol 100 mg daily was continued for her history of gout.on discharge , she is being put back on her glipizide for thediabetes.fluid , electrolytes , and nutrition. the patient came inhyperkalemic. she was given kayexalate 30 mg x1 in the emergencyroom to which she responded and had a normal potassium throughouther hospital stay.renal. for this , the patient with her diuresis she did and withthe addition of the hydralazine , she did have her creatinine dropfrom 2.2 down to 1.7 during her hospital admission on the day ofdischarge , it was 1.9 , which is within her baseline for herchronic renal insufficiency.hematology wise , the patient had a stable hematocrit in the low30s. she was continued on her iron 325 twice a day for her irondeficiency anemia. leni's also performed and showed no evidence of dvt.on the day of discharge , notable findings on physical exam , shewas afebrile. heart rate
