of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .mri was recommended , and on 11/12 she underwent an mri which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the p2 segment of the right pca .after her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .throughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .she had no further neurologic symptoms .post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .she was seen in consultation by the renal service who followed along closely .eventually she had renal mra which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .in order to evaluate this , on 10/21 she underwent renal mra which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .she underwent abdominal ct which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .there was no evidence of gi bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .she was seen in consultation by the eps service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a qrs duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an ef of 46% .this echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .she was seen in consultation by pt , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .she was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .she however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .she was maintained on fragmin and will be considered for lowdose coumadin once the plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .condition on discharge :she is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .ata single , n.p.dictating for :electronically signedshondmagshao andli single , m.d.11/23/2002 10:07_____________________________ shondmagshao andli single , m.d.tr :tmdd :11/22/2002td :11/22/2002 8:28 a 769260cc :asha erelleden lalanie vengloan , m.d. shondmagshao andli single , m.d.
