fever and tachycardiasince 10/5/06 .  it is very difficult to elicit a clear story. thepatient has had cough productive of variably colored sputum ( yellowto green to orange , without hemoptysis ) but it seems she mayhave had a similar cough for months. similarly , she notes dysuriaand increased frequency which it seems has also been present forweeks to months. she is not short of breath and has no headache ,chest pain , hemoptysis , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ,numbness , le swelling , le pain , rash. she does have some bumps onher abdominal wall which are painful-it sounds like these are adirect result of the enoxaprin she had been getting for a pe inmarch of this year.the zh er doctor spoke with senz at the nursing home. she saidthat the patient had an x-ray two days ago which revealed pneumonia ,and her referral states that the pneumonia was in the left upperlobe and left lower lobe; the patient was started on levaquin 500 mgp.o at that time. in the fmc emergency room , the patient was hydratedwith 3 liters of normal saline and her pulse still remains in the130s. she was given levofloxacin 500 mg iv. the er physician wasworried about a pulmonary embolus , did not do a chest ct herebecause of her elevated creatinine of 1.9. she was transferred tothe chamvine tionbradvar general hospital for an mra to rule out pe. in er here , ij central lineplaced ( cvp~20 ) and patient given 1l ns. blood pressure systolicinitially 120s but decreased to 90s ( maps&gt;70 ) , and norepinephrinestarted. the ne was discontinued promptly given bp improvementimmediately , and

lumpectomywith pathology demonstrating 4.1 cm idc , no lvi ,negative sentinel lymph nodes. she underwent partial breast radiationin march 2004 and deferred on adjuvant therapy. in november 2005 , shepresented with atypical chest wall pain and imaging showed bilateralpulmonary nodules , thoracic lymphadenopathy , and pleural effusionconsistent with metastatic disease. a bone scan showed widespread osseous metastatic disease and head ct demonstrated a cnsinvolvement. she was treated with whole brain radiotherapy in march2006 and with weekly taxol. she continued through march2006. restaging studies showed stable visceral disease butprogression of bony metastatic disease. therefore on january , 2006 ,she initiated a second-line navelbinetherapy. physicalexamination: vital signs:
