record date: 2081-09-30 endocrinology fellow consult notedate: 	09-30-2081name:	nicole frantzmrn:	236-07-19	requesting service:	medicinereason for consultation:   diabetes, gastroparesis	hpi:  52-yo woman with poorly-controlled dm diagnosed 2061 and h/o gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, and  with multiple visits and three recent admissions for n/v/gastroparesis: may 1-3and june 7-21, july 22. her gi symptoms began in december, 2080. delayed gastric emptying by nuclear medicine study, with 9% emptying at 60 minutes and 29% emptying at 90 minutes. originally, she had been on oral medication and has been on insulin since 2076, initially on nph bid and then switched to lantus.  after her admission june 2081, she was placed back on nph from what had been lantus 40 u qhs + metformin 1000 bid. hba1c was 12.2, 4/2081, more recently it has been 10.2 in 7/2081 and 10.1 on 9/14/2081. on her last visit to see me in diabetes counseling approximately 10 days ago, gastroparesis was under good control without nausea or vomiting. glycemic control, however, was poor, and it was clear to me that she was not properly administering a sliding scale, and this was too complex for her. accordingly, and in response to severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin a1c above 10, we changed her reigimen to nph 70/30 50units bid. her known diabetic complications include retinopathy with prior photocoagulopathy, nephropathy with microalbuminuria, neuropathy with intermittent numbness and tingling at night in feet, and no known macrovascular disease. gastroparesis may be the consequence of poor glycemic control or frank autonomic neuropathy, but is often multifactorial. she was re-admitted to the psh on 09/30/2081 after having 2 days of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. she was unable tolerate any oral hydration in the ed, and was admitted for management. on rosystems and history, she reports that she had been taking her new 70/30 insulin, 50 units bid. sugars had been running 200s, all the time 200s, no better or worse. nausea per her report began suddenly on friday evening 09/27 and got gradually worse. currently nausea has abated, but abdominal pain persists.written only for insulin sliding scale. glucose 500+ on admission with anion gap of 20 that closed rapidly with hydration.  pmh: 1)	dm (from 2061a)2)	gastroparesis 3)	retinopathy (s/p

repeated admission for nausea, vomiting, poor nutrition. found to be profoundly hyperglycemic on admission with bg of 526 with anion gap of 20. rapidly closed anion gap to 10 with hydration alone.  abdominal pain can be multifactorial. i don't doubt that this is most likely hyperglycemia with associated gut dysmotility, but differential includes small bowel angina (pain is definitely out of proportion to exam and seems colicky), hepatobiliary disease. with normal anion gap, i doubt that this is ischemic disease of the gut, but small bowel angina is still a possibility. recommendations: 1)	 gastroparesis may be in part due to poor glycemic control, we need to achieve better glycemic control to help with gastric motility. a.	would not hold long acting insulin. start nph 30u bid,    dose if npob.	while npo, have d5 running in ivf once fingerstick drops below 200, especially once nph started. if she needs ivf at a higher rate, you might run d5ns at 50cc/hour along with ns or    ns at whatever rate is needed.c.	continue sliding scale insulin q6h when npo, qac and qhs when eating, but change parameters to tighten coverage as follows:i.	fingerstick <150, 0 units; 151-200 4 units; 201-250 6 units; 251-300 8 units; 301-350 10 units, >350 12 units. d.	start mealtime insulin (clearly hold while npo) of 10u regular pre-breakfast and pre-dinner. hold if npo or po intake poor. she will need rapid uptitration from this point once eating. e.	no metformin for now given gi upset. 2)	agree with other therapies for gastroparesis as she had been on as an outpatient, including ativan, reglan, zofran prn, zelnorm, miralax, colace. 3)	for crude r/o of poor circulation to gut you could send a lactate level and check stool guaiac. colonoscopy and endoscopic exams were normal earlier this year, but this does not exclude small bowel angina. study of choice would be mr angiography or ct angiography of abdominal vessels. i do not think this is warranted at this point, but ischemic small bowel should remain on the differential.  4)	with hyperdynamic precordium and tachycardia, would check tsh, though this is almost certainly due to hypovolemia and compensatory response. thank you for the consult.  we will follow with you.  please call with any questions.will staff in am. 		______________________	mark kenney, md, phd	pager # 12036
