htn whopresented with generalized weakness, altered mental status,slurred speech and increased frequency of small amounts ofurination.  he was found to be in acute renal failure at an oshand transferred here to [hospital1 18] for possible hemodialysis.  he wasstabilized medically in the icu until [7-16] when his care wastransitioned to the general medicine service.acute issues# acute renal failure: he presented in acute renal failure withcreatinine of 10.4 (baseline 0.9), hyperkalemia, and ekgchanges.   his arf was largely attributed to obstruction as hewas retaining over 500cc urine and found to have large symmetricprostate on dre.  however, no hydronephrosis seen on ultrasound. additionally, he was also on a number of potentiallynephrotoxigenic medications causing atn, including lisinopril,nsaids, and potassium citrate. he was initially medicallymanaged in the icu ivf, lasix, bicarb with good effect.  renalfunction gradually improved over several days following catheterplacement, fluid support, and discontinuation of nephrotoxigenicdrugs.  he was discharged with a cr of 5.7, and not restarted onhis nephrotoxic meds.  he will be followed by renal as anoutpatient.  furthermore, he was started on tamsulosin for hisbph.  his foley remained in place to allow [5-26] day bladder restbefore urology will try voiding trial as an outpatient in thenext few days.#hyperkalemia: he was found to have an elevated k 8 withassociated peaked t waves. potassium levels dropped withadministration of kayexalate, insulin, and bicarbonate. serialekgs also showed resolution of peaked t waves.#dm ii: prior to this admission, he was only taking oralhypoglycemics.  however, these were discontinued in light of hisarf.  his blood sugars were managed on sliding scale insulin.since he required humalog 5-7 units for the last 3 days ofhospitalization, he was sent home on lantus 2units qhs withlispro sliding scale coverage.  he will be followed by his pcpin the next 2-3 days for follow-up  of this new diabetesregimen.  he was also provided with an educational counselingsession regarding home insulin.  his oral hypoglycemics wereheld, with the goal of transitioning back to agents after renalapproval and cr normalization.#bph:  as above, his bph contributed to urinary obstruction andarf.  dre revealed symmetric enlargement of prostate.  previousbiopsy was benign.  was started on tamsulosin this admission.urology will follow in clinic for void trial.chronic issues# hypertension: he was found to be hypertensive to sbp 180sduring the admission as his ace-i was held in light of his arf.after transfer to the floor, he was continued on his amlodipine5mg and metoprolol succinate 100 daily.  quinapril discontinuedindefinitely. tamsulosin added for bph.# hyperlipidemia: stable, continued his home statin.transitional issues-urology outpatient follow up: the patient will be called byurology for an appointment this week.  until then, foley willremain in place and he will be visited by vna for foley-relatedcare.-renal outpatient follow up to readdress kidney function andpossibility of restoring prior home meds: quinapril, metformin,glipizide-pcp follow up in the next couple days to follow up glucosecontrol on newly started insulin regimen and antihypertensiveregimen, and side effects to newly started tamsulosin.
