sounds.  her musculoskeletal examination was notable for pain upon abduction and external rotation of her left shoulder.  there was ulnar deviation of the fingers of her right hand.  there was a boutonniere deformity of her left ring finger.  bilateral hallux valgus deformities and cock-up toe deformities were present on both feet.  there was full painless motion of all small and large joints in both arms and legs without evidence of joint inflammation or of other significant joint deformity.  her neurologic examination was notable for decreased sensation to light touch in the distribution of her right ulnar nerve, but was otherwise normal.  her neurologic examination was normal with normal mental status, normal function of cranial nerves ii through xii, normal muscle strength and tone in both arms and legs, intact sensation to light touch throughout, normal coordination, and symmetric deep tendon reflexes with downgoing plantar reflexes bilaterally.  laboratory data:  i reviewed

when she takes darvocet n-100.  she will continue taking her other medications at their present doses.   laboratory studies will be performed today to assess her cbc, wbc differential count, plasma creatinine, alt, ast, serum albumin, esr, and crp.   ms. do will return to see me on december 11, 2109, at 9:40 a.m., so that i may assess her response to continued treatment and make any necessary
