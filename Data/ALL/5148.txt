locally recurrent melanoma involving hisface, status post excision, neck dissection and radiationtherapy.  initial staging was consistent with stage iii cdisease but now with mets to the lung, bone and soft tissue.he was due to be started on high-dose il-2 but in clinic on[2178-1-12], he was noticed to have erythema in an area ofrecent lymph node dissection felt consistent with cellulitis,and was started on oral keflex, and now is presenting withworsening erythema.  the patient reports that in the weeksince he started antibiotics, the erythema has enlarged andbecome more red.  in clinic today, his white blood cell countwas up to 20,000 and he was admitted to omed service.past medical history:  hypertension, metastatic melanoma withoriginal diagnosis in [2177-6-5].  on [2177-8-21] he underwentwide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, withmelanoma present in 1 left intraparotid node.  on [2177-8-28]he had re-excision of the left temple and cheek area and aleft radical neck dissection, with melanoma in 7 of 69 totallymph nodes.  he underwent radiation therapy to the foreheadarea, completing 20 fractions over 4 weeks.  he thendeveloped soft tissue nodule superior to the graft, thatmight have represented residual melanoma and appeared to havereduced in size with radiation.in late [2177-10-6] a pet ct showed increased glucoseuptake at sites of surgery on his thigh and around thesuperior edge of the graft on his face.  he was seen infollow-up one of three weeks after completion of radiation.follow up head mri and torso ct on [2178-1-7] revealed nometastatic brain lesions, but metastatic disease in hischest, left axilla, mediastinum and lung, as well as a t12sclerotic focus felt consistent with melanoma.  the brcamutation testing on his tumor was negative.  he has passedscreening tests to begin high-dose il-2 therapy.allergies:  no known drug allergies.medications on admission:  enalapril 20 mg p.o. daily,pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, keflex 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.physical examination on admission:  reveals an elderly malein no apparent distress.  heent:  pupils equal, round,reactive to light.  left temporal and buccal graft withouterythema.  neck:  well-healed scar from posterior auriculararea to the left upper chest.  no signs of wound dehiscence.broad area of erythema and corresponding area warm to touch.no palpable masses or fluid collections.  no cervical,supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.  heart:  regularrate and rhythm, s1, s2.  chest:  no dullness to percussionand clear to auscultation bilaterally.  abdomen:  positivebowel sounds, soft, nontender.  extremities:  warm and wellperfused, 1+ edema to [12-8] the way up shins bilaterally, 2+ dpand pt pulses.  neurologic exam:  nonfocal.admission labs:  wbc 20.9,

cellulitisand was placed on iv vancomycin.  doxycycline was added whenhe did not appear to be improving.  unasyn was added when thecellulitic area continued to worsen.  he also became short ofbreath and was treated with lasix.  transthoracic echorevealed diastolic heart failure and he was continued onenalapril and lasix.  he had an id consult on [1-28] whosuggested stopping the unasyn, changing to cefepime andadding vancomycin back.  blood cultures remained negative andhe was afebrile throughout this time.  derm consult on [1-28]was obtained due to persistent rash, and a biopsy wasperformed consistent with melanoma.  he was subsequentlytransferred to the biologic service on [2178-1-30] to beginhigh-dose il-2 therapy.during this week he received 7 of 14 doses with 7 doses heldrelated to tachycardia and pulmonary edema.  on treatment day#4, he was tachypneic with hypoxia to the mid 80s.  chest x-ray was consistent with bilateral pleural effusions.throughout the day he became increasingly more tachypneic andfatigued, and was transferred to the icu.  he was treatedwith lasix with improvement in his respiratory status.  anechocardiogram on [2178-2-3] showed a small pericardialeffusion with question tamponade physiology.  cardiology wasconsulted and felt they were not able to tap the effusion.he underwent a cardiac mri on [2178-2-4] revealing no cardiacmetastases and no tamponade physiology.he developed svt to the 140s on [2178-2-4], whichspontaneously improved with a fluid bolus.  his respiratorystatus improved with continued diuresis, and he wastransferred back to the floor on [2178-2-5].  lasix andenalapril were continued and he was weaned to room air witho2 saturations in the mid 90s.physical therapy consult was initiated and he was ambulatingshort distances with a steady gait.  he was discharged tohome on [2178-2-7] with a plan to follow up in clinic on[2178-2-10].other side effects related to il-2 included rigors improvedwith demerol; fatigue; and hypotension on treatment day 3,requiring fluid boluses.  during this week he developed acuterenal failure with a peak creatinine of 3.0 with associatedoliguria.  he developed metabolic acidosis with a minimumbicarb of 18, improved with bicarbonate boluses.electrolytes were monitored and repleted per protocol.strict i & os and serum chemistries were maintained.  ivfluids were continued given acute renal failure.during this week he had mild st elevation to 54, whichimproved prior to discharge.  he had no hyperbilirubinemia,myocarditis or coagulopathy noted.  he was thrombocytopenicto a platelet count low of 68,000 without evidence ofbleeding.  he was anemic and was transfused with packed redblood cells with discharge hemoglobin of 9.1.  by [2178-2-7]he had recovered from side effects to allow for discharge tohome.condition on discharge:  alert, oriented and ambulatory.discharge status:  to home with his family.discharge diagnoses:1. metastatic melanoma status post cycle 1, week 1, high-    dose il-2 therapy complicated by pulmonary edema, and    bilateral pleural effusions from il-2 induced capillary    leak, with respiratory distress.2. acute renal failure related to il-2 therapy.discharge medications:  enalapril 20 mg p.o. daily, lasix 20mg p.o. daily, lorazepam 0.5 mg q. 6 hours p.r.n. nausea,pravastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, compazine 5 to 10 mg q.i.d.p.r.n.
