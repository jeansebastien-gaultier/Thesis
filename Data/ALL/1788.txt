 i was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on mrs.tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listedas a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  in summary, she isa 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabeticsince the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  byreport, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  in viewingher present history, she works in the houghton mifflin harcourt learning technology department.  herthree times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  she does,however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities andon rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  these episodes arerelieved by nitroglycerin.  mrs. tinsley has also noted that withwalking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relievedby slowing down.        in addition to diabetes and hypertension which was presentonly pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  hercholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  i don't havefractionations and her family history is unknown.        a report of an echocardiogram from april of 2083, shows mildventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,preserved lv size and function.  she had an exercise tolerance testin february of 2085.  on a modified protocol, she went for lessthan 4 1/2 minutes.  this is equivalent to not even completingstage 1 of the standard bruce.  with that, she did develop chestpain and had 2 mm of st depression. that study was accompanied byboth fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septumconsistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise inducedischemia.  as was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotopeportion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and ledto the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.        that study was done in macdonald hospital and at this time, ionly have the report.  however, from this report, there waspreserved lv function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and tracemr that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement ofproximal mid-lad without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-lad.  the circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was adiscrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  theright coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discretestenosis.  at that time, the recommendation was to continue medicaltherapy.        her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement withprempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one everyother day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twicedaily insulin therapy.        in rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedureshave involved the hemodialysis access.  she has had one pregnancy28 years ago without complications.  i also elicited a history ofsome focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  thiswas difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.      on exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm hg, pulse 90regular, her weight 95 lbs.  her hemodialysis shunt is on the leftarm.  there was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were notdistended.  lungs were clear, pmi was displaced and sustained. there was an s4, no s3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at theapex.  abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremitieswere without edema.  the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,diffuse stt changes.  there were no pathologic q waves.      although the focus of this evaluation was originally fortransplant candidacy, i am concerned about her current cardiacstatus.  she is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of bothshortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, haslimited functional capacity.  the coronary angiography reveals apresence of multi-vessel disease.  even without seeing the primarydata which i hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely thatshe would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery bypass surgery.        obviously, i would like to review the films first, and speakwith dr. upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  iwould also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  asindicated, although the focus of this evaluation was hersuitability for transplantation, the issue of controllingsymptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became morepressing.      i look forward to working with you and the other physicians inher care.                                     sincerely,
