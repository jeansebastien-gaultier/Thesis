junctionaltachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity. her digoxin wasdiscontinued and per ep's recommendations was not restarted andwill be held indefinitely. in order to maintain k levels above4.0 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia,spironolactone 25mg po daily was started. on this regimen thepatient required 40meq of kcl po daily to maintain her k levelsand this was reduced to 20meq daily as the k level on the dayprior to discharge was 4.5. on discharge the k level was 4.3.for heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to aneventual dose of 75mg po bid the day prior to discharge, duringwhich time the patient's bp was stable at sbp=110s to 130s. onthe day of discharge metoprolol 75mg [hospital1 ] was increased to toprolxl 200mg to help control sbp that were in the upper 120s.following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developedright le pain, which was attributed to a radiculpathy and wassuccessfully treated with neurontin 100mg tid. due topredominately left le weakness, pt was consulted and recommendedthat the pt be discharged to an extended care factility whereshe could receive further care from pt. the patient continued toimprove during the course of her stay, but was it was stillconsidered necessary that the pt receive rehab upon d/c. priorto discharge the patient was prescribed an afo left foot splint.in addition she spiked a temperature to 100.3, for which aninfection work-up was began. urine cx showed proteus mirabilis,bld cx negative. she was treated impirically on vacnomycin,which was d/c after the bld cx came back negative, andciprofloxacin. p. mirabilis was found to be intermediatelysensitive to ciprofloxacin and tx was switched to a sensitiveantibiotic, ceftriaxone 500mg po q12h for 10 days. ceftriaxonewas stopped on [2133-6-29] and the patient remained afebrile andasymptomatic. both incisions healed well without currentdrainage, erythema, edema, or tenderness.lastly during her hospital course she developed some bladderirritation/spasms and hematuria likely due to foley cathetertrauma. the catheter was d/c'ed and she was treated with detrolfor a couple of days.  she has since been asymmptomatic andwithout hematuria.medications on admission:lanoxin 0.25mg po dailycoumadinflexerilvicodinmehtylprednislone dose backapo-amilizide 50/5 mg po dailytensiomin (chinese med) 25 mg po dailytake chinese herbs and teasdischarge medications:1. spironolactone 25 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily(daily).2. warfarin sodium 1 mg tablet sig: 3.5 tablets po hs (atbedtime).3. gabapentin 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po q8h (every8 hours).4. oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg tablet sig: 1-2 tablets poq4-6h (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain.5. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day) as needed for constipation.6. potassium chloride 20 meq packet sig: one (1) packet po oncea day.7. toprol xl 200 mg tablet sustained release 24hr sig: one (1)tablet sustained release 24hr po once a day.discharge disposition:extended carefacility:[hospital6 85] - [location (un) 86]discharge diagnosis:epidural hematoma s/p evacuation, periop brady/pause s/p singlewire pacemaker placement, non-sustained ventricular tachycardiasecondary to digoxin toxicitydischarge condition:stabledischarge instructions:please take all medications as prescribed. contact primary carephysician or return to hospital if experience chest pain,shortness of breath, palpitations, worsening lower extremityweakness, or other concerns.followup instructions:the following appointments have been scheduled for you:1.
