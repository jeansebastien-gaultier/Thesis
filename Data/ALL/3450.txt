:she had palpable pulses in the lower extremities .the only significant finding on musculo-skeletal examination was a swollen left knee with intact skin .she had 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper extremities .she had 5 out of 5 right lower extremity strength and 3 out of 5 quadriceps and anterior tibialis strength on the left side secondary to pain and 5 out of 5 extensor hallucis longus ,

underwent open reduction , internal fixation of her left patellar fracture .there were no complications and a hemo dressing was placed .the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and then to the floor in stable condition .there was no evidence of anesthesia difficulties due to her past medical history of asthma .at this point the initially plan was to have no active knee extension , to use a continuous passive motion machine with a goal of 0 to 45 degrees range of motion .if she was to be up and ambulating weight bearing as tolerated .when she was up and out of bed her knee was to be locked in full extension .on postoperative check there were no active issues .on postoperative day number one she had no complaints .she had initial fevers of 102.2 postoperatively but this temperature spike declined and she was afebrile after postoperative day number one .her hemovac had minimal output of 30 cc. in the first 12+ hours
