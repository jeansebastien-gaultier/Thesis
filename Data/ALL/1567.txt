room air , weight94.3 kg. general appearance: the patient is in no acutedistress at present. heent: oropharynx is clear. there is nopalatal petechiae. pupils are equally round and reactive tolight and accommodation. there is no scleral icterus present.neck: supple. there is no lymphadenopathy or masses present.cardiovascular: rate is irregularly irregular. it isbradycardic. there is a 2/6 systolic

crackles.abdomen: obese. there are positive bowel sounds. abdomen issoft , nondistended and nontender. no rebound tenderness orguarding. skin: there is no stigmata of endocarditis. thereare no splinter hemorrhages. no osler nodes or red spots. thereis 1+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. thereare 1+ distal pulses in the upper and lower extremitiesbilaterally. neuro: the patient is alert and oriented x3 andexam was nonfocal.laboratory data: at the time of admission , sodium 144 , potassium4.5 , chloride 106 , bicarb 30 , bun 41 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 83 ,anion gap is 8. white blood cell count of 8.1 , hematocrit 31.7 ,platelets 332 , 000. there are 71% neutrophils , 14% lymphocytesand 12% monocytes. calcium is 8.7. urinalysis shows traceblood , 3+ leukocyte esterase. 40-50 white blood cells , 1-5 redblood cells , trace bacteria.studies at the time of admission.1. chest x-ray shows status post midline sternotomy and cabg.there is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette , which isunchanged from prior x-rays. right lung is clear. there is asmall left posterior pleural effusion , which has been reduced insize compared to his previous x-ray dated 7/11/07 . 2. ekg revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm with atrialfibrillation with a rate of 44. there is left axis deviation , aright bundle-branch block and q waves in ii , iii and avf , whichis unchanged from an ekg in 0/17 . hospital course by problem: this is an 82-year-old gentlemanwith a history of multiple medical problems most significantlyincluding recent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis , cadstatus post cabg , chf , atrial fibrillation with a slowventricular response who was transferred from rehabilitation witha fever , positive urinalysis and positive blood cultures withconcerns for endocarditis given his recent avr. the patient wasinitially started on ceftazidime and vancomycin empirically.blood cultures were obtained and the patient grew outtwo out of two bottles of gemella morbillorum from his blood.urinary cultures were also obtained , which revealed 10 , 000colonies of pseudomonas aeruginosa. cultures were also takenfrom the suprapubic catheter wound site and revealed rare mrsa ,few coag-negative staph and rare enterococci. once bloodcultures for gemella morbillorum returned , the patient'santibiotics were changed to gentamicin and ceftriaxone on5/8/07 .  ceftazidime was discontinued as was vancomycin. thepatient remained afebrile while inhouse and did not exhibit anysignificant leukocytosis or stigmata of endocarditis.surveillance cultures obtained after starting antibiotics haveremained negative to date. a tte was obtained and was negativefor any valvular vegetation. however , given the patient's highrisk for endocarditis , a tee was obtained , which was alsonegative for any ring abscess or valvular vegetation. thepatient , however , will be treated for endocarditis given his highrisk.1. cardiovascular:ischemia: the patient had no chest pain , chest tenderness orchest discomfort. he does have a history cad status post cabgand was continued on his full strength aspirin. he was alsocontinued on statin.pump: the patient was volume overloaded at the time of admissionand was treated with 60 mg of iv lasix. following this , heappeared euvolemic and lasix was held for several days and thengradually became volume overload and was again given 60 mg of ivlasix and then restarted on his home dose of 80 mg p.o. qam. at thetime of discharge , the patient is slightly volume overloaded , butdiuresing well with 80 mg daily. the patient's losartan was heldin the setting of his chronic renal insufficiency and initiationof gentamicin therapy. at the time of discharge , his weight is96.6 kg. his i/o goal at time of d/c is 500cc negative daily. he shouldcontinue daily weights. of note , the patient's dry weight isapproximately 93 kg. pt's lasix should be titrated as he reaches his dry weight.rhythm: the patient is bradycardic at baseline down into themid-to-low 30s , is asymptomatic and has in the past refusedpermanent pacemaker placement. all nodal agents should beavoided for this reason. the patient did have several runs ofnonsustained ventricular tachycardia upto 14 beats. electrolyteswere checked twice daily to keep magnesium above 2 and potassiumabove 4. however , no other medical management was initiatedgiven his bradycardia.2. infectious disease: as noted above , there was high suspicionfor endocarditis in this with a recent avr. he was found to havegemella morbillorum in his blood and was started as noted aboveempirically on vancomycin and ceftazidime and then changed togentamicin and ceftriaxone on 5/8/07 once gram-positive cocciwere speciated. the patient was initially treated forpseudomonal uti with five days of ceftazidime , but given thatonly 10000 cfus grew out , it was decided that ceftazidimecould be discontinued and that there would be some response toceftriaxone plus gentamicin. a picc line was placed on 5/8/07for continued iv antibiotics and the patient should continue afull six-week course of ceftriaxone and at least a two-weekcourse of gentamicin for presumed endocarditis despiteboth negative transthoracic echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogramgiven his high risk for endocarditis.3. gi: the patient was continued on his home dose of protonixand all his stools were guaiaced and were negative in house. thepatient should be continued on p.r.n. colace.4. endocrine: the patient has a history of insulin dependentdiabetes mellitus. his lantus was titrated up to 36 unitsnightly and at that level required no sliding scale insulin.5. renal: the patient was found to have a slightly elevatedcreatinine above his baseline on admission ( 1.9 with a baselineof 1.1 to 1.3 ). this elevated creatinine was thought to likelybe due to his chf and poor forward flow. as the patient wasdiuresed , his creatinine decreased to 1.4 at the time ofdischarge. given his creatinine elevation , however , his losartanwas held and this should be held while the patient is on gentamicin.6. gu: the patient has a history of bph and at the time ofadmission had a suprapubic catheter that was inserted in 0/24due to difficulty to pass foley catheter. the catheter wasclamped and post-void residuals were checked and were only 50 mland the patient was urinating without difficulty with tube clamped ,so urology was consulted and suprapubic catheter was pulledwithout difficulty. suprapubic wound was dressed with a steriledry dressing to be changed daily.7. fluids , electrolytes and nutrition: the patient has acurrent input and output goal of 0.5 l negative daily. he is on a 2l fluidrestriction.electrolytes. the patient has been having twice dailyelectrolyte checks to keep his magnesium above 2 and hispotassium above 4 given his arrhythmias while he is on 80 mg oflasix daily. this should be continued.nutrition. the patient was placed on a cardiac , 2-gm sodiumdiet and a 2 l fluid restriction.8. pulmonary: the patient is to continue on flovent andalbuterol.9. heme: the patient was continued on niferex twice daily foriron deficiency anemia. he was also found to have a very mildeosinophilia , which should be followed.10. derm: the patient was found to have a skin tear on hisright hand. this is being treated with neomycin ointment andsterile dry dressing changes daily.11. prophylaxis: the patient was placed on subcutaneous heparin5000 units three times daily and continued on his ppi.code: the patient is full code.physical examination at the time of discharge: vital signs:temperature 98.7 , blood pressure is 118-140/60-70 , heart rate35-58 , respiratory rate 18-20 , oxygen saturation 94-100% on roomair , 100% on 2 l. weight 96.6 kg. on general exam , the patientis in no acute distress. neuro: the patient is alert andoriented x3. pulmonary: there are decreased breath sounds aquarter of the way up on the left lung field and there aredecreased breath sounds at the bases on the right lung field.cardiovascular: there is an irregularly irregular rhythm andwith bradycardia. there is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at theright upper sternal border. jvp is 5-6 cm of water. abdomen:there are normoactive bowel sounds present. abdomen is soft ,obese , nondistended and nontender. suprapubic catheter site iswithout purulence or erythema. extremities: there is 1+ pittingedema to the shins bilaterally with chronic venous stasis changesbilaterally.
