to her upper back.  it was associated with nausea but no vomiting or diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  it did radiate down both arms, but she her arm pains are now new.  it was not relieved by any positioning, or largely affected by taking deep breaths.  it tapered off over about 20 minutes.  she felt fatigued and layed down, when it occurred again several hours later, again lasting for about 20 minutes.  she then presented to dca-ed for evaluation.  she had a negative adenosine mibi at jmh in 2078.she has had a difficult time recently, she is under evaluation for a lupus-like syndrome (she has noted positivity for ana, anti-smith, anti-dsdna).  she has had progressive joint and muscle pain of all of her major joints (ankes, knees, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, lumbar back) and the muscles of her arms and legs.  she endorses progressive mental &#8220;cloudiness&#8221;, frequently dropping items like cutlery and cups, and increasing tremor in her hands.dca ed course:initial ekg nsr without ischemic changesinitial biomarkers strongly positive with ckmb 33 and troponin 0.36.  cxr unremarkable.she was treated for nstemi with asa 325 mg x 1, heparin gtt, iv lopressor.she had a brief episode of cp which was relieved by sl ntg and morphine.she was sent to sdu for further evaluation and treatment. ros (positive findings denoted)constitutional: fatiguehead/eyes: occ dizzinessent/neck: uri sx two weeks ago, chronic neck painchest/respiratory: see hpigi/abdominal: deniescardiovascular: see hpimusculoskel/extr/back: see hpineuro: see hpimedical historyhx of pancreatitisquestion of sle;
