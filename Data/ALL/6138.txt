[known lastname 92101] is a 59yo woman who presented w/ altered mentalstatus in the setting of hep c cirrhosis.# altered mental status: given her hx of hep c cirrhosis andrecent tips procedure, her ams was thought to be most likely dueto hepatic encephalopathyy. she was reported to have a hx ofpoor compliance with lactulose at home.  of note, she has nothad other episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.head ct at osh was negative.  given her leukocytosis onadmission, infection, particularly sbp or pneumonia, were alsoconsidered. overdose was also a possibility, although familydenies drug use. upon arrival in the micu she was started onlactulose and rifaximine. she underwent a paracentesis to evalfor sbp, which had a negative gram stain and culture. given herams, she was considered high risk for aspiration, and she wasstarted on empiric treatment with vanc/aztreonam/azithromycin(allergic to cipro and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration pnavs sbp. while there was no known hx of etoh abuse, thiamine ivwas administered. on exam the pt had some focal findings ofpersistent right-[hospital1 ] and downward deviation of her eyes, withinability to track past midline. she had a repeat head ct and anmri/mra which were both without evidence of significantpathology. following extubation and decreased sedation, hermental status improved and the focal eye findings resolved.while not back at her baseline, pt was awake, alert, andoriented x3 when she was transferred to the floor. pt seen byneurology, but had already had significant improvement and nofocal findings. on the floor, her mental status continued toimprove. at time of discharge, she is back to baseline,conversational, oriented x3 but at times is tearful. she isbeing discharged on rifaximin and furosemide..# respiratory failure: patient was intubated for airwayprotection at osh.  her cxr here suggested a possible aspirationpneumonia, which could have been [3-12] to her ams.  it is unclearif she received ivf at osh. she was weaned off of the ventquickly as she required minimal pressure support and had goodrsbis. she was extubated on [2185-11-17] was satting well on room airat the time of transfer to the floor. on discharge, shecontinues to have oxygen saturations in the high 90's on roomair..# rash: pt arrived in the micu with three skin findings. bullae,blisters/breakdown, and a  diffuse maculopapular rash onproximal legs and trunk. dermatology was consulted. the blistersand bullae were thought to be [3-12] trauma in the setting ofcoagulopathy due to liver disease and thinned skin. urineporphobilinogens were checked to rule out porphyria in thesetting of hep c liver disease and were negative. the diffusemaculopapular rash appeared to be new, and looks more like ahypersensitivity reaction, likely to ertapenem. pt has knownallergies to keflex ad cipro, and had received ertapenem at theosh. she was treated with topical clobetasol cream to the rashon abdomen and lower extremities (avoiding folds), andhydrocortisone 2.5% cream to rash in folds of abdomen and groin.also, the bullae over time evolved into ulcerations on the pt'slegs, arms and left shoulder which were treated with wound careas recommended by our wound care team and plastics..# cirrhosis [3-12] hep c: pt was treated as described above withlactulose and rifaximine as well as a ppi, and was followed byhepatology.  she had a ruq ultrasound on [11-16] and again on [11-23]which showed her tips was patent. she should have a repeats tipsultrasound in 1 month. she had a 5l paracentesis on [11-20] whichwas negative for increased wbc and culture was sterile..# vre: pt had blood culture [11-16] which grew vre sensitive todaptomycin and linezolid in [2-11] bottles. daptomycin was startedon [11-17].  id was consulted in house. tte showed no vegetationson [11-24].  the pt should be continued on iv daptomycin tocomplete a 14 day course on [2185-12-2]..# sinus tachycardia: pt was likely intravascularly dry onadmission given hct above baseline, poor urine output, andtachycardia above baseline, although some level of tachyardiaappears to be chronic in her.  also may be exacerbated by acuteillness. she received albumin 25g in 500cc ns x2 and her hr andurine output were followed. her diuretics were held until thenext morning. at discharge, her hr remains in the 80's to 90's..# chronic diastolic heart failure: appeared hypovolemicadmission, her diuretics were held as above. her diuretics weregradually restarted on the floor. she is not accumulatingascited at the time of discharge..# chronic kidney disease:  baseline cr 1.8-2.0, cr on discharge1.5, urine output initially poor on admission, but improvedafter fluid challenge..# thyroid nodule: should be followed up as outpatient..# hyponatremia: pt has chronic hyponatremia seen on pastadmission with baseline 128-130. as diuretics were increased,her sodium gradually decreased to 129 on day of discharge.treatment ongoing for this condition should include ongoingfluid restriction to approximately 1500cc/day..# hypercalcemia: pt had transient hypercalcemia to 10.8 thisadmission thought to be [3-12] calcium and vitamin d use at home.these were stopped and ca is now 9.9 at time of discharge.recommend not restarting these medications at this time..# [name (ni) 1867] pt with
