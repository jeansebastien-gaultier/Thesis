.associated diagnosis :1. deep venous thrombosis ,2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .special procedures and operations :10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .history of present illness :the patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at tonland county medical center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .she was transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .past medical history :as documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .medications on admission :atenolol 25 mg po q.day , procardia xl 60 mg po q.day , pepcid 20 mg po b.i.d. , isordil 10 mg po t.i.d.allergies :the patient has no known drug allergies .physical examination :on physical examination on admission , she is an elderly woman with labored respirations .her blood pressure was 148/65 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , temperature was afebrile .her head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination showed normocephalic , atraumatic head , oropharynx was clear , her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally .cardiovascular exam :ii / vi systolic ejection murmur .the heart exam revealed a normal sl and s2 .the abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .extremities :2+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities .her neurological examination revealed that she was awake and alert at the time of her arrival to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and was moving all extremities to commands with pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation .her extra ocular movements were intact .laboratory data :significant for normal electrolytes , bun and creatinine of 27 and 1.1 , electrocardiogram which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with t wave inversions in v2 through v6 .the chest x-ray showed a left pleural effusion .hospital course :the patient arrived at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital and given her history of variably responsive state , and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the operating room after consultation with the medicine service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .it was felt that her prior evaluation at the ona hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .however , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .the patient tolerated the initial procedure well .on the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .she was awake and following commands .it was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .the patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past medical history .the patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .she did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .her subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .in addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .she is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .she has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .on 10-28-93 , the patient 's course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .she had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .since that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and coumadinized .her current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .her prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .the patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .we feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at villrow health to continue this effort .medications on discharge :coumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .her dosing has currently been 4-5 mg po qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg po qhs to maintain her level .other medications include :isordil 10 mg po t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .the patient also has been taking fluconazole 100 mg po b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .additionally , cimetidine 400 mg po t.i.d.disposition / plan on discharge :the patient is transferred to villrow health .she should be seen in the neurosurgery service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .she should continue taking coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .she will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at villrow health .dalywoo droreite , m.d.tr :iq / bmotdd :11-4-93td :11/04/93cc :stat
