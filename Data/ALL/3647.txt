keeps forgetting appointments ).then about a week ago , the patient and his wife noted that his gait became even more unsteady , though he did not fall .he also had difficulties navigating through his apartment , having difficulties finding the fridge for example .they were concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed , as had happened in the past , and this prompted them to come to the deanna .no headache , neckpain , nausea , vomiting or focal weakness / numbness .review of systems : denies any fever , chills , weight loss , visual changes , hearing changes , dysphagia , tingling , numbness , bowel-bladder dysfunction , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , dysuria , hematuria , or bright red blood per rectum .his legs have been feeling weaker , bilaterally since the last week .past medical history :1. previous interventricular hemorrhages :06-30 resolved as of repeat head ct one month later , no residual deficits;

no seizure activity was seen .this medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .head ct repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .the plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .he could not get an mri due to his pacemaker .there were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .endocrinologically , bg was monitored to improve outcome in icu setting though he had no history of dm .of note , hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( " borderline dm " ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , vd boots and pud prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .pt was asked to see him for this gait problem .brandon felt well and was seen by pt who suggested a rehab/hahnemann hospital ( worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .medications on admission :amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig : 0.5 tablet po qod - in march , should be on odd days .donepezil 5 mg tablet sig : two ( 2 ) tablet po hs ( at bedtime ) .docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig : one ( 1 ) capsule po bid ( 2 times a day ) .multivitamin capsule sig : one ( 1 ) cap po daily ( daily ) .mirtazapine 30 mg tablet sig : 0.5 tablet po hs ( at bedtime ) .atorvastatin 10 mg tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po at bedtime .ocuvite tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po once a day .artificial tears drops sig : one ( 1 ) drop ophthalmic twice a day : ou .ensure liquid sig : 0.5 to 1 can po three times a day .midodrine 10 mg tablet sig : 1.5 tablets po twice a day : at 8am and noon .ritalin 5 mg tablet sig : see below tablet po see below : 1.5 tablets at 10am ( 7.5mg ) , 1 tablet 2pm ( 5mg ) .prilosec 20 mg capsule , delayed release ( e.c. ) sig : one ( 1 ) capsule , delayed release ( e.c. ) po once a day .guaifenesin 100 mg / 5 ml liquid sig : 01-28 teaspoons po every six ( 6 ) hours as needed for cold symptoms .discharge medications :1. amiodarone 200 mg tablet sig : 0.5 tablet po qod - in march , should be on odd days .2. donepezil 5 mg tablet sig : two ( 2 ) tablet po hs ( at bedtime ) .3. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig : one ( 1 ) capsule po bid ( 2 times a day ) .4. multivitamin capsule sig : one ( 1 ) cap po daily ( daily ) .5. mirtazapine 30 mg tablet sig : 0.5 tablet po hs ( at bedtime ) .6. atorvastatin 10 mg tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po at bedtime .7. levetiracetam 500 mg tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po bid ( 2 times a day ) : on 04-05 , please increase to two tablets bid ( 1000 mg bid ) .8. ocuvite tablet sig : one ( 1 ) tablet po once a day .9. artificial tears drops sig : one ( 1 ) drop ophthalmic twice a day : ou .10. ensure liquid sig : 0.5 to 1 can po three times a day .11. midodrine 10 mg tablet sig : 1.5 tablets po twice a day : at 8 am and noon .12. ritalin 5 mg tablet sig : see below tablet po see below : 1.5 tablets at 10 am ( 7.5 mg ) , 1 tablet 2 pm ( 5 mg ) .13. prilosec 20 mg capsule , delayed release ( e.c. ) sig : one ( 1 ) capsule , delayed release ( e.c. ) po once a day .14. guaifenesin 100 mg / 5 ml liquid sig : 01-28 teaspoons po every six ( 6 ) hours as needed for cold symptoms .discharge disposition :extended caredischarge diagnosis :right sided intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhagedischarge condition :stable - still with difficulty walking , and mental status exam with memory loss c/w dementia , but otherwise no focal weakness .discharge instructions :please call md or return to deanna if new symptoms suggestive of stroke or brain hemorrhage including weakness , numbness / tingling , facial droop , visual changes , vertigo , loss of coordination , or worsened problems with walking .followup instructions :please f/u with dr. hernandez / neurosurgery in 6 weeks - patient will receive a call from the neurosurgery office to set up a repeat head ct prior and to schedule this visit .daniel laura md , phd 13-279completed by : charles rodriguez md 38-818 2019-04-01 @ 1518signed electronically by : dr. stacie henry on : mon 2019-05-06 12:14 pm( end of report )
