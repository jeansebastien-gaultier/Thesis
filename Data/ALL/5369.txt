pt.'s pe resolved s/p 20 mg iv lasix, administration of lopressor, and ntg. he showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. chest ct showed no acute hemorrhage, ptx, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). follow-up official ct read. no contrast was given, therefore, acute sob could not be secondary to contrast allergy. this pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled htn most likely led to the acute decompensation. no evidence of infection. pt. will receive an echo to evaluate for possible worsening lvef s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with lv hypertrophy. f/u bnp. will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.angina - this pt. has ekg changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. will obtain serial enzymes to r/o mi. begin asa, increase lopressor to 50 tid, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of bps, 2lo2 via nasal canula. consider stress test before d/c.prophylaxis - fragmin 5000 sc qd. sob resolved after lasix + lopressor. unlikely pe in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. low threshold for ct pe protocol.gerd-omeprazole.onc - will check uric acid and ldh to eval. for possible tls. unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. ct shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the am._________________________________henderson xin, mdteam 3 interndepartment of internal medicinesaint marys infirmarypager #44348
