complaint:hypoxia and confusionmajor surgical or invasive procedure:nonehistory of present illness:77 y/o m with h/o chf (ef= 40-45% on echo [4-/2104]), atrialfibrillation on coumadin presented to [hospital1 18] as transfer from[hospital6 5016] in [location (un) 7661], ma for further management ofhypoxia due to left upper lobe pneumonia and and ongoingdelirium due to previous aspiration pneumonia (right middlelobe). the patient's current history starts [2104-7-15], when he washospitalized at [hospital1 18] (requiring a brief icu stay) for leftupper lobe pneumonia, treated with levofloxacin x7 day course.he was discharged home with [hospital1 269], but around [7-25] he startedhaving hypoxia (resting o2sat of 95%, ambulatory o2sat of 85%),and also had cloudy urine. he was treated with ciprofloxacinx2-3 days for uti, but because his hypoxia persisted and he hadprogressively worse dyspnea, he was admitted to [hospital1 18] on [7-27]. anew right middle lobe infiltrate was noted on cxr during thatadmission, which was felt to be an aspiration pneumonia. patientwas evaluated by speech and swallow who felt he had silentaspirations. he was treated with an 8 day course of broadantibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) which ended on [2104-8-4]. hewas discharged to [hospital3 ] on the 20th, but on the 21sthe was sent to the [hospital6 5016] because his o2 sats weredown in the 80s. at the osh, a ct chest was performed thatshowed bilateral pulmonary fibrosis with brochiectasic changesand a small acute infiltrate in the left upper lobe. patientreceived 4 days of levofloxacin iv. on the 24th, the patient andhis family requested transfer to [hospital1 18] for further management ofhis treatment because this is where he gets the majority of histreatment..of note, the cta chest from [7-15] states: "extensiveconsolidation involving the left upper lobe, could representinfection. however, given the clinical history of elevated inr,hemoptysis, and lack of symptoms of pneumonia, this couldrepresent pulmonary hemorrhage.".also, since the patient's discharge from first admission, on[7-20] there has been concerns regarding ongoing alteredmental status. for a while, the patient's wife had to havefriends take turns supervising him at home when she was out.geriatrics was involved during the patient's last [hospital1 18]admission for difficult to manage delirium which was feltsomewhat more consistent with that of acute brain injury.psychiatry at [hospital6 5016] saw the patient during hiscurrent admission and felt he was delirious from ongoinghypoxia, and pulmonary disease. prior to his presentation to[hospital1 18] on [7-15], the patient had been functional and travellingthrough [country 18084] where he climbed up to edinburgh castle..upon transfer to the [hospital1 18], the patient was stable. wheninterviewed, however, he was alert and oriented x2 but notmaking much sense in his answers. when asked about his symptoms,he would talk about his coming from [location (un) ] many years ago. hedid endorse trouble breathing and anxiety. the rn noted hecoughed up mucous with blood..review of systems:difficult to get an accurate ros as patient's

[known lastname ] is a 77 year old man with cad, chf, who was admittedwith hypoxia and ams. respiratory failure worsened during hishospital course despite treatments. he was made cmo andterminally extubated on [2104-8-27]. the patient died at 7:03pm...# hypoxia/dyspnea: the patient was transfered from osh withhypoxia and dyspnea. we began treatment of lul pneumoniaempirically with levofloxacin (for cap coverage), vancomycin(hap coverage), and cefepime (for pseudomonal coverage). on thesecond day of hospitalization, levofloxacin was stopped and hewas continued on vanc/cef for total of a 14 day course.  due tothe fact that his pneumonia was not improving since his originaldiagnosis [2104-7-15], pulmonology was consulted. urine legionellawas negative, ldh was elevated at 392.  a ct of the chest on[8-9] showed marked worsening of nonspecific multifocalground-glass opacities and consolidations predominantlyinvolving the left upper, right upper, left lower and portionsof the right lower lobes of infectious v. inflammatory v.hemorrhagic etiology.  bronchoscopy on [8-14] was grossly normal,no signs of hemorrhage (only abnormality small nonobstructingmembrane extending about one-third of the way into the airwaylumen in the posterior segment of the left upper lobe).  balshowed hemosiderin-laden macrophages and multinucleatedhistiocytes and was negative for malignant cells, pcp,[name10 (nameis) 18092], and cmv, and was significant only for 1+ pmns and10-100k yeast, most likely colonizer).  blood cultures werenegative x 5, hiv was negative, aspergillus negative, hepatitisserologies were negative.  infectious w/u was significant onlyfor a positive serum beta glucan (163), and at time of transferto the micu cryptococcus and quantiferon gold were pending.inflammatory w/u negative for anti-gbm negative, complementnormal, anca negative, esr elevated at 60.   he completed a 14day course of vanc/cef without improvement in pulmonary status.repeat chest ct on [8-17] showed interval progression ofmultifocal consolidations, likely representing infections,although inflammatory condition is a possibility as well as newsmall bilateral pleural effusions. he was again started on 40 mgiv lasix daily with appropriate diuresis.  infectious diseasewas consulted on [8-21] and recommended vats for definitivediagnosis as it was not felt that the underlying pulmonaryprocess represented an infectious etiology, however he was notdeemed to be a surgical candidate due to his many comorbidities. per chest ct, there was concern that the ground glass opacitieson repeat chest ct may represent usual interstitial pneumonitis,the treatment of which would be steroids.  on [8-21] he wasstarted on empiric iv solumedrol 80 mg tid which was tapered to80 mg iv bid on [8-23].  repeat cxr on [8-24] showed no significantchange from prior and plans were for steroid taper.throughout hospital stay, mr. [known lastname ] was on supplementary o2 asneeded, incentive spirometry, and albuterol/ipratropium nebs. o2was weaned and sats were consistently in the low 90s on room airand in the mid-high 90s on 2l o2 nc..# delirium: patient came in with delirium, which he did not haveat baseline (was travelling in [country 18084], hiking with family in[month (only) 216]). the likely etiology of his delirium was considered hisongoing infection +/- hospitalizations. ua was performed and wasnegative, a ucx showed no growth, which ruled out uti as thecause of delirium. a ct head at last admission was negative forany intracranial process and repeat head ct on [8-19], obtainedafter an unwitnessed fall from bed with no signs of trauma againshowed no acute intracranial process, again showed small vesselischemic disease, unchanged old lacunar infarcts in thebilateral basal ganglia and extreme capsule, and prominentventricles and sulci. on admission he was initially givenolanzapine 5mg po q6h prn agitation and haldol.  geriatricsfollwoed the patient for management of his persistent deleriumand sundowning and per their recommendations olanzapine wasswithced to seroquel and uptitrated to 12.5 qam and 37.5 qhswith prn seroquel and haldol.  delerium was also managed withsoft restraints and cage bed in order to keep mr. [known lastname ] frominjuring staff and pulling out his lines.neurology was consulted on admission and initially felt hisconfusion was due to his underlying pulmonary process.  however,when he failed to improve despite antibiotics and no source ofinfection was identified, they were reconsulted on [8-21] andrecommended lp, mri w/ and w/o contrast, and eeg due to concernfor limibic encephalitis vs. paraneoplastic process vs. temporallobe epilepsy.  patient is not a candidate for mri due to hiszenith aaa stent graft.  at the time of transfer lp had so farshown normal glucose, protein, and wbc, no organisms on gramstain, no growth on preliminary bacterial, fungal, and acid fastcultures, negative cryptococcal antigen.  csf hsv and vdrlpending at time of transfer.  anti-[doctor last name ] antibodies were negative.serum rpr and [location (un) ]-[location (un) ] antibody panel, and 1,25 vitamin dwere pending.  patient was also undergoing eeg monitoring at thetime of transfer..# chf: the patient has a history of chf (ef 40-45% per tte donein [4-/2104]) and his cxr has presence of some mild pulmonaryedema.  he was initially continued on his home lasix 40 mg po qdfor chf management, and medical management was continued withcontinued carvedilol and losartan.  his lasix was discontinuedfor several days due to worsening delerium and no iv access andnpo status.  repeat chest ct on it was restarted intermittentlyat 40 mg [hospital1 ].  on [8-19] a loud mr murmur was noted on physicalexam and repeat tte was poor quality and showed ef of 30-35%,question of worsening mr, and antero/anterolateral hypokinesis..# cad with h/o mi: isosorbide mononitrate er 30mg daily and asawere held the day after admission for systolic blood pressuresin the low 100s, some bloody sputum and supratherapeutic inr(3.8 on admission).  he was a poor historian and intermittently[month/day (1) 12861] substernal chest pain.  ekgs demonstrated twi in theanterior, anterolateral, and inferolateral leads.  troponinswere elevated at 0.07 to 0.1 with normal ck-mb and cardiologywas consulted and felt this was most likely demand ischemia sohe continued on medical management, asa was restarted, and hewas placed on carvedilol and [last name (un) ] ([last name (un) ] until [8-18] when his crbumped.)  on the morning of transfer, mr. [known lastname ] [last name (titles) 12861] [4-24]substernal chest pressure, as he had intermittently reportedthroughout hospitalization and cardiac enzymes were againchecked and showed troponin 0.02 (down from prior) and ecgshowed no significant change from baseline..# afib: patient was rate controlled on admission and remainedirregularly irregular throughout his hospital course. patienthad an elevated inr (3.8) on admission with no evidence of acutebleed, so coumadin was held but rate control was continued withcarvedilol.  his carvedilol dose was stopped and restarted afterhe developed an episode of a.fib with rvr on [8-13].  inr trendeddown and coumadin was again started on [8-14] at a low dose of 2mg daily.  it was deemed to be safely stopped on [8-16] inpreparation for g-j tube placement in ir, as the patient had noreported history of stroke, and patient was given one dose of 1mg of iv vitamin k on [9-1] and [8-22] (3 mg total).warfarin has been held since [8-18]..# htn: pt has a history of htn. we continued home losartan 100mg tablet until [8-18] when cr bumped..# fen: during previous hospitalizations, patient was evaluatedby speech and swallow who thought he might be having silentaspiration and recommended soft diet and nectar thick fluidswith monitoring when taking in by mouth food and medications. wecontinued soft diet and nectar thick fluid with aspirationprecautions.  video swallow on [8-11] showed aspiration of allconsistencies and he was made npo.  repeat video swallow on [8-15]again showed florid aspiration.  on [8-21] he was allowed to takesips and eat a dysphagia diet because he had been npo for 10days, had poor iv access, and had not tolerated multipleattempts at dobhoff placement on the floor and g-j placement inthe ir suite.  it was also felt that his underlying lung processwas due to a significantly more severe process than aspirationalone.  he was also started on ppn on the evening of [8-22] andreceived intermittent ppn.  on the evening of transfer he waspermitted to receive supervised milkshake spoon-feedingadministered at bedside by his daughter.# hypernatremia:on [8-21] the patient developed hypernatremia to the 140s with amax of 153 on [8-22] in the setting of iv lasix followed by no ivaccess.  he was spoon fed water and intermittently received upd5w with improvement in his na to 144 on the day of transfer([8-24]).# arf:on [8-18] the patient developed a cr bump to 1.4 in the setting oflasix administration.  a true vanc trough the following morningwas elevated at 42.  vancomycin was d/c'd and the patient washydrated with d51/2ns.  his creatinine remained elevated, fenawas <0.1% on [8-24], and his [last name (un) ] and lasix continued to be helduntil the patient triggered on the evening of [8-24], promptinghim to receive 40 mg of iv lasix prior to transfer to the micu.# rash:on admission the patient was noted to have a mild petechial rashand on [8-12] the patient the rash was notably brightlyerythematous, purpuric, confluent, and morbiliform rash andextended to all four extremities and his back.  he has aconcurrent eosinophilia (14.3%).  biopsy was consistent withleukocytoclastic vaculitis.  ddx included vasculitis vs. drugreaction.  he had started cefepime 3-4 days prior to the rash.he was continued on cefepime and the rash resolved as did theeosinophilia (5.5% when last checked on [8-17]).# transaminitis:patient had elevated lfts at admission, statin was held.  lftstrended down, statin was restarted.  lfts inadvertently checked[8-23], mildly elevated again, statin held.medications on admission:1. warfarin 2.5 mg daily2. carvedilol 12.5 mg tablet twice daily3. isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg tablet sustained release daily4. losartan 100 mg tablet daily5. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) daily6. nitroglycerin 0.3 mg tablet, sublingual as needed for chestpain7. simvastatin 80 mg tablet daily8. lasix 40 mg tablet daily9. potassium chloride 20 meq tab sust.rel. daily as neededfor hypokalemia10. olanzapine 2.5 mg tablet, rapid dissolve twice daily11. olanzapine 2.5 mg tablet, rapid dissolve q6h prn severeagitation.discharge medications:nonedischarge disposition:extended caredischarge diagnosis:respiratory failuredischarge condition:dieddischarge instructions:nonefollowup instructions:none                             [initials (namepattern4) ] [last name (namepattern4) ] [name8 (md) ] md [md number(1) 292]
