patient was admitted watylake hospital cardiologyservice and coronary care service.principal diagnoses:1. myocardial infarction.2. ventricular fibrillation arrest.other diagnoses:1. atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.2. diabetes type 2.3. peripheral vascular disease.4. chronic renal insufficiency.5. depression.6. hypercholesterolemia.7. copd ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ).8. history of gi bleed.9. obstructive sleep apnea.10. status post cholecystectomy.11. status post coronary artery bypass graft with aortic valvereplacement.12. history of transfusion reaction.history of present illness: the patient is a 60-year-old malewith coronary artery disease , status post coronary artery bypassgraft in 1982 , also status post bjork-shiley aortic valvereplacement for bicuspid aortic valve , status post redo cabg in1995 with svg to om2 and svg to lad , who presented to nalcon memorial hospital after developing chest pain unrefractory tonitroglycerin. en route to the er , he suffered a ventricularfibrillation arrest , was defibrillated x1 with 120 joules to arhythm of pulseless electrical activity. he then received fluidsand lidocaine bolus and he recovered his pulse and blood pressureand was intubated in the field.of note , the patient had an avr bjork-shiley and saphenous veingraft to lad and left circumflex sequential grafting , originalsurgery in 1982. in 1985 , he underwent reoperation withsaphenous vein graft to lad and saphenous vein graft to om2. hehas had multiple admissions to estatewentlung lufirm community medical center in the pastyear. in september 2003 , he was admitted with chest pain. he ruled infor a non-st elevation myocardial infarction and was taken to thecatheterization lab. at the cath lab in september 2003 , at dotonh/ medical center he had a left main with a tight ostial lesion.he had saphenous vein graft to lad , it was patent , saphenous veingraft to om2 was patent with a tight 95% stenosis proximally inom2 at the touchdown site inhibiting retrograde profusion. itwas determined at this point that pci would be inappropriate. atthat time and echo showed an ef of 25% with moderate mitralregurgitation and right ventricular systolic pressures of 47. hewas medically managed on nitrates , an ace inhibitor ,beta-blocker , digoxin , and lasix. per his wife , he had beendoing well since april of 2003 , only sublingual nitrogens onoccasion , but today , on the day of admission he ate lunch withhis son and then developed his typical substernal chest pain , butthis time did not have relief with sublingual nitrogen x 3. hecalled ems who arrived at the scene and he had the following codestatus mentioned above with a vf arrest and then a pea arrest.on arrival to tonwa medical center he had a heart rate of 132 , bloodpressure 89/61 , and respiratory rate 28. he was given normalsaline 2 liters , dopamine drip , lopressor 5 mg iv push , and hewas paralyzed , at which point it was determined that the patientwould likely need urgent cardiac catheterization for suspectedmyocardial infarction. he was transferred the specce health care cardiac cath lab emergently.past medical history:coronary artery disease , status post cabg as noted above; historyof multiple non-q-wave mis in 1985 and subsequently history ofdiabetes type 2 , peripheral vascular disease , depression , chronicrenal insufficiency , hypercholesterolemia , copd , history of gibleed , peptic ulcer disease , obstructive sleep apnea , atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular response , status postcholecystectomy , status post aortobifem bypass graft in 1987 ,history of transfusion reaction resulting in hemolysis.allergies: he has no known medical allergies.medications on admission: included insulin , isordil , digoxin ,aspirin , folate , lasix , lipitor , lisinopril , metoprolol ,protonix , and coumadin.social history: he is a current smoker. he is a retired truckdriver and he is married.family history: significant for coronary artery disease anddiabetes.physical examination: on presentation to thara healthcare , he had a pulse of 70 , blood pressure 87/54. he wasintubated and had a saturation of 97% on 40% fio2. he wasintubated and sedated. his jvp was 12 cm of water. he had aregular rate and rhythm with normal s1 and s2. no murmurs , rubs ,or gallops. he had a mechanical s2. his abdomen was soft ,nontender , and nondistended. bilateral lower extremities werecool and clammy with 1+ dp and pt pulses bilaterally. he hadecchymosis as a result of his coumadin use.initial labs were significant for a glucose of 220 , a ck of 565with an mb of 74 and troponin of 14.0. hematocrit was 48. hisinr was 1.7. chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate.ekg with sinus rhythm and a left bundle-branch block with rightaxis deviation. also with inferior t-wave inversions and 1-mm stelevation in v3 and 1-mm st depressions in i and o.echocardiogram previously on 3/3 revealed an ef of 39% withinferior hk and ak , lateral hk , inferoapical dk. he had mild mrand aortic radiant of 27/16. the right ventricular systolicfunction is normal.in summary , the patient is a 60-year-old male with chroniccoronary artery disease , now status post a vf arrest in thesetting of non-q-wave myocardial infarction with isolated stelevation in v3. he was admitted for critical care to thecardiac intensive care unit at lungken medical center .hospital course by problem:1. cardiovascular: ischemia: the patient was transferredemergently to the cardiac catheterization lab wherecatheterization revealed severe native 3vd and vein graftdisease. his left main is moderately sized with a distal 60%lesion. the mid lad was proximally occluded after the firstsepta. his left circumference is proximally occluded. thedistal lad after vein graft is without significant disease andthe distal om branch after the vein graft is diffusely diseasedwith focal 99% lesion after the distal anastomosis. saphenousvein graft to lad is patent , saphenous vein graft to om has 99%lesion in distal anastomosis with _____ flow and a tilting diskaortic valve that appears to be functioning normally. insummary , the patient had what was considered to be anonintervenable coronary artery disease and thus he was admittedfor medical management. he received optimal medical managementfor his acute myocardial infarction including aspirin and plavix ,statin , beta-blocker , ace inhibitor as tolerated. his ischemicekg changes have resolved at the time of transfer out of thecoronary care unit and he has been chest pain-free for theremainder of that day. his ck peaked at 1090 on 6/17/03 . pump:the patient was anticoagulated with heparin for a goal ptt of6084 for his bjork-shiley valve. his coumadin was held in thesetting. he had a tte on 6/17/03 , which showed a leftventricular ejection fraction of 25% with inferoposterior hk ,left atrial enlargement , mild to moderate mr , and well-seatedavr. the patient was rapidly weaned off dopamine andneo-synephrine during his icu stay and he was transferred out tothe floor , once he was considered to be euvolemic. rhythm: asnoted above , the patient admitted with status post vf arrest. hewas successfully defibrillated out of that with shock x 1.however , his course was complicated by an episode of atrialfibrillation with rapid ventricular rate up to the 160sassociated with hypotension for which he was electivelycardioverted with shock x 1 to normal sinus rhythm after which hewas loaded with a 10-g amio load , and he has remained in normalsinus rhythm since that episode. however , after the patient hadbeen transferred to the floor and was stable , he received asingle lead aicd given his history of dilated cardiomyopathy ,coronary artery disease , and status post vf arrest.pulmonary: the patient was initially intubated in the ccu forairway protection. he was rapidly weaned on the sedation. hewas successfully extubated on 1/28/03 . however , his chest x-raywas complicated by left lower lobe infiltrate , which wasconcerning for pneumonia. he ultimately has sputum culture thatgrew out pseudomonas and he has been treated with a 14-day coursefor pseudomonal pneumonia. please see id section below for moredetails.infectious disease: the patient with hypotension and question ofsepsis , septic physiology on 1/28/03 . he was started on empiriclevofloxacin and flagyl for question aspiration pneumonia bychest x-ray. he was also given one dose of gentamicin and thencovered his broad into ceftaz , vanc , levo , and flagyl whileawaiting results. he ultimately had no growth from any bloodcultures , although did have on sputum culture positive forpseudomonas which was sensitive to ceftazidime , but resistant tolevofloxacin. he was ultimately switched over to single agentceftazidime for a total of 14-day course for pseudomonalpneumonia/bronchitis.renal: the patient has chronic renal insufficiency with abaseline creatinine of 1.6 and 2.0. in the intensive care unit ,he had a rise of his creatinine up to a peak of 2.8. at the timeof discharge , he still has slightly elevated creatinine at 2.2 ,although it seems to be normalizing. it is likely that this iscontributed by his dilaudid received at the time ofcatheterization.heme: the patient anticoagulated at home with coumadin and thenduring his hospitalization with unfractionated heparin for hisbjork-shiley valve with a goal ptt of 60 to 80. at the time ofdischarge , he is being recoumadinized with a goal inr of 2.5 to3.5. previously , his home dose of coumadin had been 2 mg p.o.q.d. he will need to have his heparin dripped to 10 unitstherapeutically with ptt 60 to 80 until his inr is therapeutic oncoumadin. hematology continued the patient also with amacrocytic anemia , currently on folate therapy. at the time ofdischarge , his labs were pending for a b12 level , methylmalonicacid , and homocysteine did need to be followed up while thepatient is at rehab.endocrine: the patient with diabetes. he was continued on nphwith a regular insulin sliding scale with good control of hissugars. at the time of discharge , he should remain on his nphwith sliding scale coverage.fen: the patient was placed on ada diet and his electrolytes wererepleted p.r.n.prophylaxis: the patient on therapeutic anticoagulation. he wasalso placed on a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic gerd.tubes , lines , and drains: the patient had an ng tube for a shorttime during his intensive care unit stay while was intubated forenteral feeding. this was subsequently removed and the patienthas been able to take adequate p.o. intake. however , he has adual lumen peripherally inserted central catheter placed in hisright antecubital fossa on 3/9/03 for intravenous access for ivheparin as well as to continue his 14-day course of ceftazidime.pertinent labs at the time of discharge include a bun of 53 ,creatinine of 2.2 , white blood cell count of 11.4 with 73% polys ,20% lymphocytes , 6% monos , 2% eosinophils , and 1% basophils.hematocrit of 33.3 , which is stable , platelets of 175. his mcvwas 96.8 and his rdw was 18.0. his last ptt was 66.1 and inr was1.3.medications at the time of discharge:1. the patient is continued on his amiodarone load 400 mg p.o.t.i.d. x 3 days , last day of this dosing scheduled 4/3/03 ; andthe patient is to be switched to 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. x 7 days ,last day of this dose to be 4/30/03 ; and the patient to beswitched to amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. , starting on 2/26/03 andis to remain on this dose indefinitely.2. enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.3. ceftazidime 2 g iv q.12h. x 14 days , last dose on 10/6/03 .4. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.5. folate 1 mg p.o. q.d.6. lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d. this is the patient's new baselinediuretic regimen.7. heparin gtt infusion , current rate 900 units per hour ,continuous. this should be adjusted to achieve a goal ptt of 60to 80.8. nph insulin 15 units subcu q.a.m. , 10 units subcu q.p.m. thepatient also has regular insulin sliding scale subcu q.a.c. andh.s. scale. if blood sugar less than 200 , give 0 units.
