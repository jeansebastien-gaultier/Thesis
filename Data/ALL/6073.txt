continuous eeg recording: began at 12:05 on [3-18]and continued until 7:o0 the next morning. at the beginning, itshowed a low voltage faster pattern in all areas with bursts offocal slowing especially in the left temporal region. there werealso some runs of rhythmic 6 hz slowing in the left temporalarea and other runs of periodic slowing with sharp features,none lasting for more than 8-10 seconds or so. on video, theydid not appear to have any clinical correlate. by theevening, the background was more suppressed and, while lefttemporalslowing was still evident, the sharp features were not. spikedetection programs: showed a few of the left temporal sharpfeatures, especially early in the record. seizure detectionprograms: showed no electrographic seizures. pushbuttonactivations: there were none. sleep: no normal waking or sleeppatterns were evident. cardiac monitor: showed a generallyregular rhythm. impression: this telemetry captured nopushbutton activations. there was continued focal slowing in theleft temporal region. early in the record, this also includedsome runs of irregular sharp activity and some 6 hz rhythmicslowing in the same area, but these episodes did not appear toshow any clinical evidence of seizure on video. they were brief.no more prolonged and clear electrographic seizures wererecorded.cxr [2118-3-18]: portable ap chest radiograph demonstrates low lungvolumes and worsening basilar atelectasis. the left picc hasbeen removed. there is no focal consolidation, large pleuraleffusion, or pneumothorax. thecardiomediastinal silhouette is partially obscured.mr head [2118-3-19]: findings: the study is compared with mostrecent enhanced mr examination of [2-/2118], as well as the remotestudy of [2109-9-11].again demonstrated is the extensive confluentt2-/flair-hyperintensitythroughout bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular whitematter, with similar abnormality involving the posterior fossa,including the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and cerebellarhemispheres. allowing for the motion artifact, above, theoverall appearance is unchanged. by and in-large, the extensivelesions demonstrate intrinsic t1-hypointensity, representing"black holes" of irreversible demyelination. however, there is aprominent curvilinear or "targetoid" 16 mm focus of enhancementin the right corona radiata with a possible second enhancingfocus in the corresponding location on the left. the right-sidedfocus appears new since the [4-/2117] examination, thoughpreviously, there was a smaller, more nodular focus in theimmediately adjacent centrum semiovale. allowing for the markedlimitation in the post-contrast imaging, no other definiteenhancing focus is seen, with apparent interval resolution ofthe left-sided subcortical white matter, temporal lobar andcerebellar hemispheric foci. currently, there is no pathologicleptomeningeal or dural focus of enhancement.  there is nodefinite focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemicevent, and the principal intracranial vascular flow-voids,including those of the dural venous sinuses are preserved andthese structures enhance normally.  in comparison to the moreremote study there is no definite progression of the markedglobal atrophy (particularly given the patient's age) or thesevere diffuse atrophy of the corpus callosum. limited imagingof the upper cervical spinal cord, through the mid-c4 level,demonstrates no definite abnormality.impression: the study, particularly the post-contrast mp-rageacquisition, is quite limited by motion artifact, with:1. no significant change in the overall extensive demyelinating"diseaseburden." 2. curvilinear rim-enhancing focus in the right coronaradiata appears new since the [2117-4-6] study and likelyrepresents a site of active inflammation; allowing for thelimitation above, there is no definite additional enhancingfocus, with apparent interval resolution of many of the focidemonstrated on that study. 3. marked global and corpus callosalatrophy, not significantly changed since the [9-/2109] study.cxr [2118-3-25]: : a right-sided picc terminates within the distalsvc. the aeration of the lungs has

[known lastname 45855] is a 44yom with h/o multiple sclerosis, baselinecognitive defects, chronic indwelling suprapubic catheter andrecurrent resistant urinary tract infections presenting with auti and new onset seizures..after initially being admitted to the floor, he developedseizures requiring 10mg iv ativan and started on fosphenytoinwith a load and transferred to the micu.  he was noted to beincreasingly somnelent with periods of central apenea.  abgshowed acidemia with co2 on the 70s.  he was started on bipapwith improvement in his co2.  it was presumed that his centralapnea was secondary to his large ativan dose which slowlyimproved with clearance of the ativan.  he was startedemperically on vanc/ctx/amp/acyclivir to cover both his uti andfor empiric coverage for meningitis given his ams. a head mriwas done, which showed unchanged appearance of extensivedemyelinated, w/ new curvilinear rim focus in corona radiatia,likely site of active inflammation, no evidence of ischemicevent, unchanged marked global atrophy. given that meningitiswas less likely he was narrowed to vanc/[known lastname ].  he began towake up over the day on [3-19] and was weaned off bipap to ashovel mask and transferred to the floor..on the floor, he remained stable throughout the day on [3-20].however, that morning was noted to be more tachycardic andfebrile to 103 in the setting of hypoxia to the 80s.  he was puton a nrb and sats remained in the 80s for a while beforeimproving to the mid- 90s.  abg on nrb was 7.48/40/72.  his eyeswere open but wasn't following commands and appeared obtunded onthe floor. cxr on the floor showed no new infiltrate.  patientwas transitioned to the micu and briefly broadened tovanco/[month/year (2) ]/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, but quicklynarrowed given rapid improvement of respiratory status.  bymorning patient was alert and oriented x3, communicating andbreathing comfortably on 2l nasal cannula with saturation in midto high 90s.  abx were again narrowed to [month/year (2) 21347]/vanco forcoverage of uti. patient was then called out to floor..#) seizures (new): several possible etiologies in this patient;he has severe

w/antibiotics. there was a question of home aids flushing hisfoley, thus potentially introducing pathogens. there should beno flushing of the foley and this was addressed w/ wife and inpage 1 instructions..#) rash w/ vancomycin: pt did develop red rash on arms and facew/ vancomycin infusion. component of redman syndrome wassuspected. benedaryl was given w/ vancomycin and this improvedhis symptoms. there was no other evidence of allergic disease,and no facial swelling or airway obstruction..#) thrombocytopenia- bseline ~150's, went downt to 89 thisadmission. no signs of active bleeding. no rashes on exam. hehad been exposed to heparin in the last 30 days, so pf4 antibodywas checked and was negative. his platelets responded tobaseline by discharge, and likely this was all secondary toacute infection..#) multiple sclerosis: initially held home home baclofen givenams, but restarted by discharge once mental status improved..#) htn: continued home amlodipine.# code:
