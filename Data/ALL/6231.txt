she underwent diagnostic laparoscoy, convertedto open total abdominal hysterectomy, left salpingoopherectomy,pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, andcystoscopy.  procedure was converted due to difficulty accessingthe lymph nodes.  please see dr.[name (ni) 27357] operative note forfull details.postoperatively, the patient received a tap block for pain inthe pacu.  she developed tachycardia to 130s.  preoperatively,the patient had been tachycardic to 110s.   the patient hadreceived 6l iv fluids and maintained good uop.  she alsoreceived 13mg iv morphine and rr went down to 8.   arterialblood gas demonstrated hypercarbia with pco2 to 59.  nopre-operative hct was drawn, but the post-op hct was 27.5.  her02 sat was 82% on ra and up to mid 90s on cpap.  the decisionwas made to transfer the patient to the [hospital ward name 332] icu for furthermanagement.  on arrival to the icu the patient's 02 sat 99% on2l, she was alert, oriented and rr 15, not complaining of anypain.  she had a one-night [hospital unit name 153] stay.the following were addressed during the [hospital unit name 153] stay:1) hypoxia:her hypoxia was likely multifactorial, associated withatelectasis and low rr in the setting of a high morphine dose.the cxr was consistent with atelectasis.  patient also noted tohave some snoring and full neck likely associated with somedegree of sleep apnea.  she was ruled out for pulmonary embolismwith ct-a. the ct did suggest possible aspiration versusinfectious etiology with "scattered bilateralperibronchovascular opacities."  at the time of [hospital unit name 153] call-out,the patient was saturating 98% on 2l oxygen by nasal canula,which was stable from her presentation to the icu, mildlyimproved.2) sinus tachycardia:her sinus tachycardia was of unclear etiology, though clearlydocumented prior to going to the or.  the patient clearly deniedpain, anxiety; her post-op pain was controlled with dilaudidpca.  she did describe some difficulty with bowel prep thatcould have caused dehydration, but the tachycardia did notresolve with 6l ivfs despite orbital edema.  her post-operativefever could have been contributing to the tachycardia as well.telemetry was discontinued upon transfer to the gyn oncologyservice.3) fever:the patient spiked a fever to 102.5 the evening of pod#0.  ctawas suggestive of possible aspiration pneumonia as an etiology.4) anemia:hematocrit at time of transfer to the [hospital unit name 153] was 24.  she wastransfused 1 unit of prbcs in the icu in addition to 2 units ofprbcs she had received intraoperatively in the pacu.the patient was transferred to the gyn oncology service onpod#1.  the remainder of her hospital stay was notable for thefollowing:1) apiration pneumonia:the patient was successfully weaned to room air on gyn oncologyservice.  given that her temperature was still elevated to 101.2at the time of transfer, she was started on iv clindamycinempirically for treatment of aspiration pneumonia.  urineculture was negative, and blood cultures were still pending atthe time of hospital discharge.  following initiation ofclindamycin, she remained afebrile for over 24 hours.  she thenrespiked to a low grade temperature of 100.6.  urinalysis wasnegative.  cxr was repeated, demonstrating bibasilar opacitiesconcerning for ongoing aspiration pneumonia.  the patientspontaneously defervesced, and remained afebrile for theremainder of her hospital stay.  clindamycin was discontinuedand levofloxacin initiated.  the patient received 24 hours of ivlevofloxacin and was discharged home on po levofloxacin.  within24 hours of discharge, the patient called informing thatinsurance would not cover po levofloxacin.  she was switched toa 10 day course of augmentin and azithromycin.2) nausea/emesisthe patient experienced an episode of nausea with small amountof bilious emesis on pod#3.  diet was retracted from fullliquids back to npo with resolution of symptoms.  diet wassuccessfully advanced the following day.she was discharged home on pod#5 in good condition: tolerating aregular diet, ambulating and voiding without difficulty,afebrile, saturating well on room air.medications on admission:prilosecdischarge medications:1. levofloxacin 750 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po once a dayfor 10 days.disp:10 tablet(s) refills:02. omeprazole 20 mg capsule,
