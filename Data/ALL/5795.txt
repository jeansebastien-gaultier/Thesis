[known lastname 73078] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a past medicalhistory significant for mds with aml transformation on dacogen,diverticulosis, known cecal avms admitted from clinic on [2195-4-1]in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets withthrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood perrectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeatcolonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entirecolon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with argonplasma coagulation. she required a second colonoscopy forrepeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent tothe cecum. she remained stable for a while then had frequentbloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar dripfor 8 hours. gradually her platelets started to increase. afterthese events, she remained stable and was discharged home instable condition. she will require hla matched platelettransfusions in the future if needed..# cecal avms:  she was transferred to the icu twice for brightred blood per rectum. the patient developed brbpr, and was foundto have cecal avms on colonoscopy s/p apc. specifically, repeatcolonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were activelybleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp.hemostasis achieved with argon plasma coagulation therapy on[2195-4-3].  during her stay she required several units of prbc andplatelets. after remaining stable, she was transferred back tothe floor however she had the same situation again and wastransferred back to the icu where she had her second colonoscopywhich showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around theclot. the clot was not removed (not amenable to endoscopicmanagement). gi recommended surgical consult for possibleresection however given her underlying disease and low plateletcounts, they felt this will not be a favorable management. afterhaving stable h/h, she was transferred back to the floor. whileon the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however thenight of [4-17] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools whichrequired amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the40-50's). cta was negative. following this, she did not have anyfurther significant bloody stools. she remained vitally stablewith stable h/h and gradually rising platelet count..# thrombocytopenia: secondary to chemotherapy and mds/amlconcerns. concern for consumptive process following transfusionof platelets in the setting of possible itp vs. ttp howeverhematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was noevidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers. thepatient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets whenfirst admitted. she was premedicated with anti-histamines. whilethe patient was actively bleeding, she was also given amicar (2grams iv with 1gram/hour iv infusion overnight on [2195-4-2]). thiswas repeated over the night of [4-17] as above. she was found tohave a positive pra and required hla matched platelets for allsubsequent transfusions. her twin sister was tested at red crossfor potential candidate to donate platelets for her sisterhowever since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not asuitable option. of note, her platelet count was improvingalready and did not require further platelet transfusions.platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge..# transfusion reaction/pra positive: the patient had transfusionreaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once whileon the floor). she was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl,and hydrocortisone. a blood bank work up was initiated, and thepatient was given group specific platelets. she was found to bepra positive and requires hla matched platelets. however, duringher second episode of brbpr on [4-12], it was found that there wasno more hla matched platelets available in [location (un) 86] area. redcross was contact[name (ni) ] for more hla matched platelets. sister was apotential donor however it wasn't suitable given heranti-platelet therapy as above. she did not require furtherplatelet transfusions once her platelet count started toincrease..# mds with aml transformation:  while the patient was on thefloor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up andher neutrophil count was trending down.  it was then decided tostart her on second cycle of dacogen (day 1 = [2195-4-8]).  thepatient tolerated the dacogen well, with little side effects.12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge..# gerd: the patient was continued on her home ppi..# constipation:  the patient has a history of severeconstipation, however, her home medications were held in thesetting of her brbpr and then restarted upon discharge givenresolution of bloody bowel movements..transitional issues:- the patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a bloodbank work up was initiated and she was found to be pra positive;she will require hla matched platelets for all subsequenttransfusions.medications on admission:1. loratadine 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily ().2. omeprazole 20 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) sig: two (2)capsule, delayed release(e.c.) po daily (daily).3. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram powder in packet sig: one(1) powder in packet po qhs (once a day (at bedtime)).4. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 ml suspension sig: thirty (30)ml po qhs (once a day (at bedtime)).5. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po bid (2times a day).6. allopurinol 300 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po once a day.disp:30 tablet(s) refills:0discharge medications:1. loratadine 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po daily ().2. omeprazole 40 mg capsule, delayed release(e.c.) sig: one (1)capsule, delayed release(e.c.) po once a day.3. miralax 17 gram powder in packet sig: one (1)  po at bedtimeas needed for constipation.4. milk of magnesia 400 mg/5 ml suspension sig: thirty (30) mlpo at bedtime as needed for constipation.5. docusate sodium 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po twicea day.discharge disposition:homedischarge diagnosis:myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myloid leukemiacecal atriovenous malformationslower gi bleeddischarge condition:mental status: clear and coherent.level of consciousness: alert and interactive.activity status: ambulatory - independent.discharge instructions:dear ms. [known lastname 73078],it was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalizedat [hospital1 18].  you were admitted to the hospital because you had atransfusion reaction after getting platelets at clinic.  we didsome tests and found that you will need specially screenedplatelets from now on because your body reacts to normalplatelets.while you were here, you also developed some bleeding from yourrectum.  you were transferred to the intensive care unit andthey gastrointestinal doctors looked into your intestines with acamera and found some areas of bleeding called av malformationsthat were clipped. after this, you were sent to the floor thensent back to the icu when you had further bleeding. secondcolonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to yourcolon in the same area where the avm's were clipped. your bloodlevel was stable as well as your blood pressure and you weretransferred to the floor.while on the floor, you had a few loose bloody stools thatsubsequently resolved. your diet was gradually advanced and youtolerated it well prior to discharge. your platelets graduallyincreased and it was in the 80's on your discharge day.the surgeons evaluated you for possible surgical removal of partof your colon, however they felt it is unsafe to do surgery forthe moment. we did not discharge you on amicar which is a clotstabilizer medication since you did not have further bloodystools, your blood level was stable and your platelets weregradually increasing.we also noticed some changes in your blood work that made usthink that your leukemia was acting up again; because of that westarted you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy.  youtolerated the chemo well..while in the hosiptal, it was noted that occasionally your bloodpressure was high and you were started on a medication for brieftime. however, given your gi bleeds, this was held. we will notdischarge you at the moment with anti-hypertensive medication.we did the following changes in your medication list:- please stop allopurinolplease continue the rest of your home medications the same wayyou were taking them at home prior to admission.your picc line was removed prior to discharge.it will be important for you to follow up with dr.
