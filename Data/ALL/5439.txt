fracture and it was determined that his fracture resultedfrom an injury 20 years ago when he dove into a pool. onhospital day 6 he was triggered for altered mental status afterreceiving valium.  standing zyprexa was administered with returnto baseline mental status without further incidient.  herequires no further neurosurgical follow-up for his densfracture.cardiovascular: following transfer
