and had oxygen saturationsin the low 90s on a 60% venturi mask. chest imaging did not showany focal process but was concerning for either fluid overloador an inflammatory process. a bnp was ~200. he was initiallydiuresed for suspected chf exacerbation and started onlevo/flagyl (later ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl) forpossible pneumonia. he failed to improve on diuretics andantibiotics. an echo showed no evidence of significant systolicdysfunction (ef 50%). on the second day of hospitalizationsputem cultures showed pcp and he was started on iv bactrim andiv steroids. his oxygen

subsided and you were able to take food andmedicine effectively by mouth. you were then able to bedischarge to a rehabilitation facility to complete yourrecovery..the following changes were made to your medications:- please start taking bactrim ds 3tabs three times a day tocomplete a 21 day course started on [12-15] and ending on [1-5].you will likely need to remain on a lower dose of bactrim
