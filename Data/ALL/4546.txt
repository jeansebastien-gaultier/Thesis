the operating room on 02-12 , at which time she underwent anaortic valve replacement .please see the operative report for full details .in summary , she had an aortic valve replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve .she tolerated the operation well , and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit .the patient did well in the immediate postoperative period , however , her blood pressure remained somewhat labile .therefore , she was continued on a neo-synephrine drip to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110 .in addition , she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was reversed , and in several attempts to wean from the ventilator , she developed a respiratory acidosis .she therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of postoperative day one .on postoperative day two , the patient remained hemodynamically stable .her neo-synephrine drip was weaned to off .she was again weaned from the ventilator , and successfully extubated .her chest tubes were discontinued and , at the end of the day , she was transferred from the cardiothoracic intensive care unit to the floor for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation .after being transferred to the floor , the patient did well .over the next several days , her activity level was increased with the assistance of physical therapy and the nursing staff .she remained hemodynamically stable .her respiratory condition remained stable and , on postoperative day four , she was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physicaltherapy .at the time of transfer , the patient 's physical examination is as follows :vital signs :temperature 98.4 , heart rate 78 and sinus rhythm , blood pressure 106/50 , respiratory rate 18 , oxygen saturation 97% on room air .weight preoperatively was 67 kg , at discharge is 70.9 kg .laboratory data on 02-15 :white count 4.1 , hematocrit 23 ,
