[known lastname ] is a 76 year-old female with multiple medicalproblems including hbv, fatty liver, colonic mass s/p resection,htn, hyperlipidemia, who was initally admitted on [10-23]for increasing dyspnea over the six weeks prior to admission andincreased pleuritic chest pain on the right side.1) dyspnea: after admission, a cxr was done which showed a rightsided pleural effusion.  cta was also done to rule out apulmonary embolus.  this did not show a pe; however, showedseveral mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest precarinal,measuring 1.4 cm.  there was also right-sided pleural nodulardensities and several small nodules bilaterally, the largestlocated in the rll anterior to the pleural effusion, measuring~8mm.  right lung base atelectasis was present, with amoderate-sized pleural effusion.  no pe was seen, however.  thedifferential at that time was thought to beinflammatory/infectious, less likely vasculitis or neoplastic. afollow-up ct was recommended.  on [2197-10-25], thoracentesis of theright pleural effusion was performed by the interventionalpulmonology fellow and the pleural fluid obtained was consistentwith an exudative fluid with an elevated red count (trauma) andlymphocytsosis.  cultures of the fluid were negative, andcytology was negative for malignant cells.  the patient thendeveloped fevers to 101.7 with new wheezing and was thought tohave a pneumonia with a component of reactive airwaydisease/copd.  on [10-28], she was started onvancomycin/flagyl/levofloxacin (these were later discontinued on[11-11]).  she was also started on solumedrol and mdi's.  on[10-30], mrs. [known lastname ] then developed hypercarbic respiratory failureand was found to have stridor/wheezing on exam which did notimprove with racemic epi.  at this point, she was transferred tothe micu. in the micu, the patient was stabilized on bipap andnebulizers.  she was transferred back to the floor on [11-5].after a few days on the floor, the patient again developedincreasing dyspnea.  a cxr was performed which showed anincrease in the size of her right sided effusion.  on [11-9],another thoracentesis was attempted to take fluid off and makethe patient more comfortable; however, fluid could not beaspirated.  the patient's lung was imaged by the interventionalpulmonology (ip) fellow with us and thick fluid vs. consildationvs. lung parenchyma was obseved. the ip fellow suggested that act scan be performed for better characterization of the effusionseen on cxr, as well as vats to obtain tissue at the pleuralnodule for a diagnosis.  the patient could not lie supine due tosignificant respiratory distress, so she was transferred back tothe micu for elective intubtaion to obtain ct scan andsubsequent vats.  the repeat chest ct on [11-10] showed anincreased right sided collection with worsening atelactasis ofright middle lobe and right lower lobe. there was also increasednodular thickening of right upper lobe.  on [2197-11-10], dr. [last name (stitle) 175](thoracic surgery) performed a vats and pleural biopsy.  twochest tubes were placed during the surgery for drainage of hereffusion.  the effusion was loculated, so thoracic surgery usedtpa to break up fibrinous locuations.   mrs. [known lastname ] did wellpost-op with only minor pain at the incision site.  this wascontrolled with morphine.  on [11-12], the patient was trasferredback to the floor.  she was maintained on nebulizers forrespiratory comfort and morphine for pain control.  on [11-15], thepathology from her pleural biopsy obtained during vats revealeda metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  immunostains werepositive for cea, cytokeratin, and s100, but negative formart-1, ttf-1, b72.3, and calretinin.  the patient was notifiedof the results and she reported that she did not want anychemotherapy.  after agreement by the patient, medical oncologywas consulted to review her case and present the possibleoptions to her before she made this decision final.  afterseeing oncology, the patient still held to not wantedchemotherapy.  she said that she wanted to go home to [state 3914]with her son, who is a retired nurse.  her son decided that hewould care for her in his home.  he arranged to have hospitalbed sent to his home, and arranged to have physician who willvisit mrs. [known lastname ] at home.  an ambulance was arranged totransport the patient from [location (un) 86] to [state 3914].2. pneumonia: the patient had a cxr done on [10-27] which showed anodular density right mid zone.  given her fragile respiratorystatus, this was treated as pneumonia withlevo/flagyl/vancomycin.  the antibiotic course was continuedfrom [10-28] until [11-11].3. non-st elevation mi: during her admission, the patient hadepisodes of chest pain.  at one point, her cardiac enzymestrended up to a high of trop = 0.32.  ekg was without changes.these cardiac enzymes subsequently trended down.  other episodesof chest pain on this admission were not accompanied by ekgchanges or elevation of cardiac enzymes.4.  acute renal failure: during her admission, the patient hadarf with a high creatinine of 3.6.  the was likely of prerenaletiology given her urine lytes at the time.  with iv hydration,her creatinine trended down, and on discharge was 0.55.  anemia: the patient had a low hct throughout her admission(low 30's to high 20's).  her stools were guaiac negative. shewas transfused to maintain hct<30.8.  abdominal pain: mrs. [known lastname ] periodically complained ruq andepigastric abdominal pain throughout her admission.  two ruqultrasounds were obtained which were normal without evidence ofcholelithiasis or cholecystits.  her lfts and amylase/lipasealso remained within normal limits.  her abdominal pain wasthought to be due to peptic ulcer disease.  she was maintainedon her ppi.9.  diarrhea: she also complained of diarrhea towards the end ofher hospital course.  she was tested for c. diff, which wasnegative x 3.  her diarrhea was likely a side effect of herantibiotics.10. htn: the patient was maintained on her outpatient regimenfor htn.11. prophylaxis:  she was maintained on pneumoboots, sc heparin,bowel regimen, and ppi.12. code status: throughout her hospital admission, the patientwas full code.  after she was given the diagnosis of nscc, thisissue was re-addressed.  after a discussion with the patient andher son, she made the decision to change her status to dnr/dniand maintained that status on discharge from the hospital.medications on admission:hctz 25 qdpantoprazole 40 qdpaxil 12.5 qdsenna prnasa 81 qd[doctor first name ] 60 prnca + vit dmviall: shellfishdischarge medications:1. paroxetine hcl 10 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po qd ().disp:30 tablet(s) refills:22. zolpidem tartrate 5 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po hs (atbedtime).disp:30 tablet(s) refills:03. camphor-menthol 0.5-0.5 % lotion sig: one (1) appl topicalqid (4 times a day) as needed.disp:1 bottle refills:04. salmeterol xinafoate 50 mcg/dose disk with device sig: one(1) inh inhalation q12h (every 12 hours).disp:60 inh refills:05. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % solution sig: one (1) inhinhalation q4h (every 4 hours): with albuterol nebs.disp:180 inh refills:06. sodium chloride 0.65 % aerosol, spray sig: [1-13] sprays nasaltid (3 times a day) as needed.disp:1 bottle refills:07. metoprolol tartrate 25 mg tablet sig: 0.5 tablet po tid (3times a day).disp:45 tablet(s) refills:08. isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg tablet sig: two (2) tablet po tid(3 times a day).disp:180 tablet(s) refills:09. albuterol sulfate 0.083 % solution sig: one (1) inhinhalation q3h (every 3 hours): [month (only) 116] use more frequently ifnecessary.disp:240 inh refills:010. multivitamin     capsule sig: one (1) cap po qd ().disp:30 cap(s) refills:011. bisacodyl 5 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.) sig: two (2)tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po daily (daily) as needed forconstipation.disp:60 tablet, delayed release (e.c.)(s) refills:012. bismuth subsalicylate 262 mg/15 ml suspension sig: fifteen(15) ml po tid (3 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.disp:1 bottle refills:013. ibuprofen 400 mg tablet sig: one (1) tablet po q8h (every 8hours) as needed.disp:90 tablet(s) refills:014. pantoprazole sodium 40 mg tablet, delayed release (e.c.)sig: one (1) tablet, delayed release (e.c.) po q12h (every 12hours).disp:60 tablet, delayed release (e.c.)(s) refills:015. guaifenesin 100 mg/5 ml syrup sig: 5-10 mls po q6h (every 6hours) as needed.disp:1 bottle refills:016. phenergan 25 mg/ml solution sig: twenty five (25) mginjection q4-6h:prn as needed for nausea.disp:1 box refills:017. morphine sulfate 2 mg/ml syringe sig: 1-2 mg injectionq2h:prn as needed for pain.disp:40 mg refills:018. roxanol concentrate 20 mg/ml solution sig: 10-30 mg poq4h:prn as needed for pain.disp:600 mg refills:019. ativan 2 mg/ml syringe sig: 0.5-1 mg injection q4-6h:prn asneeded.disp:20 ml refills:020. ativan 0.5 mg tablet sig: 0.5-1 mg po q4-6h:prn.disp:30 tablets refills:021. colace 100 mg capsule sig: one (1) capsule po once a day.disp:30 capsule(s) refills:022. senna 8.6 mg capsule sig: two (2) capsule po bid:prn asneeded for constipation.disp:60 capsule(s) refills:023. dulcolax 10 mg suppository sig: ten (10) mg rectal qd:prn asneeded for constipation.disp:30 tablets refills:024. equipmentplease dispense (1)three in one commodedischarge disposition:home with servicefacility:visiting nurse  and hospicedischarge diagnosis:1) metastatic non-small cell carcinoma2) right pleural effusiondischarge condition:stabledischarge instructions:please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if youexperience difficulty breathing, chest pain, or fever/chills.followup instructions:please follow up with your new doctor, dr.
