etoposode, ivig and decadron on~[11-7].  his pancytopenia was also treated with epogen andneupogen..per heme, hlh likely triggered by underlying ebv infection.while there was evidence of ebv in the csf; because of normalprotein no need for it-mtx.  the patient was started on asteroid taper (currently on 10 mg decadron) and will need 8weeks total of etoposide.  renal failure,

klebsiella in a sputum andbal sample, and was begun on meropenem for 14 day course. hecontinued to develop low grade temperature (100.0-100.6), whichwere attributed to his hlh, ivig, and cvvhd..#  respiratory failure: pt intubated on [2118-10-30] for impendingrespiratory distress at time of his ercp.  upon admission to the[hospital unit name 153] on [11-7], his respiratory mechanics had improvedconsiderably, and he was oxygenating and ventilating well on ps5/0.  initially unable to extubate secondary to altered mentalstatus and increased secretions.  pt was often desyncrhonous onvent secondary to hiccups when sedation weaned.  as mentalstatus improved gradually, pt was extubated on [11-10].   hisrespiratory status continued to improve slowly, despite +bal forebsl klebsiella and

mechanical ventilation, breif neuro exam at time of [hospital unit name 153]admission with sedation weaned revealed pt responsive only todeep painful stimulus (sternal rub),  pupils minimally reactiveto light bilaterally, gag was present, with slow corneal reflex. +hyperreflexia, though tone was flacid, and 5-10 beat clonus ofboth feet was noted which initially worsened to 20 beat clonuson

lfts (tbil 7's), forwhich he underwent ercp with cbd stent on [11-2].  lfts havesince trended down, though amylase/lipase (peak in 1000s) werestarting to plateau at 500s on [11-14].  ct abdomen showedpancreatic fluid collection, but not psuedocyst or necrosis.  on[11-13] pt denied abdominal pain, and was hungry, thus wastransitioned from tpn to tf cautiously, as prior attempt torestart tube feeds was limited by bump in amylase/lipase.  on[11-14], pt was tolerating tf without difficulty, in addition tosips of clear liquids, thus he was advanced to a regular dietafter a speech & consult
