pathology unknown , remote seizure disorder , migraines ,goiter status post left partial thyroidectomy preoperative for aright thyroidectomy after her coronary artery bypass grafting.she is status post a partial oophorectomy and as stated abovecraniotomy for tumor resection in 1973 and status post leftpartial thyroidectomy and right breast biopsy.allergies: the patient has allergies to penicillin where shedevelops hives.medications on admission: atenolol 100 mg daily , aspirin 81 mgdaily , simvastatin 40 mg daily , vitamin c one tab daily , woman'swellness natural hormone balance two tablets a day and pepcid-acone tab as needed.physical examination: five feet six inches , 145.44 kg ,temperature 98.6 , heart rate 70 and regular , blood pressure rightarm 140/70 , left arm 146/74. oxygen saturation 96% on room air.cardiovascular , regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs orheaves. peripheral vascular 2+ pulses bilaterally in thecarotid , radial , femoral pulses 1+ bilaterally in the dorsalispedis and posterior tibialis pulses. respiratory , breath soundsclear bilaterally , is otherwise noncontributory.admission labs: sodium 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride of 103 , co229 , bun of 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 205 , magnesium 1.9 , andbnp is 62 , wbc 7.51 , hematocrit 38.4 , hemoglobin 12.4 , plateletsof 312 , pt 14.9 , pt/inr of 1.2 , and ptt of 26.3.hospital course: the patient underwent left carotid artery stentplacement on 2/3/06. coronary artery bypass grafting wascanceled due to the high-grade carotid stenosis. operativereport is not available at this time. postoperatively , the patient haddeveloped diplopia and a distant visual disturbance. ct of thehead was negative for any acute event. neurologically , the patient's mentalstatus was intact , alert , oriented. the patient's neurologicsymptoms improved and she was transferred to the step-down uniton 0/14/2006 and was cleared for discharge to home on 7/0/06.mrs. michand will follow up with the vascular surgeon , dr.ziff , in two weeks and dr. liebermann will perform her coronary artery bypassgraft in four weeks. she is discharged to home in stable condition.discharge medications: plavix 75 mg , enteric-coated aspirin 325mg a day , motrin 400-800 mg q.6 h. p.r.n. pain , toprol-xl 100 mgdaily , simvastatin 40 mg nightly.discharge labs: glucose 101 , bun of 11 , creatinine 1 , sodium139 , potassium 4.4 , chloride of 102 , co2 28 , magnesium 1.9 , wbcis 7.07 , hemoglobin 11 , hematocrit 33.3 , platelets of 274.disposition: ms. hartwigsen will be discharged to home instable condition , will follow up with dr. nathan mascot for hercoronary artery bypass grafting next month and dr. sandra asstated above in two weeks for her postoperative left carotidartery stent placement.escription document: 1-4562294 cssten teldictated by: tacker , mohamedattending: pinell , felixdictation id 2510019d: 5/5/06t: 1/16/06[report_end]
