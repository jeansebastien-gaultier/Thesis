admission date :2019-03-29discharge date :2019-04-01service :neurologyhistory of present illness :the patient is a 83 yo r-handed man with a history of multiple intracranial hemorrhages during the last few years , pacemaker , hyperlipidemia , arrhythmia who now presents with gradual decline in gait and slowing of mentation over the last week .the patient had a fall about ten days ago , when he was walking the dog .the leash got wrapped around his legs .according to his wife he had a small abrasion on the top of his head , but nothing major .he did not complain about a headache .he was at baseline with respect to his gait ( at baseline unsteady , though he refuses to walk with a walker ) and his mentation ( at baseline difficulties with memory since months ; keeps forgetting appointments ).then about a week ago , the patient and his wife noted that his gait became even more unsteady , though he did not fall .he also had difficulties navigating through his apartment , having difficulties finding the fridge for example .they were concerned that the fall might have caused another bleed , as had happened in the past , and this prompted them to come to the deanna .no headache , neckpain , nausea , vomiting or focal weakness / numbness .review of systems : denies any fever , chills , weight loss , visual changes , hearing changes , dysphagia , tingling , numbness , bowel-bladder dysfunction , chest pain , shortness of breath , abdominal pain , dysuria , hematuria , or bright red blood per rectum .his legs have been feeling weaker , bilaterally since the last week .brief hospital course :the patient is a 83 yo man with a history of past intracranial hemorrhages ( most recent 07-01 with r-frontal hemorrhage ) who presented with gradually slowing of mentation and increased gait instability since one week .on initial exam the patient was not oriented to time , seemed somewhat slow , and had difficulties generating a list of animals .his cranial nerves and strength were full , and the sensory exam showed mildly decreased vibration and proprioception in both le , suggesting peripheral neuropathy .a ct was performed in the deanna that showed a new significant r-frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the same location as the prior bleed .the patient was seen by both neurology and neurosurgery , and the two teams agreed that the etiology seemed to be related to underlying amyloidosis .during the last admission the question of a mass underlying a hemorrhage in the r-frontal region was raised .the location of the hemorrhage was not felt to be typical for hypertensive bleed ( cortical ) and it was felt to be unlikely that the recent fall was related to the bleed .the patient could not undergo an mri due to his pacer .he was admitted to the neurology icu for closer monitoring and was stable overnight - bp was initially elevated and required a labetalol drip for < 24 hours , then stabilized .the goal sbp of < 150 was achieved .coags and ua were checked and were normal .for the question of seizure activity associated with a cortical bleed , he was started prophylactically on keppra ( given questionable allergy to dilantin ) , at 500 mg bid ; no seizure activity was seen .this medication should be continued as an outpatient at least while the bleed has time to clear up , with planned titration up to 1000 mg bid on 04-05 .head ct repeated on 03-30 was unchanged , and the patient remained stable with only very suble focal exam findings ( very mild right pronator drift ) as well as his persistently poor memory related to dementia .the plan after 24 hours was to transfer him to the floor , but the hospital was full and he never got a bed .cardiovascularly , lipitor and amiodarone were continued .he could not get an mri due to his pacemaker .there were no telemetry events , and he ruled out by enzyme .pulmonlologically , his chest xray was negative and he complained of no breathing problems .endocrinologically , bg was monitored to improve outcome in icu setting though he had no history of dm .of note , hba1c done 03-04 was slightly elevated ( " borderline dm " ) at 6.3 ; this was repeated and was still pending on the day of discharge .ins / outs and electrolytes were monitored and were not abnormal ; he was on a bowel regimen , vd boots and pud prophylaxis with protonix during the admission .walking was assessed later and the patient was unstable on his feet .pt was asked to see him for this gait problem .brandon felt well and was seen by pt who suggested a rehab/hahnemann hospital ( worcester ) to work on walking with the eventual goal of returning to assisted living with his wife when walking improved .follow-up was arranged with neurosurgery in 5-6 weeks with repeat head ct to be arranged by neurosurgery office to make sure blood has cleared , and if indicated , to look for a possible underlying lesion ( although unlikely ) .
