[first name4 (namepattern1) ] [known firstname ]..2. cad/[name (ni) 102410] pt had a nstemi on [10-21] which was felt to bemost probably due to demand but acute coronary syndrome couldnot be absolutely excluded. he was on heparin for 5 days and wasd/c'ed in setting of left subconjunctival hemorrhage. since ptis just recovering from his copd exacerbation, we felt that itwould be safer to defer cardiac cath as an outpatient. pt agreedwith this plan and stated his wish not to be cath'ed during thisadmission. cardiology was okay with this plan and they plan tore-evaluate him in 4 weeks. in the meantime, pt was continued onwith medical management. he was continued on diltiazem for ratecontrol (beta blocker not used in order to avoid it'sbronchospastic effects). however, diltiazem was unable to betitrated up secondary to blood pressure intolerance; pt's hrremained in 90-110 range. pt was continued on captopril, butmost doses were held secondary to blood pressure intolerance.for now, we will discontinue acei; please add it back on astolerated. pt was continued on aspirin and statin..3. severe aortic stenosis- pt found to have severe aorticstenosis on echo during this admission. the plan to be havecardiac cath as an outpatient after pulmonary rehab for a formalassessment of the aortic valve. we avoided beta blocker andnitoglycerin..4. steroid induced diabetes mellitus- pt was continued on nphand sliding scale. oral [doctor last name 360] glipizide was added. pt is onmetformin as an outpatient, but we did not restart that since ptmay be at increased risk for lactic acidosis in the setting ofhypoxia or cardiac ischemia. please continue to titrate upglipizide and adjust nph as indicated..5. [name (ni) 12329] pt had a difficult time tolerating diltiazem and aceigiven his low blood pressures ranging from 90-100 systolic. wewill continue diltiazem for rate control and hold acei for now.please titrate up dilt for better rate control. if bp tolerates,can consider restarting acei.6. subconjunctival hemorrhage- occurred in setting of iv heparinand noninvasive positive pressure. there was slow resolution ofthe hemorrhage. pt was continued on erythromycin ointment qid.ophtho stated that it may take 2 weeks for the hemorrhage toresolve. after then, pt should be safe for elective cardiaccath. should anti-coagulation be urgently indicated prior toresolution of hemorrhage, ophtho feels the hemorrhage should notbe an absolute contraindication. pt will f/u with [hospital ] clinicone week after discharge..7.
