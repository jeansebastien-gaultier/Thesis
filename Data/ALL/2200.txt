19 st. jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .this was performed by dr. medicine and dr. room .the patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .she was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .on 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a ct scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .there was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .on 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .however , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .she was begun on a heparin drip .on 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .she underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .she was taken postoperatively the icu where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .she was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .she was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .she was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .disposition :she is transferred to rockdempbanri hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .discharge medications :lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; timoptic solution 0.5% os b.i.d. ; coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient 's prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 iu .dictated by :nieie freierm , m.d. zx 681 / 0201 / rishan mishon room , m.d.breuntikd :05/26/92t :05/27/92batch :u886report :lh486l9
