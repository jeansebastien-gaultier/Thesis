progressive shortness ofbreath and doe over past 2 weeks admitted to the micu withpleural effusions and a pericardial effusion in the setting ofpresumed viral pleurisy and pericarditis that developed into aneffusion after chronic nsaid use possible aspiration/cap pna whodeveloped afib with rvr secondary to pain and pericardialeffusion, transaminitis with cholestasis and acute renal failurein the setting of anemia and nsaid use who has a persistent o2requirement with pleuritic pain and resolving pericardialeffusion.  she improved clinically prior to discharge after ctplacement for her l effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her rsided pleural effusion..# sob/cp/hypoxia: likely multifactorial with most obviousetiologies being pleural, pericardial effusions, and . pe wasless likely given [5-23] cta negative. due to her effusions, it wasthought she may have an underlying pna and she was started onlevaquin for cap.  she was given a prolonged course due toconcern that she may have had infection in her pericardialfluid.  the day after admission ([6-7]) she was intubated forhemodynamic control(afib rvr 150s), pain control, and forpotential procedure for a possible pericardial window.  from arespiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubationwhich was done under rapid sequence given signs of earlytamponade.  she was extubated without event when it wasdetermined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusionneeded to be drained.  instead, cardiology recommended serialecho's to follow the effusions size.  an echo on [6-14] showedthat the effusion was reduced in size compared to prior imaging..#afib with rvr: the patient has a history of lone atrialfibrillation. on day of admission patient went to afib to 200sbriefly sustaining in the 160s.  this was thought [2-23] to painand infection vs tamponade physiology.  she received metroprololiv and dilt drip. when patient was intubated, she converted backto sinus rhythm and maintained in sinus rhythm.  afterextubation and while on the floor the patient did not have anypalpitations or further episodes of afib wtih rvr.- she will need to discuss with her outpatient physician[name9 (pre) ] with aspirin when her pericardial effusionresolves..# pleural effusions: she presented with pleuritic chest painwhich was initially attributed to her pleural effusions.initially, the ddx was broad including infectious(lyme/parvonegative, [location (un) ] pending), malignant(cytology ultimatelynegative), and rheumatologic([doctor first name ] negative and c3/c4 normal). chfand cirrhosis unlikely based on h+p. lipase normal makespancreatits unlikely. thoracentesis reveals exudate, likelyparapneumonic given fevers, and a viral pleuritis was alsoconsidered.  id was consulted who recommended empiric coveragefor cap with a prolonged course of levofloxacin (14 days -finish on [6-20]) due to a concern that the pericardial fluidcould [hospital1 ] infection.  cytology negative, cultures negative.morphine and fentanyl pleuritic cp. the most likely diagnosiswas a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial processpossibly in the setting of aspiration 1 week prior.  of note hereffusions persisted despite antibiotic therapy and nsaidtherapy.  she was given diuretics with lasix which did notreduced the size of her effusion.  therefore, a l sided chesttube placement by ip in addition to a right sided thoracentesis. after subsequent removal of her bilateral pleural effusions,her symptoms of sob and o2 requirement resolved..# pericardial effusion: initially echo concerning for early butnot overt tamponade physiology and exam was concerning. patientwas given ivf to maintain preload. serologies were sent asabove. her pulsus was monitored closely and was never above12mmhg. cardiology consult followed closely and serial echosshowed improvement in effusions. the decision was made not todrain effusions for diagnostic purposes given the risksinvolved.  she was restarted on nsaid therapy for viralpericarditis.  of note, her effusion improved by echo prior todischarge..# cap:  given her exudative effusion and viral pleuritis therewas concern for cap and possible aspiration.  she was given atwo week course of levofloxacin to finish on the date listedabove..# diarrhea:  she had transient episode of diarrhea while onantibiotics, and her diarrhea resolved..# [last name (un) ]/low uo: dark urine and poor output early in icu course.thought potentially from nsaids. renal spun urine and it was notactive.  she had low uop, which improved with ivf..cholestasis and hepatitis:  she was noted to have to haveabnormal lft's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic rsided abdominal pain.  there was concern that she could haveeither a viral induced hepatitis with cholestasis versus acongestive hepatopathy in the setting of mild volume overload.cholecystitis was less likely given the absence of a whitecount.  her lft's trended down independent of diuresis therebysuggesting/confirming a possible viral etiology for herhepatitis and cholestasis.  of note her hepatitis serologieswere negative..# anemia: baseline hct 40s most recently in [2171]. no signs orsymptoms of bleeding. likely from systemic process going on.normal colonoscopy in [2171]. of note, she is currentlymenopausal, and has iron studies that suggest she has anemia ofchronic disease, or at least anemia with acute inflammation.- she will need a cbc as an outpatient.medications on admission:-aspirin tab 81mg ec (aspirin) 1 qddischarge medications:1.
