[known lastname ] is an 81 yo m withrheumatic heart disease (c/b aortic stenosis s/p recent [known lastname 1291]/mvron [2125-7-3]) and atrial fibrillation who presents from hisrehabilitation center with altered mental status..the patient was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic servicefrom [2125-7-2] - [2125-7-26] for worsening shortness of breath thoughtto be due to worsening as, mr, and worsening heart failure (ef40%). he was taken to the or on [7-3] for aortic valve replacementwith a st. jude's valve, aortic endarterectomy, and mvr with a[company 1543] mosaic tissue valve. his hospital course wascomplicated by hypotension requiring pressor support andeventual failure to extubate due to altered mentalstatus/encephalopathy and inability to handle secretions. hereceived trach and peg on [2125-7-17]. he also received 7 days ofvancomycin and cefepime for the secretions (presumably foremperic treatment of vap). of note, he did have some deleriumnoted at night -- seroquel was attempted but discontinued due tosomnolence.he was tolerated trach collar, pm valve, and tube feeds prior todischarge to [hospital6 1293]..his daughter reports that at baseline, he has baseline dementiabut has some baseline cognitive function, including being alert,interactive, and talkative.  of note, trach was also removed atrehab. however, his mental status at rehab has been waxing and[doctor last name 688] during his rehab stay (documented in multiplecardiothoracic np[md number(3) 29639] as having confusion at rehaboccasionally requiring restraints and wandering), but noted byhis dtr to be worsening over the past week since he wastransferred to a new [hospital1 1501]. he has had episodes of jerkingmovements of his fingers or a 'kick' of the legs.independently, he also has episodes of lethargy, where he falls"asleep" mid-sentence, is unresponsive to tactile or verbalstimuli, then returns to his baseline but appearsdrowsy/confused. these unresponsive episodes were occurring [2-28]times a day, but were also increasing in frequency during theweek prior to admission. haldol and trazodone have beenattempted at rehab without good effect and were discontinued duethe drowsiness as well as (per ed report) some symptoms of lipsmacking that were thought to be [2-27] tardive dyskinesia. he wasoriginally discharged on tube feeds, but per report has beentolerating a po diet. he was brought into the ed today forfurther evaluation of these symptoms..in the ed, initial vs were: 98.5 90 130/102 18 99% on room airpatient was given ativan 2 mg iv x1, vancomyin 1 gram iv

pm. he was noted multiple times by the edattendings and residents to have multiple (>3) lethargicepisodes and multiple episodes of myoclonic jerks. the patientwould be responsive afterwards, but somewhat confused perreport, stating he was 'in brookline'. he got 2 mg of ativan forpresumed seizure activity and became unresponsive with slightdesaturation requiring bipap. neurology was consulted in the edand thought the patient was having myoclonicjerks/encephalopathy, but exam was clouded by recently receivingativan. head ct with no acute intracranial process. ctademonstrated no pe, lll aspiration pneumonitis, and a stableaaa. he was initially going to be taken onto the neurologyservice, but due to concern for his unresponsiveness andpossible respiratory compromise, he was admitted
