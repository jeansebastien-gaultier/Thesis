examination :post angiogram her eyes were closed .she was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely .she was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .she maintained her fixation on the conversation well .the cranial nerve exam :pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .the left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .disks were flat .sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .quadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right .gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .laboratory data :on admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of st depression in v4 to v6 , which is likely the patient 's baseline .ck 's were mildly elevated but the mb fractions were not remarkable .a chest x-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .hospital course :the patient was taken to the intensive care unit after her angiogram .she was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .a small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .she was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .this was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .for a short time , she seemed " locked in " .she has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .she is unable to lift either foot off the bed .the extra ocular movements are full .tongue protrudes 4 cm .she is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .she has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .she has been working with speech therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .she is anticoagulated on coumadin and this has been stable .she is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .the patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .a chest x-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .initially this improved on clindamycin and cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .sputum grew out klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with gentamicin and ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .a left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .the patient is on ciprofloxacin .the day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .she has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on nystatin swish and spit five times a day .she also gets peridex to clean out her mouth .once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .she has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .the patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the sgot and sgpt .these have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .a right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .the exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .the patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .the plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .the patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .this is thought due to the extensive course of gentamicin which she received .this must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .the patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .this may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .her sodiums were never below 130 .she does well with tube feeds .her tube feeds orders are as follow :full strength replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .in addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .she also gets lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .she also gets metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .it is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for g tube placement are made at this time .she has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .she did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .in the first week of november , her electrocardiogram showed t wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the ldh , but not ck .this did not normalize with administration of isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .as of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .her cholesterol was 350 here .she has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .these can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .medications on discharge :metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , lactinex as above , tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , cardizem slow release 90 mg. po q.d. , folic acid 1 mg. po q.d. , ciprofloxacin 500 mg. po b.i.d. , discontinue on 12/10/92 kayciel 30 meq. down nasogastric tube q.d. , peridex 10 cc. swish and spit q.i.d. , coumadin 4 mg. nasogastric tube on odd days , alternating with 5 mg. nasogastric tube on even days , once daily , tylenol 650 mg. po and pr q6hours prn pain , nystatin powder to axilla and groin as needed .discharge diagnosis :basilar artery stenosis with basilar thrombosis and " top of the basilar " syndrome .includes recent infarct to pons , mid brain , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes and left visual cortex , on coumadin .the patient is do not resuscitate at family 's request .left lower lobe pneumonia , resolving now on oral antibiotics .gallstones , thought to be inactive .improving liver enzyme elevation .anemia , discharge hematocrit 28 , not iron deficient .low potassium , thought due to gentamicin .low sodium , responsive to fluid restriction .history of coronary artery disease .thrush .high cholesterol .the patient needs prothrombin time checked daily , patient needs potassium checked daily , patient needs sodium checked at least every other day .do joasscchird , m.d.dictating for :narea
