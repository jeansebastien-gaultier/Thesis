ptt 27.0 .urinalysis was within normal limits .chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .ekg showed question of mat vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .there was st scooping in the lateral leads consistent with dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .there was no significant change from his baseline ekg .hospital course :the patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .he was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated leuco four units .the patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .he again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .his hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .the patient remained asymptomatic from a chf stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .it is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his ldh was within normal limits .in addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .the patient was discharged with follow-up with his hematologist , dr. eci area and rheumatologist , dr. taange peter , and cardiologist , dr. peter .medications on discharge :prednisone 10 mg po q day , verapamil 80 mg po t.i.d. , digoxin 0.25 mg po q day , isordil 20 mg po t.i.d. , theo-dur 200 mg po b.i.d. , lasix 80mg q am , 40 mg po q pm , enalapril 2.5 mg po b.i.d. , pepcid 20 mg po b.i.d.condition on discharge :stable .follow up care :follow-up with his various doctors as noted above .dictated by :caghala uinteele , m.d. he27attending :taange q. peter , m.d. lx12 jl816/3429batch :2749index no.bhnzeg2mvvd :12/03/93t :12/05/93cc :1. dr. eci area , hemotology fellow at rwstmmco2. dr. peter , cardiology
