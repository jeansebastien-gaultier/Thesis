ulcerations.concern for atheroembolization was raised following cardiaccatheterization. in followup , the patient appeared to havepersistent ulcerations as well as erythema. pedal signals bydoppler , however , were present. she was admitted from clinic forcellulitis and further evaluation of her vascular anatomy. atthe time of admission , she denied chest pain , shortness of breathor fever ,

heart rate of 121 in sinus tachycardia , blood pressure116/60 , saturating 98% on room air. she was noted to have a 2/6systolic murmur at the apex. lungs were clear bilaterally.pulse exam showed no palpable femoral pulses and biphasicdopplerable pulses bilaterally , dp and pt. extremities showedbilateral mottling of all toes and an open 0.5 cm ulceration atthe base of the left fourth toe. all toes are exquisitely tenderto palpation. sensation is decreased but equal bilaterally.hospital course: this 75-year-old female vasculopath wasadmitted for further evaluation of her peripheral vasculardisease which was suspected to be contributing to her newulcerations and progressively worsening wrist pain as anexacerbating factor to likely atheroembolic phenomenon , statuspost coronary catheterizations earlier in the year. she wasplaced on broad-spectrum antibiotics and plan was made for an mrato evaluate her anatomy. unfortunately , the patient was unableto tolerate the mr and did experience some mental status changesthat prevented further noninvasive imaging , when she receivedsome narcotic following her hemodialysis round. over the ensuingdays she required rather significant doses of zyprexa and haldolto contain agitation and delirium , as the patient would also getphysical and violent. this appeared to sedate her sufficientlyand over the following days , she did manage to calm significantlyand returned to her baseline mental status. she did appear veryemotionally labile throughout the rest of her stay and incrediblyremorseful for previous events. on 6/28/2006 , she was offeredan angiogram to delineate aortic and bilateral lower extremityrunoff anatomy. she did tolerate this well under simple ivconscious sedation. this showed chronic disease withcollateralization and very poor inflow to the bilateral feet withessentially one vessel run off on either side. after extensivediscussions with the patient and the patient's family , thepatient did agree to a left femoral to dorsalis pedis bypassgraft which was performed on 9/22/2006 without complication.please see the operative note for further details. the patientdid tolerate the procedure well. by time of discharge , she wastolerating a regular diet and ambulating at baseline with herrolling walker. the pain was well controlled with minimalanalgesics that were not narcotic based. cardiology wasconsulted during this time to optimize her prior to the or. herprimary cardiologist , dr. fugle did make some recommendationsincluding an echocardiogram that showed preserved ejectionfraction and no wall motion abnormalities. her beta blockade wastitrated up and she was instructed to follow up with cardiology.she did tolerate hemodialysis throughout this time without unduedifficulty. she did on one occasion experience dyspnea followinghemodialysis that resolved of its own accord , no cardiac eventsor in evidence by ekg or by following cardiac enzymes. as thepatient was in stable condition and back to her baseline level ofactivity with very strong support at home , she was discharged tohome with services for wound checks and home safety evaluation.she was instructed to follow up with dr. sedlachek in one to twoweeks.discharge instructions:1. touchdown weightbearing on the left heel. the patient shouldnot keep legs in dependent position for more than 10 minutes at atime. she was to use the walker and a cane as instructed byphysical therapy.2. legs are to be elevated as much as possible while sitting orlying down.3. all home medications were to be resumed except for lopressor
