right bundle-branch block with t wave inversion inv1 through v4; q waves in ii , iii , and avf; first-degree avblock; and a question of a left anterior fascicular block.a chest x-ray at the outside hospital on november , 2005 , was withbibasilar opacities with a question of atelectasis versuspneumonia.admission ekg here on march , 2005 , was unchanged from theoutside hospital.admission chest x-ray on done on march , 2005 , showedcardiomegaly and mild bilateral costophrenic angle blunting.hospital course: subjectively , this is an 82-year-old male witha history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fractionof 10% to 15% status post myocardial infarction , hypertension ,diabetes mellitus , and hypothyroidism who was transferred to thelas health network for an elective automaticimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.1. cardiovascular: ischemia. the patient had no activeischemia. he does have a history of a myocardial infarction ,which was inferior in area. his ett-mibi was with mild lateralwall ischemia with a large fixed inferior and inferolateraldefect. the patient was continued on aspirin , ace inhibitor , andstatin and restarted on his beta-blocker. a catheterization wasperformed on march , 2005 , which demonstrated a left dominantsystem and no significant left main or left anterior descendingartery lesions. a left posterior descending artery had an 80%lesion in the mid posterior descending artery. ejection fractionwas estimated at 15% with global hypokinesis and dilated leftatrium and dilated left ventricle. the patient had elevatedwedge pressure of 42 and 2+ mitral regurgitation.2. pump: the patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy.on admission , he was volume overloaded with a bnp of 2035. onadmission , the patient was treated with lasix , isordil , aceinhibitor , and digoxin. hydralazine was added. acatheterization on march , 2005 , demonstrated elevated leftheart-filling pressures. the patient was diuresed subsequentlywith more than 4 liters and was euvolemic upon discharge. thepatient is currently euvolemic on p.o. lasix to being slightlydry. given increased co2 but a normal bun and creatinine , wehave changed the patient's lasix dose to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40mg p.o. q.p.m. upon discharge. given the systolic bloodpressures in the 90s and 100s , the patient's lisinopril waschanged to 20 mg p.o. q.d. the patient is to be followed by vnaat home to monitor blood pressure.3. rhythm: the patient was followed by ep. his admissionelectrocardiogram showed a right bundle-branch block with aquestion of left anterior fascicular block and a first-degreearteriovenous block. on march , 2005 , the patient becamesuddenly bradycardic to the 30s and 40s with nonsustainedventricular tachycardia x30 beats and a new second-degreearteriovenous block type 1. the patient was asymptomaticthroughout this. zoll pads were placed , and atropine was put atthe bedside. on november , 2005 , the patient appeared to be back innormal sinus rhythm. on november , 2005 , a pacemaker with automaticimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed with cardiacresynchronization therapy as well. this was interrogated on november , 2005 , and the ??___?? were confined. the patient will followup with dr. valko in ep on august , 2005 , at 10:20 a.m. thepatient is to avoid vigorous activity.4. endocrine: the patient is with diabetes mellitus and wascovered with regular insulin sliding scale here. he was advisedto restart on his home dose of glyburide 7.5 mg q.d. upondischarge. the patients' history of hypothyroidism and thyroidfunction test is consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome. he wascontinued on levothyroxine at his home dose.5. psychiatry: the patient is given trazodone and ativan q.h.s.p.r.n. the patient's mental status was somewhat decreased on thenight of november , 2005 , status post automatic implantablecardioverter-defibrillator placement. he was not oriented totime. this later resolved by the evening of july , 2005.6. genitourinary: the patient was noted to have bloody urineafter receiving heparin during the catheterization thoughtsecondary to foley trauma. there were no clots; however , givensignificant hematuria , ??___?? foley was placed and bladderirrigation was started. urinalysis was negative. urine was pinkcolored by the night of july , 2005. the foley was discontinueddue to a leakage. this was not replaced given good urine output ,continued pink-colored urine , and no clots. the patient'shematocrit was stable throughout this.7. prophylaxis: the patient was given pneumoboots given the newautomatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement andhematuria.8. infectious disease: the patient is to be on clindamycin for7 days status post pacemaker placement.discharge medications: aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , atenolol 12.5 mgp.o. q.d. , clindamycin 300 mg p.o. q.i.d. through march , 2005 ,digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. , lasix 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. and lasix 40mg p.o. q.p.m. , hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. , levothyroxine 150mcg p.o. q.d. , lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d. , ativan 0.5 mg p.o.q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.insomnia , zocor 20 mg p.o. q.h.s. , imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d. ,glyburide 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. , magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,and kcl slow release 20 meq p.o. q.d.diet: the patient's diet on discharge;
