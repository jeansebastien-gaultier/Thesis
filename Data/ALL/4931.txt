record date: 2078-07-01	cardiology		oakland associates center		interval history:   this 63 y/o male patient with a h/o htn, hlp, non-revascularized 4-vessel cad, preserved lv systolic function, pad with past pta and stenting to the r eia and distal l sfa, tobacco abuse, type 2 dm, peripheral neuropathy, l ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, gerd, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis presents to the oac cath lab this morning for a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure.  the patient was last seen in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up by dr. levi barton at the oac 04/09/2078, at which time he reported recurrent and persistent ble claudication symptoms, rle > lle, with pain in his buttocks, thighs, and calves with ambulation.  he reports that these symptoms, coupled with his peripheral neuropathy symptoms, have become quite debilitating and lifestyle-limiting.  the patient denies any chronic or poorly-healing ulcers or sores on his feet or lower extremities.  given his history and symptomatic complaints, dr. barton recommended that the patient be scheduled to undergo an elective peripheral arteriogram to re-assess his pad and, if indicated and feasible, to pursue percutaneous revascularization.  the patient had previously undergone a peripheral angiogram at the oac on 11/21/2077, performed by dr. barton, which culminated in pta and stenting to the r eia and the distal l sfa, the former with a balloon-expandable biliary stent and the latter with a self-expanding biliary stent.  follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies performed at the oac in 01/2078 revealed a depressed resting abi of 0.70 in the rle, which dropped to 0.24 following exercise (as well as a resting abi of 1.00 in the lle which decreased to 0.50 post-exercise).  the patient has not been treated with pletal in the past.  an important side note is the fact that the patient's diagnostic lhc procedure at the oac in 10/2077 revealed significant 4-vessel cad, which for some reason was treated medically rather than surgically or percutaneously.  the patient has expressed a desire to have his coronary arteries re-assessed by angiography during today's peripheral catheterization procedure, not particularly because of any recurrent cp but mostly out of concern that his cad may have worsened and because he may undergo surgery for his l ulnar nerve compression in the relatively near future. 	past medical history:   1.   hypertension (managed with chronic beta-blocker and ace-inhibitor medications).2.   hyperlipidemia (managed with a chronic "statin" medication).3.   coronary artery disease (4-vessel disease noted during the 10/2077 lhc procedure, with no past percutaneous or surgical revascularization procedures).4.   preserved left ventricular systolic function (ef estimated at 65% by lv-gram during the lhc at the oac in 10/2077).5.   peripheral artery disease (involving the bles, with pta and stenting to both the distal l sfa and the r eia at the oac in 11/2077).6.   type 2 diabetes mellitus (hgba1c 8.2% on 06/27/2078;  treated with ohas).7.   peripheral neuropathy (per the patient;  being treated with neurontin).8.   left ulnar nerve compression (seen by dr. ryan and considering surgical treatment).9.   ulcerative colitis (treated effectively with prednisone during exacerbations).10.   gastro-esophageal reflux disease (treated with a chronic ppi medication).11.   gouty arthritis (infrequent exacerbations;  no chronic uricosuric pharmacotherapy).12.   depressive disorder (treated with chronic pharmacotherapy).13.   anxiety disorder (treated with benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy).14.   tobacco abuse (35 pack-year history, with cessation 5 months ago).past

elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal portion of the stent (psv 178 cm/sec), with normal velocities at the distal end of the stent (psv 73 cm/sec).  duplex u/s also revealed revealed significantly elevated blood flow velocities in the proximal l pfa (psv 306 cm/sec), as well as moderately elevated velocities in the proximal-to-mid l sfa (psv 191 cm/sec).  findings consistent with hemodynamically significant pad of the bles.    	assessment and plan:   assessment:63 y/o male patient with a h/o htn, hlp, non-revascularized 4-vessel cad, preserved lv systolic function, pad with past pta and stenting to the r eia and distal l sfa, tobacco abuse, type 2 dm, peripheral neuropathy, l ulnar nerve compression, ulcerative colitis, gerd, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and gouty arthritis who presents to the oac cath lab today for the purpose of undergoing a scheduled elective peripheral arterial catheterization procedure because of recurrent ble claudication symptoms (rle > lle).  in addition, a diagnostic coronary angiogram will most likely be performed as well, particularly because of the patient's known unrevascularized multi-vessel cad and the likelihood that he may undergo surgery in the relatively near future for his l ulnar nerve compression.  the patient is presently asymptomatic at rest, hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm, well-oxygenated on room air, in no distress, and ready to proceed with his scheduled elective catheterization procedure today.plan:1.   proceed with the planned catheterization procedure this morning, which will include coronary angiography and ble peripheral angiography (+/- possible percutaneous revascularization).2.   informed written consent obtained from the patient (by one of the peripheral vascular interventional fellow) pre-procedure this morning.3.   no pre-medication for renal and/or allergy prophylaxis appears clinically warranted prior to angiography.4.   admit the patient to the oac on the inpatient service of dr. barton post-procedure.5.   continue the patient on his same prior regimen and doses of ecasa, plavix, toprol-xl, lisinopril, and zocor.  6.   continue holding the patient's prior metformin for 48 hours following contrast administration during angiography today.7.   monitor the patient's fsbg values and covering with sliding scale regular insulin as needed for episodes of hyperglycemia.8.   continue the patient on glipizide, a ppi (prilosec in place of his usual protonix while at the oac [formulary limitations]), neurontin, effexor, chantix, hytrin, and vitamin-b12.9.   lab testing tomorrow morning should include the following:   cbc, chem-7, mg, cpks, hs-crp, lipoprotein(a), and homocysteine.10.   discharge timing will depend upon today's procedural findings and events, the patient's peri- and post-catheterization course, and the potential need for further monitoring, testing, or treatment in the inpatient setting.11.   following his hospital discharge, the patient should see dr. barton in outpatient vascular medicine follow-up in approximately 4 - 6 weeks, with follow-up lower extremity non-invasive studies (particularly resting and post-exercise abis) at that time.12.   will re-address with dr. barton the need to consider the patient's need for coronary arterial revascularization, either percutaneously or surgically, given the severity and multi-vessel involvement.13.   further plans and recommendations as per dr. barton.isaac w. paredes, m.a., m.h.s., m.p.h., pa-cphysician assistant - certifiedcardiology divisionoakland associates
