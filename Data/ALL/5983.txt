patientwas given bolus iv fluids and levophed.  her cvp was maintainedabove 8.  she was eventually weaned off of the levophed.  anextensive workup for the source of infection was limited bypatient's wishes.  she had a tte which was negative but refusedan mri of the spine.  the patient was afebrile during the icucourse.  surveillance cultures were negative after [2114-11-14].she will receive long
