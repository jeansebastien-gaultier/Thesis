cerebellar.7. status post a right cea in 1981 , and left cea , that is acarotid endarterectomy , in 1999.8. peripheral vascular disease , status post aortofemoral bypassin 1999.medications at home:toprol 200 mg daily , isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , hydralazine 25 mgt.i.d. , lipitor 80 mg daily , aspirin 325 mg daily , plavix 75 mgdaily , lasix 160 mg b.i.d. , zantac 150 mg b.i.d. , phoslo t.i.d. ,and lantus.allergies:arbs cause hives.social history:a 135-pack-year tobacco history. no alcohol or illicits. thepatient lives alone.family history:coronary artery disease ( mother in her 50's ).imaging:chest x-ray on 8/4/05 showed a moderate right pleural effusion ,cephalization and pulmonary edema. ekg showed q waves in 2 , 3and avf with t-wave inversions ( old findings , no acute changes ).echo ( 6/25 ): ef 35% ( down from 55% in 1/5 ) , mild concentriclvh , diffuse global hypokinesis with new akinesis of theseptal-inferior walls.hospital course:1. cardiovascular:a. pump - persistent volume overload , minimal response todiuresis with 20 mg/hour lasix drip. attempted diuresis withdiuril , lasix iv , and finally nesiritide. nesiritidediscontinued on 10/25/05 .  torsemide was started on 10/25/05 withimproved diuresis. the patient has consistently refuseddialysis. blood pressure was controlled during thishospitalization with hydralazine , isordil , and lopressor. allmedications were stopped on 9/20/05 .  ejection fraction 35%.b. ischemia - enzymes peaked on 10/5/05 with a ck of 152 , an mbof 39.6 , and a troponin of 21.44. ekg at this time showed stdepressions in v4 through v6. the recommendation of thecardiology team was that the patient undergo cardiaccatheterization. the patient refused any intervention withcardiac catheterization due to concerns of further damage to herkidneys. a decision was made to medically manage the patient.she was briefly on heparin while this decision was concluded , andheparin was stopped on 5/22/05 with enzymes trending down , andno evidence of active ischemia.c. rhythm - the patient had bursts of normal sinus ventriculartachycardia on telemetry. she was maintained on a low-dosebeta-blocker until 10/25/05 .  she has been in a normal sinusrhythm from 10/5/05 through 9/20/05 . 2. pulmonary: the patient has an oxygen requirement of 2 literssecondary to a right pleural effusion and congestive heartfailure. the patient's iv diuretics were stopped on 9/20/05 inconsideration of changing goals of care. if the patient becomesshort of breath in the absence of diuretics , we would recommendmorphine elixir 10 mg q.2 h. as needed for shortness of breath.3. renal: the patient's chronic renal insufficiency was likelysecondary to hypertension and diabetes. mra on 10/5/05 toevaluate for renal artery stenosis showed right renal arterystenosis. the patient's creatinine increased to 4 on 10/25/05 ,likely secondary to diuresis. ultrasound was refused. the renalconsult team was following , but the patient refused any dialysis.4. endo: the patient's diabetes was controlled with lantusinsulin and an aspart insulin sliding scale. there was concernfor hypoglycemia on 9/20/05 in the setting with no oral intake.all of the patient's diabetic medications have been stopped atthis time.5. psychiatry: the psychiatry consult team was consulted formajor depressive disorder. there was concern for delirium.celexa was started for depression. seroquel was tried p.r.n. forinsomnia and delirium , but it was stopped due to change in mentalstatus. the patient was able to make her own medical decisionsat the time of refusing cardiac catheterization. she understoodthe risk of refusing cardiac catheterization. we will continueno psychiatric medications at the time of discharge. mayconsider haldol for concern regarding worsening delirium.6. the patient is currently dnr/dni , comfort measures only. sheis being transferred to inpatient hospice at gateho health . medications at the time of discharge:include morphine elixir 10 mg p.o. q.2 h. as needed for shortnessof breath.condition at the time of discharge:poor.escription document: 8-4052730 emssten teldictated by: gabak , nevilleattending: matsuzaki , arliedictation id 5371974d: 9/20/05t: 9/20/05[report_end]
