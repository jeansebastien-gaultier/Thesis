m.d.admission diagnosis: cardiac arrest.discharge diagnosis: sepsis/line infection , end-stage renaldisease on hemodialysis.history of present illness: this is a 54-year-old female with ahistory of cardiomyopathy , hypertension , diabetes type 2 ,end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who had a reportedcardiac arrest while receiving dialysis on 3/25/06 in heroutpatient clinic at richgo ster ha she began to feel nauseated andthen vomited. the patient then reportedly went into vfib and wasshocked once by ems , resulting in a narrow qrs complex rhythm.she was intubated , received amiodarone and dopamine , as her bp wasapproximately 70s systolic over palpable diastolic. in the ed , a portablechest x-ray revealed diffuse bilateral opacities , risk of pulmonary edema andabg showed respiratory acidosis. pt was transferred to the icu for furthermanagement.of note , she was recently hospitalized at somver vasky university of medical center on 7/1/06through 10/11/07 for initiation of dialysis after her bun and creatininehad risen remarkably from baseline. she was then asymptomatic atthat time. a fistulogram and angioplasty of her right av fistulawas performed on 7/6/06 with prednisone premedication but itwas unsuccessful and therefore a left ij tunneled dialysiscatheter was inserted on 1/18/06 with the tip ending in theright atrium. she has since received dialysis treatments with nocomplication.past medical history: coronary artery disease ,chf , echo in july of 1999 shows moderate left ventricularhypertrophy of about 65% , diabetes type 2 20 years including withretinopathy , nephropathy and neuropathic pain , hypertension forthe past 20 years , hypercholesterolemia , status post medullarycva july 1999 , right pica resulting wallenberg's syndrome ,morbid obesity , left knee degenerative joint disease ,iron-deficiency anemia.allergies: iv contrast , which gives her anaphylaxis ,tetracycline to an unknown reaction , lisinopril.home medications: at the time of admission include amitriptyline25 mg p.o. bedtime , enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily ,enalapril 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. , lasix 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. , losartan50 mg p.o. daily , toprol-xl 200

sevelamer 1200 mg p.o.t.i.d. , tramadol 25 mg p.o. q.6 h. p.r.n. pain.social history: this patient is single and has one son and onegrandson. arturo randklev is the healthcare proxy and is her son.she worked 30 years for wi co baya and is currently retired.physical examination on admission: her vital signs weretemperature 97.6 , heart rate 72 , bp of 115/66 with mean arterialpressure of 83 , respiratory 14 , sating 100% on 60% inspired fio2.her cvp at admission was 17 to 20. the patient is an obese woman who wasintubated and responded to voice. her pupils were 3 to 2 mmbilaterally. her extraocular movements were intact. her chestexam was notable for diffuse crackles throughout with good airmovement. cardiac auscultation revealed regular rate and rhythmwith no murmurs , rubs or gallops. her abdomen was soft ,nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.extremities showed no edema. distal pulses were not palpablebilaterally. she has thickened hyperpigmented skinchanges on both feet.laboratory data: significant labs on admission included a sodiumof 141 , potassium 4.1 , chloride of 102 , bicarb of 31 , bun 33 ,creatinine 4.2 with a glucose of 156. her hematocrit was 32.an abg at 10 p.m. of admission on fio2 of 60% revealed a ph of 7.36 , pco2 of52 , po2 91. her first set of cardiac enzyme revealed acreatinine kinase of 116 and the mb fraction of 0.7 and troponint of less than assay and lactate of 1.8. tox screen wasnegative. urinalysis was remarkable for 2+ protein , 3+ blood andpositive for nitrates , and negative for leuks , 4 to 10 whiteblood cells , 15 to 25 red blood cells , 2+ bacteria , 1+ squamousepithelial cells.imaging: significant imaging at admission was an x-ray for chestx-ray revealing diffuse bilateral opacities , possible pulmonaryedema versus aspiration pneumonia , an ekg showing normal sinusrhythm 100 beats per minute with no acute st changes and oldt-wave inversion in v2.assessment: this is a 55-year-old female with end-stage renaldisease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetes who had an apparentvfib arrest at hemodialysis on 7/8/06 and was shocked andadmitted to the ccu after being intubated in the vibay general hospital ed. thepatient had difficulty weaning from vent and was finallyextubated on 11/11/06. the ccu course was also complicated bycoag-negative staph grown from a quinton catheter blood draw.the catheter was changed to over a wire on 11/11/06. bloodcultures on 10/24/06 revealed likely staph aureus growth forwhich the patient received continuous vancomycin.hospital course by problems:1. question of vfib arrest. whether or not the patient actuallyhad a vfib arrest seems to be in some doubt as she never had anarrhythmia on tele here by report and her troponin when peaked at0.14 on 3/25/06 after receiving one external defibrillator shockat hemodialysis. we believe what likely happened was a vagal event duringhemodialysis , possibly including a pause misread at vf by the defibrillator.this explantation is supported by the observation that she has beencontinuously having nausea with dialysis and her known a historyof vasovagal episodes in the past. echo on 3/25/06 shows an efof 60 to 65% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophyand no wall motion abnormalities. the patient was continued ontelemetry and treated with her home dose of beta-blocker withgood response.2. volume status. the patient is very close to her dry weightupon discharge , which she gives at 354 pounds by wet scale. shehas been continued on hemodialysis with good results.3. possibly infected hemodialysis catheter. the patient had asingle set of coag-negative staph positive blood cultures fromquinton catheter on 11/12/06. line was changed over wire7/28/06 and was treated with vancomycin dose by renal levels.the patient continued to grow out coag-negative staph , positiveblood cultures from 2 out of 2 sets drawn on 8/30/06.4. anemia. in the setting of end-stage renal disease herbaseline hematocrit is about 30 and stable.5. diabetes type 2. she was treated with a portland protocolduring her icu course wand was switched to a long andshort-acting subcutaneous insulin approaching her home dose of nph bid.6. fen. the patient was gradually advanced to an oral diet withno signs of aspiration status post extubation.7. prophylaxis. the patient received heparin subcutaneously andnexium.8. code. the patient is full code. her healthcare proxy is herson noble schomberg , 284-659-2493.disposition: this patient will likely need rehab and is beingscreened by pt and ot and will likely be discharged to rehab whenbed is available.escription document: 7-7801705 cssten teldictated by: artola , garyattending: dix , reggiedictation id 0252108d: 1/17/06t: 1/17/06
