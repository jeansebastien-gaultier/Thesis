r humerus orif presenting from crest nursing home with sob and htn. she was discharged from ngh to rehab on 1/8/2075 after orif of a right humeral fracture. she feels that she has been doing fairly at rehab. on the evening prior to admission, however, she had some anxiety that resolved after receiving ativan from her nurse. she then was able to fall asleep but woke-up at 2am with diaphoresis and sob. she denied chest pain. she was attended to and her bp was 220/117. she was given 2 sl ntg, o2, and lasix, after which her sob somewhat improved but her htn continued. she also complains of a chronic cough that is productive of white/yellow sputum. she denies missed medications, changes in diet, adding salt to meals (although she is at rehab and her diet order is unclear). at this time, she denies cp, sob. ed course:  vitals upon arrival to the ed were t 98.9   hr 114  bp 225/125 rr 32  02 sat  84% ra. exam was notable for tachycardia, rales at the apices, use of accessory muscles,

clips are again noted projected over the left lower hemithorax.  no definite focal consolidation is demonstrated. pleura:  there is no pneumothorax. the hemidiaphragms are very slightly less distinct than on the comparison study.  this could be related to the onset of parenchymal changes of chf, but could also be related to a small amount of pleural fluid. impression: findings consistent with

the precipitant of her flash pulmonary edema is less clear, however. she describes waking up acutely short of breath and was found to be profoundly hypertensive. it is possible that htn 2/2 a change in her diet or fluid intake at rehab, ischemia, increases renin-aldo, or other cause led to flash pulmonary edema.  conversely, however, chf may have precipitated her htn. 1. shortness of breath/chf:
