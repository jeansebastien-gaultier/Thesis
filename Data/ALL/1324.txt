chf , and stage iv chronic renal insufficiency ,who presented to the emergency room on 8/26/2005 with wheezingand shortness of breath following a three-day prodrome of cough ,congestion , and chills. in the emergency room , the patient wasnoted to have a bnp of 519 and was initially treated with lasixin the emergency room , and was admitted at that point fordiagnosis of copd exacerbation in the setting of an upperrespiratory infection in addition to mild congestive heartfailure. the patient was given oral glucocorticoids and frequentbronchodilator therapy was initiated. however , the patient'smental status began to rapidly decline. as he became moresomnolent , he was noted to have an abg with a ph of 7.16. thepatient was then transferred to the icu for hypercarbicrespiratory failure after failing an initial trial of bipap.past medical history: copd , requiring at least two priorintubations; congestive heart failure , previously thought to bediastolic with an ef of 50%;

mild clubbing and trace edema bilaterally.laboratory studies upon admission: notable for electrolyte panelwithin normal limits. bun of 52 , creatinine of 3.3 , and glucoseof 154. bnp was 317. hemogram showed a white blood cell countof 7.7 , hematocrit 40.6 , and platelets 219. mcv was low at 80.chest x-ray showed interstitial edema , no infiltrates. ekgshowed no acute changes from prior.assessment and plan: this is a 65-year-old male with history ofcopd who is admitted for a copd exacerbation in the setting of alikely viral uri as well as some mild congestive heart failureexacerbation.hospital course by system: pulmonary: as noted above , thepatient was noted to be having hypercarbic respiratory failurewith an abg of 7.16/98/89 on 3 l nasal cannula. he was thereforetransferred to the micu and at that time required intubation.the patient's respiratory status improved and he was extubated on11/5/2005 .  the patient was initially treated with solu-medrol ,which was changed to prednisone on 4/20/2005 .  the patient wasnoted to have thick tenacious secretions and there was concernfor possible pneumonia as an underlying flare for the patient'scopd. therefore , the patient was initiated on levofloxacin for a14-day course. the patient had , upon presentation , been noted tobe mildly volume overloaded but this improved with diuresis priorto his micu stay. in the setting of the patient's intubation ,his ph corrected slowly , but he was still noted to have markedlyelevated partial co2 pressures. the patient was treated withchest pt as well as duonebs. following extubation , the patientwas transferred to the floor and did well. medications wereadjusted and he was continued on a prednisone taper , spiriva ,advair 250/50 diskus , supplemental oxygen , duonebs , and albuterolnebulizers as needed. the patient continued to improve , and on9/3/2005 , he was able to ambulate on room air without dyspneaor hypoxia. at this point , we suggest outpatient pulmonaryfunction tests to further evaluate the extent of the patient'sobstructive disease.cardiovascular: ischemia: the patient underwent a negative ruleout mi upon admission. this was obtained due to the newlydecreased ef of 35 to 40% that was noted on echocardiogram uponadmission. the patient has not had any ischemic symptoms;however , this marked decrease is concerning especially includingthe inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis , which is new fromhis prior echocardiogram. the patient was continued on aspirin ,beta-blocker , and statin. an ace inhibitor was reinitiated whenthe patient's creatinine stabilized. the patient will likelyneed further cardiac risk stratification as an outpatient toinclude an outpatient stress test.pump: as mentioned , upon admission , the patient was noted tohave mild volume overload. he has a history of diastolicdysfunction with a prior echocardiogram showing an ef of 50%. asnoted , the most recent echocardiogram obtained during thishospitalization shows an ef of 35% with diffuse globalhypokinesis and inferior posterior wall akinesis. there was milddecreased function of the rv as well , and mild left atrialenlargement and mild right atrial enlargement. the patient isnoted to have relatively stable pulmonary hypertension with a papressure of 50 plus right atrial pressure.the patient had been diuresed aggressively in the emergency roomand therefore did not require additional diuresis upon transferto the micu. the patient was initiated on hydralazine andisordil for afterload reduction. when the patient's creatininestabilized , these were changed back to an ace inhibitor. thepatient was continued on a beta-blocker as well. the patient wasrestarted on half of his home dose of lasix at lasix 160 mg p.o.daily as of 1/6/2006 when he was noted to be mildlyhypervolemic.in addition , the patient was noted to have significanthypertension. he has had a workup previously for secondarycauses of hypertension , which included a negative mra in 2004.the patient was continued on a clonodine patch as well asbeta-blocker , ace inhibitor , and imdur. the patient's homemedication of hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued , as was theamiloride , which may need to be reinitiated as an outpatient.rhythm: the patient was noted to have four beats of nonsustainedventricular tachycardia on 11/7/2005 , which resolved withaggressive electrolyte replacement. while in the micu , thepatient had a single run of 30 beats of nonsustained ventriculartachycardia , which improved with electrolyte replacement.endocrine: the patient has a history of diabetes and thereforewas continued on a regimen of nph initially at 20 units b.i.d.the patient was noted to have an episode of hypoglycemia withblood sugars around 40 and therefore the nph was decreased andthe patient will be discharged on a regimen of 15 units in themorning and 10 units at bedtime.the patient was also noted to have hyperparathyroidism likelyfrom renal disease , therefore secondary versus tertiaryhyperparathyroidism. the patient was therefore continued oncalcitriol.renal: the patient has stage iv chronic renal insufficiency.upon admission , the patient was noted to be oliguric. this islikely due to a prerenal state given diuresis on admission andfurther exacerbated by the patient's underlying renal disease.bladder scan was obtained which only showed 3 ml of urine in thebladder. the patient's urine output increased with afterloadreduction. the patient was noted to have acute-on-chronicrespiratory acidosis with chronic bicarbonate compensation.there was no anion gap. the lactate was measured and was only0.6 in the micu. throughout the remainder of thehospitalization , the patient's creatinine continued to improveand was measured at 3.4 on 1/6/2006 .  a renal consult wasobtained during the hospitalization. they did not feel thatthere was any indication for acute renal replacement. thepatient should continue to have renally dosed meds and continueon a renal diet , including phoslo. the patient will have closerenal followup within the next few weeks.hematologic: the patient was noted to have iron deficiencyanemia and was started on ferrous sulfate supplementation. atthis time , an epo level is still pending.infectious disease: the patient was initiated on levofloxacinfor a 14-day course , which was started on 4/13/2005 , and will becompleted as of 9/11/2006 .  blood cultures and sputum cultureswere obtained and are negative to date. influenza/adenovirus/rsvswabs were obtained and were negative.prophylaxis: the patient received heparin subcutaneous 5000units t.i.d. for dvt prophylaxis , and was continued on pepcid forgi prophylaxis.disposition: the patient was evaluated by physical therapy andfelt to be at his baseline. he is able to ambulate and maintainhis pulse oxymetry greater than 93%. the patient will bedischarged to home with visiting nurse service.to do:1. vna is to check the patient's blood pressure , oxygensaturation , as well as check weekly electrolytes and creatininelevels and call results to dr. loil office at 890-189-0562.the patient is to follow up with dr. johanns within the next week ,and at that time , should have his blood pressure meds titrated upas needed. the patient may require increased dose of lasix andthe amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide may be resumed as needed.2. the patient should have a cardiology outpatient followupregarding his decreased ef and new wall motion abnormalities.the patient may require stress imaging for further cardiac riskstratification.3. the patient should have renal follow up regarding his chronicrenal insufficiency and future need for hemodialysis.additional comments: continue to take all of your medications ,including the spiriva and advair , which replace the flovent aswell as the prednisone. follow up with dr. lapeyrouse within oneweek. participate with your visiting nurse services. seekmedical attention for increased
