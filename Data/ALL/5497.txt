and severe central canal stenosis (recent rch admission 1/23 - 2/03/50 for associated lue weakness), significant smoking history, rul nodule (since &#8217;42), and h/o bronchiectasis, who presents from his nursing home w/ reported episode of hypotension and unresponsiveness on 2/08 around lunchtime.  per notes, the pt was found to be unresponsive briefly after lunch, bp was checked and found to be in the 80&#8217;s systolic, ems was activated and an iv was placed.  he quickly became responsive without intervention, and bp came up to the 80s/90s.  per notes, no reported cp, abdominal pain, ha, lh, focal neurological symptoms, sob, palpitations.  of note, the pt was recently hospitalized at rch 1/23 &#8211; 2/03/50 during which time he had labile bp&#8217;s including htn as well as question of orthostasis, and was discharged on hydralazine, hctz, lisinopril, and labetalol, after having taken only atenolol and terazosin on admission.  at rehab on 2/05 (3days pta), his meds were changed to atenolol, terazosin, hctz, and lisinopril.in the ed, the pt&#8217;s vitals were t 96.4, hr 63, bp 98/53, rr 20, 95% on ra.  labs sig for na 129 (up to 131 after ns), cr 1.58 (baseline 1.0 to 1.1 but recently 1.4 to 1.6), wbc 9.2 up to 15.6 (83% pmn) during time in the ed, hct from 38.3 to 32.6 (mcv 85) in ed after fluids (guaiac negative), head ct negative, cxr w/ slightly more prominent bibasilar l &gt; r opacities.  he also c/o cough while in the ed, w/ no other symptoms, w/ report of some rhonchorous breath sounds.  two sets of blood cultures were drawn, he was given ivf (ns) at 120cc/hr, and he started on vancomycin and cefepime for presumed pna.on the floor, the pt complains of cough, mildly productive, but no fevers/chills, sob, doe, cp, hemoptysis, or any other sx, but is somewhat of a poor historian.  of note, pt had recent chest ct (i+) on 1/27/50 to evaluate known rul nodule, which showed likely aspiration pna w/ multifocal dependent consolidation.  pt initially was given 2days of levofloxacin, but per discharge summary pt was not clinically behaving as if he had pna, so abx were stopped.pmh / psh:-htn (recent med adjustments as

recent discharge, plus further titration at rehab in preceding few days.  mildly dry on exam, w/ likely hypovolemic hypona but will follow. hct drop since arrival, will re-check, possibly dilutional, guaiac negative. infection / pna--obtain sputum sample--vanco and cefepime given cough and wbc elev, presumed hap (possibly aspiration)--obtain u/a since none obtained in ed--f/u blood ctx x 2 hypotension on arrival--infectious workup / treatment as above--will only give labetalol and hydralazine for now (holding acei, hctz given mild renal failure above prior baseline), add back terazosin as necessary--gentle ivf overnight, re-check a.m. lytes (likely mild hypovolemic hyponatremia) and orthostatics after volume challenge anemia--guaiac negative in ed, will guaiac all stools, type and
