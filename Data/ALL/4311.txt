82-year-old male with a past history significant for htn, dm, cri, copd, and bph.  he recently underwent a two vessel cabg in april 2064. at that time he had presented to hcc in chf and w/ an nstemi. cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the lad and lcx territory and moderate disease in the rca. he underwent cabg on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a lima to the lad graft and an svg to the circumflex om. his post-operative course was uncomplicated.he presented to dsh on 8/14 w/ sob, found to be in chf (bnp 482). he denies any chest pain and at dsh he had no ischemic ekg changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial tni of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. his biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were ck 745 and ck-mb of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. he was transferred to hcc where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his lima at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his svg. a pa line and an iabp were placed and the patient was transferred to the ccu for further management.pmh / psh:cad     s/p  2-v cabg off pump in 4/64chf- ef 38%, mild mr,
