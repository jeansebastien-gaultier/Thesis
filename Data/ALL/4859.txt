record date: 2085-05-27 mr. ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan currently.  he took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the testing wont be done until tomorrow.  thyroid function tests were completely normal.  his chest x-ray is completely normal except for tracheal deviation i believe which is due to his goida.  i talked to him that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  i also said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  though slightly anxious he is agreeable to this. he did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further follow-up or treatment was necessary.we then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked a date namely jun 8th to quit .i tried to give him as much encouragement for that as i could. leroy x. oshea, m.d.    not reviewed by attending physician
