presented to the emergencydepartment on 4/17/06 with shortness of breath and dyspnea onexertion over the previous two months. the patient has knowncoronary artery disease and has undergone multiple ptcas andballoon angioplasties in the past of his posterior descending branchof his right coronary artery in 1996 , and stenting of hisposterior descending coronary artery in 2004 , also stenting ofhis distal right coronary artery in 2005. while in the emergencydepartment , the patient had an episode of substernal chestpressure radiating to his left jaw and left upper extremity. hereceived sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine with relief. ekgat that time revealed a right bundle-branch block with t-waveinversions in the leads v2 , v3 , and slightly t-wave elevation inleads ii , iii and avf. on 0/16/06 , he underwent cardiaccatheterization , which revealed the following , posteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 80% stenosis , rightcoronary artery with a distal 60% stenosis , left circumflexcoronary artery with the proximal 60% stenosis , left anteriordescending coronary artery with an ostial 50% stenosis. rightdominant circulation and right coronary artery had extensivestenting with 50-60% focal areas of restenosis. distal rightcoronary artery stent before bifurcation has 80% stenosis.echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 50% aorticstenosis with a mean gradient of 41 mmhg and peak gradient of 60mmhg , calculated valve area is 1 cm2 , mild aortic insufficiency ,moderate mitral insufficiency , moderate tricuspid insufficiency ,and mild pulmonic insufficiency. carotid ultrasound revealedright internal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis , leftinternal carotid artery with a 1-25% stenosis. pulmonaryfunction tests revealed fvc of 3.11 , 53% , and an fev1 of 1.66 ,35% predicted. chest ct also performed on 6/21/06 revealedcardiomegaly , massive calcifications involving the aortic valveand coronary arteries , pleural thickening bilaterally , nodulardensity measuring 7 mm in the lateral basal segment of the leftlung most likely represents round atelectasis or focal pleuralthickening , however , subpleural nodule cannot be excluded ,recommending a repeat chest ct in six months after discharge , andsmall ascites punctate calcifications in the pancreas.past medical and past surgical history:significant for myocardial infarction ,

bilaterally in the carotid and radial pulses ,1+ bilaterally in the femoral and dorsalis pedis pulses , andnonpalpable bilaterally in the posterior tibialis pulses.respiratory: breath sounds clear bilaterally. extremities:mild varicosities. there is 1+ pedal edema in bilateral lowerextremities , otherwise , noncontributory.admission laboratory values:sodium 138 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 97 ,

kreidler was brought to the operating room on 3/25/06 wherehe underwent an elective aortic valve replacement with a 25 mmcarpentier-edwards magna valve and a coronary artery bypass graftx2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descendingcoronary artery , saphenous vein graft to the posterior descendingcoronary artery. total bypass time was 164 minutes. totalcrossclamp time was 127 minutes. intraoperatively , the patientwas found to have a calcified trileaflet valve functionally was abicuspid due to effusion between the left and right cusp ,moderate adhesions in the left pleural space , requiringadhesiolysis to harvest the mammary artery. transesophagealechocardiogram post-repair revealed normal function of the aorticprosthetic valve and mild mitral regurgitation , with intermittentheart block following bypass predominantly with a pacing. thepatient did well intraoperatively , came off bypass withoutincident , was brought to the intensive care unit in normal sinusrhythm and in stable condition. please refer to dictationnumber 5125348 for the immediate postoperative course. thepatient was transferred to the step-down unit on 9/28/06 .  thepatient's mental status waxed and waned with confusion , initiallywas with sitters in the step-down unit , and also was in arate-controlled atrial fibrillation , with a good blood pressure ,and tolerated increasing beta-blocker. the patient's mentalstatus improved , did well off sitters , and continue withrate-controlled atrial fibrillation. mr. salser was placed oncoumadin for his atrial fibrillation. neurologically , heremained intact , and was placed on levofloxacin and vancomycinfor h. flu and staph pneumonia , which are both sensitive tobactrim , and started on a 5-day course of bactrim twice a day.he was cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day #9.discharge laboratory values:sodium 137 , potassium 4.3 , chloride 99 , co2 28 , bun 18 ,creatinine 0.9 , glucose 95 , and magnesium
