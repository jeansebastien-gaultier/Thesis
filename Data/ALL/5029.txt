date :            03/17/2000deathsummary principal diagnosis :duodenal perforationhistory of present illness :this is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a roux-en-y reconstruction .the patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , 03/13/00 .the patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .he had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .past medical history :history of small bowel obstruction in 04/17 and 07/15 , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .past surgical history :splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .medications on admission :epogen and vitamin b 12 injections .allergies :no known drug allergies .laboratory data on admission :white blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .physical exam :temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .abdomen :soft , slightly distended , nontender .no hernias .the patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .hospital course :the patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a ct scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .there was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .there was no evidence of perforation on the ct scan .the patient went to the operating room on the evening of 03/13/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the roux-en-y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .this was taken down and the roux-en-y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .there was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of crystalloid .however by the mid morning of the 14th of march , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .the patient was invasively lined with a swan ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .at this point the patient 's creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .the transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .the swan ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .on 03/14/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .however prior to this it was also noted that the patient 's scrotum was necrotic .an incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .in the abdomen the patient 's retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .the anastomosis appeared intact on examination .upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on neo-synephrine .he was hydrated vigorously .it should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .this was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .the patient 's urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .therefore the patient went back to the operating room on 03/15/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .further debridement was undertaken .the patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .the patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .on 03/16/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .the patient 's family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of 03/16/00 .the patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 03/17/00 .disposition on discharge :expired .dictated by :            eeen l. key , m.d. up72attending :            lenni
