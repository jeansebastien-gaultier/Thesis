sob and chest pain over 1 weeks time.  symptoms not related to exertion and reports sternal area is the location of pain.  occurs at rest. feels like pressure and at times sharp pain, not related to respiration. 7/10 when maximal intensity.  pain is constant in nature, patient states lasting up to hours at a time.  no specific provocative or palliative factors.  not related to position.  reports that sob and chest pain are chronic problems for her and the reason she presented to the ed is because the symptoms have increased over the past week.no associated symptoms of n/v or diaphoresis.

this does represent on acute change.denies fever/chills.  reports constipation at baseline (bms do not occur everyday). patient states she has    frequent sinus infections.   pmhxhtn, chf (good
