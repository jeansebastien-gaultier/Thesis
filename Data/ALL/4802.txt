:10/24/96discharge date :halloweenprincipal diagnosis :right middle cerebral artery infarct .associated diagnosis :urinary tract infection .clinical infections :urinary tract infection , e. coli .principal procedure :mri / mra .other procedures :echocardiogram , neurovascular ultrasound .history :patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .he had undergone c-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .at his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .he also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .his history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .past medical history :notable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression '92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .allergies :no known drug allergies .medications on admission :dexedrine 5 mg per day and motrin 600 mg tid .physical examination :on admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .his temperatureis 98.9 .his pressure is 150/90 .rate 76 .respirations 16 .he was edentulous .he had mild copper wiring .he has a i / vi systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .heart sounds were normal and regular .breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .he had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .he had 2+ carotids , no bruits .he had gynecomastia .rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .extremities :1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .he had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .his right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.his hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .his tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .he occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .mental state :he was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , oaksgekesser/ memorial hospital and the date .he was mildly perseverative and inattentive .coordination :his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .he was unable to stand without extensive assistance .laboratory data :sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , bun 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .on the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .ekg showed normal sinus rhythm , no st or t wave changes .hospital course and treatment :mr. finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .he underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .however , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .he had normal cervical vertebral arteries .transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .the proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .over the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .he had been started on heparin from the time of his admission .a computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .mri / mra was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the intensive care unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .his systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .however , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and neo-synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .this strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .while in the intensive care unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .he also , as neo-synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his intensive care unit stay had a right gaze preference .in terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .he was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .i should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .he had several repeat imaging studies during his intensive care unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and dwi images .additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion mr study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .he was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .at this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .we anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .he will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an inr goal of 2-3 , ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , dexedrine 5 mg po qd , omeprazole 20mg po qd , erythromycin eye ointment ou bid , heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the coumadin is therapeutic , tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , colace 100 mg po bid .follow up will be with dr. tvi fine of neurology , and dr. doll grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .bethtatcha w r new , m.d.dictating
