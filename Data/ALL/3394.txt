3.9 ) ,albumin 3.4 , white count of 7.1 , hematocrit of 33.5 , platelets of137 , ( baseline hematocrit usually 32-35 ) , lfts within normallimits ( alt , ast , alk phos , t bili ). first set of ed enzymeswere negative. bnp elevated at 655. ammonia elevated at 83.inr 1.2 , ptt 36.chest x-ray revealed enlarged central pulmonary arteries whichwere suggestive of pulmonary hypertension in this patient withobstructive sleep apnea , left base subsegmental atelectasis. ekgfirst degree av block , left axis deviation , a left ??anticular??vesicular block , no st or t-wave changes. ua with 3+ blood ,15-20 white blood cells , trace bacterial. of note , renalultrasound on 9/29/03 ( prior admission )i revealed nohydronephrosis , distended gallbladder with multiple small stones.ett mibi on 9/14/03 stress images only performed revealed smallarea of myocardial scar in mid lad/diagonal territory withmoderate stress induced peri-infarct ischemia. echo performed2/25/03 revealed an ef of 45-50% , positive lvh. inferior andlateral hypokinesis.hospital course:1. ischemia: the patient with a history of cad and positivemibi in 10/10 the patient with no ekg changes , and also nochest pain. the patient initially continued on aspirin , betablocker and a statin. on 8/25/03 the patient with a troponinleak ( peak of .84 ) which subsequently trended down. the patientalso had had a prior troponin leak prior to the previouslydescribed mibi. at that time cardiology was following andrecommended medical management secondary to difficulty withaggressive intervention in this patient. for this admission ,cardiology was again consulted and cardiology recommended doing arepeat mibi to assess. the mibi was completed on 3/28/03 andresults are pending at the time of this dictation. again , verydifficult to perform intervention secondary to habitus.continued aspirin , beta blocker and statin. to follow up withcardiology for further read of the mibi test. pump: the patientwith elevated bnp and some fluid overload. chest x-ray asdescribed above ( also a question of small pleural effusion slowlyimproved from before ). it was felt that the patient's shortnessof breath could be secondary to increased pulmonary edema. so ,the patient's lasix was increased to 80 mg p.o. t.i.d. ( fromb.i.d. dosing ). prior echo is as described above , revealing anef of 45%. the patient did have successful diuresis on theincreased lasix dosing. on 1/24 the lasix was lowered back tob.i.d. dosing since the patient's creatinine began to rise.creatinine normalized to patient's baseline on 10/14 at time ofdischarge the patient is on a home regimen of lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d. rhythm: the patient with a history of vt and the patientwas continued on sotalol , and monitored on telemetry withoutalarms.2. pulmonary: the patient with shortness of breath increasedover baseline and chest x-ray as described above. secondary tothe elevated bnp and increased lower extremity edema , the patientwas diuresed as described above. the patient does use bipap atnight for obstructive sleep apnea.3. endocrine: the patient with diabetes on insulin slidingscale and a.m. nph. no ace inhibitor was added secondary to thesignificantly elevated creatinine. the patient's nph wasincreased to 10 units q.a.m. secondary to elevated sugars( resulting in more improved glycemic control ).4. renal: the patient with chronic renal insufficiency with abaseline creatinine of approximately 4. this is likely secondaryto several factors , including diabetes , effects of paraproteinassociated with monoclonal gammopathy ( obesity ). the patient wascontinued on phoslo , calcitriol and epogen. the patient alsowith increased hematuria , and this was discussed with urology.previously extensive urological workup ( including cystoscopy ) waslargely negative but were poor studies secondary to largehabitus. urology attending was not comfortable with aggressiveintervention at this time , and thought hematuria was likelysecondary to significant bph ( and associated engorged veins ).the patient is status post targis procedure as described above ,and hematuria secondary to recent foley trauma from pastadmission. the patient to follow up with urology in the future.a urine cytology was obtained and is pending at this time.5. gi: the patient with elevated ammonia levels , with normallfts. this has also been worked up in the past according to thepatient which resulted in no clear diagnosis. the patient is tooobese for any abdominal imaging per ct. the patient does have ahistory of multiple myeloma which could be the source of elevatedammonia , versus a hepatic source. ammonium level was 83. thepatient had no asterixis and had normal mentation while inhouse.the patient's medication of lactulose was continued.6. heme: the patient with chronic anemia as described in thelab section. the patient did have an episode of epistaxis thatsubsequently resolved , and hematuria as described above , thoughalso somewhat improved at time of discharge. hematocrit wasstable throughout this , and there was no need for transfusion.7. oncology: the patient with a history of iga monoclonalgammopathy status post cytoxan therapy. the oncologistattending , dr. burrows , who knows the patient felt there wasno need for additional chemo at this time. previous cytoxantherapy has not been significantly effective.8. neuro: the patient also complaining of muscle weakness ,proximal muscles greater than distal muscles. a neurologyconsult was called , who felt that this was largely secondary todeconditioning and secondary to patient's multiple comorbidities ,this is not likely secondary to a myositis. no further workupwas performed.plan to do: the patient to be discharged to rehabilitation forfurther care , physical therapy and medical management. thepatient to follow up with cardiology , pcp and urology. continuewound care dressing changes b.i.d.discharge condition: stable.discharge medications:1. tylenol 325 p.o. q.6h p.r.n. pain.2. aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.day.3. calcitriol .75 mcg p.o. q.day.4. colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.5. doxepin 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.6. lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.7. nph 10 units subq. q.a.m.8. insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and h.s.9. atrovent two puffs inhaled b.i.d.10. lactulose 30 ml p.o. q.4h , instructions goal 4-5 soft bowelmovements per day.11. maalox 50 ml p.o. q.6h p.r.n. indigestion.12. serax 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia.13. oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.6h p.r.n. pain.14. afrin 2 sprays nasal b.i.d. p.r.n.15. senna tablets 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d.16. sodium bicarbonate 650 mg p.o. t.i.d.17. zoloft 50 mg p.o. q.day.18. proscar 5 mg p.o. q.day.19. simvastatin 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.20. sotalol 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.21. toprol xl 100 mg p.o. q.day.22. ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia.23. mirapex .5 mg p.o. t.i.d.24. fluticasone nasal spray 1-2 sprays nasally q.day.escription document: 8-6974828 dbssten teldictated by: apana , aaronattending: iles , harleydictation id 9385120d: 3/28/03t: 3/28/03
