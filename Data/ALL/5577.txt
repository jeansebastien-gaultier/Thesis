[known lastname 2479] was diagnosed with lymphoblastic lymphoma in[2116-1-31].  he presented to [hospital1 18] on [2115-12-30] withcomplaints of diffuse myalgias and arthralgias. a ct scandemonstrated multiple enlarged portahepatis lymph nodes (largest1.5 x 2.7 cm)and portacaval lymph nodes (largest 1.9 cm x 3.4 )as well as multiple mildly enlarged paraaortic lymph nodes, thelargest measuring 1.2 x 1.9cm. on [2116-1-6], he underwent act-guided fine-needle aspiration of a portahepatis lymph nodewhich was nondiagnostic.a bone marrow biopsy was obtained on [2116-2-26], demonstratinginvolvement by high-grade b-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.tumor cells were diffusely positive for pan b cell markers cd20and pax-5, with co-expression of cd10 and bcl-2.  tdt stainingwas equivocal, with predominantly cytoplasmic staining and arare cell with dim nuclear staining.  mib-1 staining showed anoverall proliferation index of 50-60%, with focal areas with ahigher fraction.  the differential diagnosis was felt to includelymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor b-celllymphoma/leukemia) or a blastic transformation/progression of amature b cell lymphoma. it was noted that a definitive diagnosiswould require flow cytometry and molecular studies, which couldnot be performed because there were no blasts in the peripheralblood and a marrow aspirate could not be obtained (dry tap).however, the peripheral blood sample was sent forimmunophenotyping, which demonstrated a new population of cd34positive cells and a small population of cd19 positive cells inthe "blast" gait, without expression of tdt.  it was felt thatthese findings should be interpreted with caution since noblasts were identified on a corresponding peripheral smear.given his significant liver dysfunction and other medicalco-morbidities, the initial treatment regimen chosen for thepatient consisted of r-chop, which was initiated on [2116-3-4].he received a second cycle of chemotherapy on [2116-3-24],consisting of r-chop without vincristine, which was heldsecondary to neuropathy. modified hyper-cvad course a was givenon [2116-4-10], with a second course given on [2116-5-15] and a thirdcourse on [2116-6-22]. course b was not given due to his history ofhepatic cirrhosis. of note, the patient has known retinalinvolvement by his lymphoma, for which he is followed by dr.[last name (stitle) ] of ophthalmology. a liver biopsy on [5-8] and repeat bonemarrow biopsies on [6-12] and [7-19] have shown no evidence ofrecurrent lymphoma.the patient presented on [2116-10-15] with myalgias, headache,mental status changes, and fevers. a cbc showed a wbc of 7.2with 14% blasts. a bone marrow biopsy demonstrated markedfibrosis and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. hewas treated with rituximab 500mg, given in three doses of 100mg,200 mg, and 200mg on [10-9] - [10-11]. in addition, he was treatedwith rituximab 375mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750mg/m2, doxorubicin20mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20mg from [10-19]- [10-21].the patient was noted to have recurrence of peripheral blasts on[2116-11-9], with a bone marrow biopsy on [2116-11-11] showing residualleukemia in the marrow. after extensive discussion, he opted tocontinue palliative chemotherapy with rituximab and prednisone.rituximab was started on [2116-11-16] at 100mg, with plans tocontinue threrapy with 200mg daily on [11-17] and [11-18].<br><b>additional medical history:</b>1.  hepatitis c, not treated.2.  hepatic cirrhosis.3.  history of intravenous drug use.4.  history of depression.5.  chronic lower back pain.6.  status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.7.  lipomectomy.8.  steroid-induced diabetes mellitussocial history:the patient is currently living with his mother and his brother,[name (ni) 2259].
