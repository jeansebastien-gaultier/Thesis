cardiomyopathysecondary diagnoses :2. dilated cardiomyopathy3. hypertension4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease5. bronchitis6. cervical polypschief complaint :the patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest 02/04/94 .she was transferred to retelk county medical center for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .patient also received aicd .history of present illness :the patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .patient 's past medical history is to besummarized as follows :in 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in hispit , delaware .since that time the patient has been treated medically .in 07/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a mbo2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .on 09/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at retelk county medical center .echocardiogram showed severe pr and mitral regurgitation , mild ai and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .consequently the patient was started on coumadin .catheterization at that time showed an ra pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , svr of 2100 and a pvr of 387 .coronaries were completely normal .consequently the patient was admitted to the ccu for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .in the ccu the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to captopril and isordil .hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a svr of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with fev1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased elcl of 50% .repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .furthermore , due to the patient 's long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .consequently the patient was discharged on captopril , digoxin , lasix , micronase , isordil and prn inhalers .the patient did well at home until 1/31/94 when she was admitted to souland in nixmont bovo with increasing congestive heart failure .at that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .by report , in the interim since discharge from retelk county medical center , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .dring this hospitalization at hahkellrick hospital , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .she was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .she was treated for a short time with lidocaine and eventually weaned off .she was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to retelk county medical center for further evaluation .the patient was transferred to retelk county medical center on 02/20/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .the patient was evaluated by the chf and heart transplant service .it was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the alllo eino hospital which recommended eps to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient 's arrhythmia with possible aicd placement if the eps was negative .note , per recommendation from the chf team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient 's hospitalization without difficulty .on 02/22/94 an eps study was performed .the patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .consequently aicd placement was recommended .consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 .note , from 02/22 to 03/09 there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the aicd .note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .thus , aicd placement was performed on 03/09/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the aicd placement .by 03/10/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the aicd placement site .at this point it was felt the patient would go home on 03/13/94 .it was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to vonamemp , la via plane by herself .this was discussed with both the patient and the cardiology b team .past medical history :type ii diabetes mellitus , cardiomyopathy , bronchitis , history of hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and cervical polyps .allergies :nkda .medications on transfer :captopril 25 mg t.i.d. , digoxin .125 mg q.d. , lasix 40 mg q.d. , isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , dobutamine 2.3 mg per kilogram per hour , xanax .25 mg prn , beclovent 2 puffs q.i.d. , proventil 2 puffs q.i.d. , k-dur 20 meq q.d. , magnesium oxide 400 mg t.i.d. and colace 100 mg b.i.d.social history :positive tobacco history although the patient quit approximately 1 year ago .history of alcohol formerly 6 pack per day long-standing , however , the patient currently does not use alcohol .the patient lives with her daughter and is unable to work .family history :positive for lung cancer and positive for hypertension .physical examination :heent :within normal limits .neck :supple with 2+ carotid pulses bilaterally , negative for bruits .jugular venous pressure approximately 8 cm , negative for lymphadenopathy .cardiovascular :regular rate and rhythm , ii / vi systolic murmur , negative for l3 .note that the s2 was greater than s1 .lungs :clear to auscultation bilaterally with an inspiratory squeak at the left lower base .abdomen :positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended , negative for hepatosplenomegaly .extremities :negative for clubbing , cyanosis or edema , and 2+ pulses throughout

0.9 .hospital course :as mentioned in the history of present illness ( inadvertently placed in the history of present illness ) , the patient was admitted for further management , and evaluation of transplantation .as per history of present illness the patient was found to be a poor heart-lung transplantation candidate .an eps study was performed which was negative for inducible arrhythmia despite maximal stimulus .consequently , the patient underwent aicd placement on 03/09/94 .hospital course was only complicated by presumed right forearm thrombophlebitis , and the patient completed a 2 week antibiotic course prior to aicd placement .note , for the question of the right forearm thrombophlebitis , the right forearm was debrided and sent for culture and pathology .cultures were negative .debridement was negative for purulent discharge .pathology is only significant for inflammation , and not infection .the patient did well following the aicd placement .there were no intraoperative complications , and no postoperative complications .disposition :the patient is discharged to home in stable condition on 03/13/94 .medications on discharge :at the time of discharge ,
