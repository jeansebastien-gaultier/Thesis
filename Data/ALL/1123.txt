3 to 7 red cells and 1 + grams. kub showed a large amountof stool in the large bowel , no free air , a few air fluid levels ,overall picture was not consistent with small bowel obstruction.the patient was admitted with a question of gastroenteritis vs.partial small bowel obstruction , which would be early. she wasadmitted and kept npo for bowel rash to receive the iv fluids. nong tube was placed. on hospital day one , the patient wascomplaining of abdominal crampiness and feeling nauseated. she hada small amount of emesis. she had spiked a temperature of 101.2.this was felt to still either be consistent with the flu , or ileus.a fever work up was then begun. she had blood cultures that weresent , repeat kub and a repeat cbc. by the afternoon , the patientwas feeling a little bit better.her

glucose of 107. her kub and upright that was repeated stillshowed a large amount of stool in the large bowel , few air fluidlevels but no change from the earlier exam.on hospital day three , the patient's fever curve had improved. thecultures that were previously sent were no growth so far and theseremained negative throughout the course of the hospitalization. shewas tolerating clears over the course of the morning. however ,later on in the day , her pain returned , mainly in the right upperquadrant , right lower quadrant. at this point , the decision wasmade to check a ct scan. of note , when the patient was admitted andhad a temperature spike , she was placed on stress post steroidsgiven her history of prednisone. this was maintained throughouther hospitalization.her ct scan showed that there was contrast seen through the smallbowel and colon to the rectum. there was a small section of smallbowel with wall thickening at the paraumbilical level with fluidaround it and no absence of small bowel obstruction. no edema inthe colon , with a small amount of free fluid around the liver andthe pericolic gutters. this raised concern although these findingscould be consistent with small bowl obstruction , to erase concernabout ischemia. however , the patient's exam had improvedremarkably by the morning of the 4 of april her abdomen was soft , withactive bowel sounds and the patient was only mildly tender. giventhat the exam was not quite consistent with the ct readings , otherthings were considered in the differential. of note , the patienthad a couple of loose stools and stool cultures were sent. he doeshave a history of salmonella in the past. these cultures werenegative and included ssyc and c. diff.the concern was raised on the 14 of may that if this was not consistentwith ischemic bowel , that perhaps this was an exacerbation of hervasculitis and could represent vasculitic changes in her smacirculation which had improved because the patient was placed onstress post steroids. an angiogram was performed and the findingswere as followed: the aortoiliac artery and sma were normal inappearance. there was no evidence of microaneurysm , narrowing ordilation. because of these findings , it was felt that this wasnot a picture consistent with vasculitis. she was switched fromher hydrocortisone to her usual prednisone dose of 10 mg. q d onthe 1 of january , the day prior to discharge.the patient did well overnight , tolerated clears in the morning ,and by lunch time , was able to eat a full diet. of note , thepatient the night prior to discharge , had a complaint of some calfpain which was transient in nature. however , although her exam wasunremarkable , lower extremity noninvasives were done and these werenegative. so the patient is being discharged home in goodcondition. she is tolerating a regular diet.medications on discharge: include insulin , procardia xl 60 mg. qd , axid 150 mg. bid , prednisone 10 mg.q d.dictated by:
