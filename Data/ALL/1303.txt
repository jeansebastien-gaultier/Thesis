the patient is a 37 year old womanwith dilated cardiomyopathy admittedwith positional chest pain associated with viral prodrome. pastmedical history revealed the patient was diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy in 10-89. she was worked up at the ingvid's health services with a conclusion of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ,work-up unavailable. the patient was discharged on lasix , digoxinand an ace inhibitor. in 15 of april , the patient was admitted to orecross medical center after complaining of positional chest pain ,shortness of breath and fatigue. she was diagnosed with dilatedcardiomyopathy and received an echocardiogram , which revealed largeventricles , 2+ mitral regurgitation , 3+ tricuspid regurgitation. in23 of june , the patient underwent a bicycle exercise tolerance test andendured 10 minutes and 16 seconds , limited by fatigue. peak heartrate was 104 , peak blood pressure was 156/80 , she had a few atrialpremature beats and no ischemic st-t changes. her oxygen uptakewas 16.2 milliliters per kilogram per minute. in 24 of november , the patientunderwent right ventriculogram which showed ejection fraction 24%and global hypokinesis. on the day of admission , on 11 of january , thepatient complained of 4 days of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting andmalaise , followed by sharp severe chest pain in the mid chest belowthe left breast radiating to the back , which was relieved by lyingon the left and aggravated by leaning forward or lying on theright , also worsened by deep breathing and cough , and also withventral palpation. the patient claimed that the pain had nevergone away in the past 12 hours , but again was aggravated by certainpositions. past medical history was significant forcardiomyopathy , hypertension , gastritis , ex-intravenous drug abuserfor 10 years , anemia , and recent crack cocaine use. medications onadmission included lasix , enalapril and digoxin. allergies were noknown drug allergies.physical examination: the patient was an obese black woman in noapparent distress. blood pressure was162/100 , heart rate 90 , respiratory rate 24 , oxygen saturation 99% ,no pulsus. eyes were pupils were equal , round , reactive to light ,extraocular movements intact , muddy sclera. neck was supple ,jugular venous pressure was 8 to 10 centimeters , carotids were 2+bilaterally. lungs were clear to auscultation and percussionexcept for a few bibasilar crackles. heart showed normal s1 ands2 , no rubs , distant heart sounds , no murmurs were noted. abdomenwas obese , soft , normal bowel sounds , she was

, chloride92 , bicarbonate 37 , blood urea nitrogen 7 ,creatinine .9 , glucose 159 , ast 58 , creatinine phosphokinase 641 ,with 23% myocardial bands. white count was 4.6 , hematocrit 31.5 ,platelets 166 , 000 , esr 60 , prothrombin time 11.3 , partialthromboplastin time 18. chest x-ray showed a big heart with mildcongestive heart failure. the electrocardiogram showed t-waveinversions in i , ii , f , l , v2 through v6 , consistent with a 1990electrocardiogram done when she was complaining of positional chestpain similar to the chest pain she is having now.hospital course: the patient was admitted with the thought thather history was consistent with pericarditis , butwas also worriesome for ischemia given her elevated creatininephosphokinase with myocardial band fraction of 23 , and her historyof cocaine abuse. her hospital course was consistent withcontinuation of her pain through the first day of hospitalizationdespite and aggressive anti-ischemic regimen. it was found thathermyocardial band electrophoresis showed no myocardial bandfraction detected , and it was decided that we would shift ourtherapy to a more anti-inflammatory regimen to control herpericarditis. at that time , indocin was started and the chest painresolved. with the resolution of her chest pain , the t-waveinversions corrected. the patient was transerred to the floor onindocin 50 milligrams 3 times a day , aspirin , bactrim , enalapriland carafate and remained without chest pain for the next 2 days.she was also seen by the ace team in consultation about her drugand alcohol problem , and it
