hospital with severe pancreatitis andrespiratory failure requiring intubation. history was obtainedfrom family and the medical record.two days prior to admission, pt began experiencing sharp ruqpain, nausea, nonbloody, nonbilious vomitus and diarrhea. thefamily denies any fevers, cough or chills and states she was inher normal state of health prior to developing pain. she did notwant to go see her md, but one day prior to transfer her painworsened and she finally went to [hospital6 ].  atlgh intital labs were notable for a lipase of 2254 which trendedupward to 8117, normal cr and wbc of 22. initial bun was 22 butsubsequently trended upward to 30. ruq us revealed common bileduct dilitation and an abnormal appearance of her pancreas. shewas given metronidazole and levofloxacin and admitted to thegeneral medical floor where she was kept npo and given ivf. ctscan of her abdomen and pelvis was performed and was concerningfor necrosis, therefore were was transferred to the icu whereaggressive fluid repletion was initiated (at the time oftransfer she has recieved 7 l. hct demonstratedhemoconcentration (54) which remained stable despite fluids.antitbiotics were broadened to imipenem. she remainedhemodynamically stable, afebrile, with uop of 60 cc/hrovernight.initial plan was for ercp however the afternoon of transfer thepatient developed an acute desaturation event to

[2141-6-23], she wastransfered back to the icu, re-intubated for hypoxia thought tobe due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions and aquestionable infarct in the [date range ] without thrombus, which was notanticoagulated. on [2141-6-24], she was noted to have arf with rareeos (ain), which was thought to be due to medications/contrastdye exposure. several potential offending agents

pancreatitis: resolved. mostlikely gallstone pancreatitis though lft pattern not c/wprolonged obstruction. imaging at outside hospital demonstratedthe presence of stones in addition to common bile ductdilitation. she was initially treated with meropenem  which wasdiscontinued after several days. surgery and ercp services wereconsulted and suggested supportive medical management ofpancreatitis. ercp was deferred during acute disease state giventhat no obstructing stones were identified on ct and ruq u/s.after acute disease state resolves, she will require lapcholecystectomy or ercp with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).#. hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: resolved. initialepisode of respiratory failure was thought to be due to ards, aswell as bilateral effusions and some vascular congestion,suggesting volume overload in the setting of aggressive volumeresuscitation. after pt's pancreatitis started to improve, shewas aggressively diuresed and weaned off of sedation and theventilator. she did not have a cuff [last name (lf) 3564], [first name3 (lf) ] she was givensteroids for 24hrs and was ultimately extubated.after extubation, pt was called out to general medical floor on[6-23]. within 24hrs, she developed worsening mental status andincreased work of breathing. she was found to be hypercarbic onabg. despite aggressive diuresis and a trial of bipap, pt's co2did not improve, so she was re-intubated in the [hospital unit name 153]. afterintubation, a bronchoscopy was performed that did not reveal anyevidence of lobar infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pna.bal cx was negative. a cta was performed that revealed relative[name (ni) 20534] of [name (ni) ] consistent with ischemic changes, but nothrombus was identified. lenis were performed and did notdemonstrate any evidence of clot and echo did not show rightheart strain. she was also noted to have persistent bilateralpleural effusions. due to the fact that no definitive clot wasfound and she clinically improved, a decision was made to notanticoagulate. she was extubated on [2141-6-28], and approximately15min after, she developed stridor and increased wob. she wastreated with steroids, racemic epinephrine and heliox forpresumed laryngeal edema. after several hours her respiratorystatus improved and within 24 hrs she was weaned to nasalcannula. chest x-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusiondespite persistent ataelectasis. on discharge she wascomfortable at rest and with ambulation on room air.#. ventilator associated pneumonia: on [2141-6-20], she developedworsening fevers and increased sputum production. other sourcesof infection were investigated (normal u/a, abdomen imagingunchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for vapwith vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin. pt completed a 8 daytreatment course for vap. no current evidence of infectiousprocess#. acute renal failure: thought to be ain after being exposed tocipro and zosyn, both of which can cause ain. renal u/s wasperformed and did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis. pt'scr continued to improve (last 1.2) and she continued to havegood urine output.#. tachycardia: improved with treatment of acute disease andwith restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (pcp confirmedthat both are for hypertension).#. insomnia/delerium: was previously on olanzapine for steroidvs. icu induced delerium. she responded well however complainedof increased insomnia. olanzapine was discontinued and trazodonewas ordered.#. diabetes: she has had fluctuating blood sugars. initialhyperglycemia treated with ssi and lantus resulted in next dayhypoglycemia. resolution of hypoglycemia achieved with d5w andholding insulin. hyperglycemic again on [2141-7-2] with glucose in400s. she was continued on gentle hiss while npo. she wasultimately transition back to glargine and hiss. the diabetesservice saw the patient and also adjusted her insulin dosing.#. hypertension,
