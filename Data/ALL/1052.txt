illness: this is a 63 year-old male with ahistory of peripheral vasculardisease , hypertension , non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,coronary artery disease , aortic stenosis , and status post bilaterallower extremity bypass grafts who presented to the hospital withincreasing left lower extremity pain. he was taken to angiographyat which time tpa infusion was commenced. he is most recentlystatus post a left femoral to peroneal bypass graft in july of2001 and has noticed that , in the past two to three weeks , has beendeveloping increasing rest pain and coolness to the left foot tothe point where he was not able to ambulate. in angiography , hewas found to have an occlusion of the left lower extremity veingraft in the area of the mid-thigh with no passage of contrast andminimal reconstitution of collaterals to his foot.past medical history: peripheral vascular disease. myocardialinfarction. hypertension. non-insulindependent diabetes mellitus. aortic stenosis. he is status post aleft femoral to peroneal bypass graft in july of 2001. a revisionwith cephalic vein to dorsalis pedis in july of 2001. he isstatus post a right femoral to peroneal in september of 2000 and a rightfourth toe amputation in september of 2000.medications: glipizide 5 mg b.i.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 50 mgq.d. , lisinopril 20 mg q.d. , simvastatin 20 mg q.d. ,amlodipine 5 mg q.d. , imdur 30 mg q.d. , and toprol 100 mg q.d. andenteric coated aspirin.allergies: no known drug allergies.hospital course: the patient first underwent angiography at whichtime they found that the vein graft was occluded.he underwent tpa treatment and was brought back to angiography.this time they did not find necessarily any improvement. theconduit actually opened but it was found that he does have a highgrade anastomotic stricture of the distal anastomosis. he wastaken to the operating room on 10/23/01 for a left lower extremitythrombectomy via groin and foot cutdown. status post thatprocedure he developed symptoms of acute chest pain andhypotension. an ecg was performed , as well as troponin drawn ,revealing that he has an acute myocardial infarction. thecardiology service was called and the patient was admittedpost-thrombectomy to the cardiac care unit. at that time he wasmanaged medically for a few days. based on his severe aorticstenosis and difficulty in managing his blood pressure , the cardiacsurgery service was consulted. he was scheduled to see cardiacsurgery in office setting but , given his current condition , we weregoing to perform his surgery a little bit sooner. he did have about of pneumonia which mildly delayed his surgery.on 1/18/02 he underwent catheterization which revealed a rightdominant system , a discreet 40% lesion in the proximal left main , adiscreet 30% lesion in the proximal left anterior descendingartery , 100% lesion in the first marginal branch of the leftcircumflex artery , as well as 100% lesion in the second marginalbranch of the left circumflex artery. he has a discreet 80% lesionin the proximal right coronary artery , as well as evidence ofsevere aortic stenosis. during catheterization this revealed an rapressure of 10 , a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/20 , with wedge of31. he had a thick cardiac output of 4.77 and cardiac index of2.1.based on the findings of these catheterization results , the patientwas taken to the operating room on 2/13/02 with dr. opfer and dr.gack for an aortic valve replacement with a #23carpentier-edwards pericardial valve and mitral valvuloplasty withan alfieri suture repair , as well as coronary artery bypass grafttimes three with left internal mammary artery to the left anteriordescending artery , left radial to obtuse marginal one , and leftradial to posterior descending artery. postoperatively heunderwent our routine care and went to the cardiac surgicalintensive care unit where he generally did well.he remained on his aspirin and lopressor , as well as coumadin. hewas mildly tachycardic and his lopressor dose was adjusted.because of his diabetes mellitus , he was placed on the portlandprotocol and remained on a full ten-day course of flagyl andcefotaxime for his preoperative pneumonia. on postoperative day #1he was transferred to the floor where he did well and was able toambulate at least to a chair and was deemed that he probably is nota candidate to go home immediately but a candidate forrehabilitation. he has been taken off his portland protocol andhis staples have been discontinued.on his pre-discharge examination he is stable with clean incisions ,as well as stable sternum. he is now currently on room air andwill be discharged to rehabilitation.disposition: discharge medications: coumadin 4 mg p.o. q.hs tomaintain inr between 2 and 3 , aspirin
