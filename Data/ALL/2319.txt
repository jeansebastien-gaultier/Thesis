problems :hyponatremia .hypokalemia .history of present illness :the patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the middso memorial hospital emergency room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .during the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .she felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .in the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .the patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .the patient was subsequently transferred to the micu on dopamine for further management .past medical history :only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida v , para v .medications on admission :none .allergies :no known drug allergies .social history :the patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .she also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .she is married and lives with her husband .family history :notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .physical examination :the patient was an agitated elderly white female .temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .heent :showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .extraocular muscles intact .oropharynx benign .eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .carotids were 2+ .no palpable thyroid .lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .cardiac exam revealed s1 , s2 with an intermittent s4 without murmur or rubs .abdominal exam was benign .extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .neurologic exam :the patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .light touch was intact .admission labs :sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , bun 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .platelets 310 .pt and ptt were normal .lft &apos;s were within normal limits .admission cortisol , aldosterone , b12 and folate and tsh were drawn .chest x-ray on transfer to the micu showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .hospital course :in the micu , the patient initially required dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .the patient had a swan-ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .because the swan-ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with cefotaxime , gentamicin and flagyl .all cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an e coli uti .the infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .the patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .because addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose cortisone .however , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .the patient also responded appropriately to cortrosyn stimulation test .also , tsh was normal on admission .thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on dopamine was subsequently abnormal .however , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .the patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .emg showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .additional studies also included a head ct that showed a small lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head mri .other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .lh and ssh levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .galactin levels were within normal limits .ana was negative .ace level was negative .heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .an anti-yo ri and who antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .on hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off dopamine and was transferred to the floor .at that time , the stress dose hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .in the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .the patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .because of the patient &apos;s significant smoking history , chest pt was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .however , the chest ct showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .the patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest ct included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest ct would be best evaluated as an out-patient .a new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .she will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .medications on discharge :prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .multi-vitamin one p.o. q day .condition on discharge :stable .disposition :the patient will be discharged to home .she will follow-up with jacrendonate sella , m.d. on 8/6/95 .she will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .at the time of discharge , studies that were pending included a repeat thyroid function panel , aldosterone levels and anti-who and anti-yo and ri antibodies .dictated by :gi sella , m.d. au33attending :oghan r. rourlf , m.d. rg9 reviewed on computer without chart sv763/1101batch :4968index no. 7kopph598fd :07/20/95t :07/22/95
