r wave progression. compared to the previous tracingof [2189-8-27] the sinus rate is much faster. the other findings aresimilar.-[9-12] cxr: no gross pulmonary process noted. if clinicallyfeasible, consider repeat study once patient is able to toleratethe procedure.-[9-12] ct abd/pelvis: 1. no acute intra-abdominal or pelvicprocess to explain the patient's symptoms.  2. status post orthotopic liver transplant with diffuseanasarca. knownportal vein thrombus is not well evaluated on the current study.  3. trace pleural effusions and minimal atelectasis.  4. unchanged 8 mm left renal stone.-[9-12] ct head 1. stable appearance of the brain without evidenceof an acute intracranial abnormality.2. the partially imaged orogastric tube appears to make a loopin thenasopharynx.-[9-12] abdominal u/s: limited study as above with persistent mainportal vein thrombosis and no evidence of intrahepatic portalvein flow, similar to [2189-8-27].-[9-21] renal u/s: 8-mm left renal calculus within the lowerpole, unchanged from ct scan of [2189-9-12]. no evidence ofhydronephrosis or obstruction.-[9-23] ct chest/abd/pelvis: 1. bilateral, multifocalconsolidative airspace opacities. these have progressed comparedto recent chest radiographs, and are new compared to [2189-9-12] ct of the abdomen and pelvis (when the lung bases wereimaged). this most likely represents multifocal pneumonia.aspiration and a component of pulmonary edema could also beconsidered. clinical correlation is advised.2. malpositioned left upper extremity picc, with tip extendinginto the right ventricle. this should be withdrawn for optimalpositioning.3. findings compatible with anemia.4. large pulmonary artery compatible with pulmonaryhypertension.5. status post liver transplantation. there is small ascites anddiffuseanasarca, a distended ivc, and mild cardiomegaly, all compatiblewith fluid overload.6. 11-mm non-obstructing left renal stone.7. no retroperitoneal hematoma or other source of blood loss, asquestioned.-[9-23] ct head: 1. study limited by motion shows no largeintracranial hemorrhage or other obvious acute intracranialabnormality.  2. persistent catheter fragment seen to course from one sideof nasal cavity to the other on prior ct of [2189-9-12]; clinicalcorrelation recommended.-[9-26] ruq u/s: limited evaluation with the main portal veinagain notvisualized. however, flow appears present in the left hepaticvein and left hepatic artery. abdominal ascites.-[9-27] abd x-ray: no evidence for obstruction; ng tube in place.brief hospital course:the patient was initially admitted to micu [location (un) ] for severeencephalopathy requiring intubation in the ed for airwayprotection. she was treated for hepatic encephalopathy, withlactulose and rifaximin. initial cultures revealedcarbapenemase-resistant e.coli, for which she was initiallytreated with nitrofurantoin and amikacin. nitrofurantoin wassubsequently discontinued. per id recommendations, antibioticswere changed to colistin, then ultimately to tetracycline. shewas weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to theinternal medicine service on [9-16]. her lactulose dose wasincreased. her renal function worsened, which was believedlikely due to nephrotoxic medications. she was also started onoctreotride, midodrine and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome. sewas transferred back to micu green on [9-19] for worseningencephalopathy and labs consistent with low-grade dic, includinga ten point hematocrit drop, thrombocytopenia, worseningcoagulation studies, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. hematologywas consulted and agreed with diagnosis of dic. over thesubsequent days, the patient required large amounts of bloodproducts, including red blood cells, platelets, cryoprecipitate,and fresh frozen plasma. despite these measures, she still hadlarge amounts of bloody output from her rectal tube; she wasfelt too unstable to undergo any gi procedures, and was treatedwith further blood transfusions. her significant hypernatremiaand hypercalcemia improved to some degree during her stay in themicu. the patient's mental status did not improve, and she wasreintubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, which was partiallydue to a new pneumonia. her mental status was sufficiently poorthat she only required intermittent sedation for herendotracheal tube. she had high residuals through her og tube,and tube feeds frequently had to be held. she had frequentbloody secretions from her endotracheal tube; bronchoscopyrevealed diffuse oozing of blood throughout her bronchi.multiple family meetings were held, including a meeting with thepatient's primary hepatologist, who confirmed that the patientwas not a candidate for retransplantation. as the patient'sliver disease was believed to be a central factor in herdeteriorating condition, measures were transitioned towardsmaking the patient comfortable and prolonging her life only longenough for her family members to be able to say goodbye. shepassed away peacefully with her family at her side.medications on admission:lactulose 30cc tidatovaquone 750 mg/5 ml 10cc dailycitalopram 20 mg
