cc:  chest painhpi:for full details, please see sdu admission note of 3/22/64 and sdu transfer note of 3/25/64.  in brief, the patient is a 81 y/o man with cri, type ii dm and hypertension who was in his usoh until thursday evening, when he developed substernal chest pain around 7pm, associated with dyspnea, but no  radiation diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  the pain lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.  ems was called, who brought him to the hcc ed, where he was found to be tachypneic, with an o2 of 85%.  his pain was alleviated with iv ntg, and bipap improved his o2 saturation.  he was found to have an interventricular conduction delay and a positive troponin.  he was begun on aspirin, lopressor, lasix, heparin, and integrelin and sent to the cath lab, where he was found to have 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous interventions.  he was sent to the sdu, where he was started on lasix 60iv bid and a cabg pre-op workup was begun.  since admission to the sdu, he has been stable, with excellent ra sats.  his troponin-t peaked at 2.91 and was slow to return to normal, 2.65 on last draw today. he was diuresed aggressively and transferred to the floor with no oxygen requirement, having no chest pain.	on the floor, he was stable but had a 15-beat self-limited run of mmvt, his bp was 110/60 and he was asymptomatic, with no chest pain or dyspnea.  he was given 4 gm iv of mgso4, 60 meq of kcl.  repeat cardiac enzymes drawn at the time were significant for a troponin-t of 3.73 but with a ck of 133 (303) and ck-mb of 5.2 (16.2).  past medical history:   cadchf- ef
