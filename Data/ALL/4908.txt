                                           mrn: 26649180                                                             dear dr. nunes: thank you for asking me to see mr. craft. patient says he was diagnosed as having neuropsychiatric lupus in 2103 at the vermilion hospital by dr. parker xian and was treated with steroids at the time. it's not clear what cns or neuropsychiatric manifestation he had at the time. because of complex partial seizures he was seen by dr. arce at the livingstone homes who referred him to dr. hoffman at the livingstone homes who said that his estradiol level was in the 80s. his testosterone was up but available testosterone was down so he was put on clomid and testolactone which he said turned off the lupus and turned off his seizures. said he was doing fine until around 2 weeks ago when he felt that his lupus recurred. he said his neck felt full and warm. his head felt like it was going to explode. he had tinnitus, excess saliva, he felt that his lower jaw was vibrating and when he lay on his pillow his neck felt like it wasn't right. also about the time he developed a cold with runny nose and postnasal drip. lab work on february 8 showed a normal cbc, urine, and anti-dna (in 2103 his ana was positive at 1:1024 but i don't have any other results). he's had no fevers, no rashes other than a folliculitis on his legs. no new problem with head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, teeth or gum except that he has to wear his glasses. recently had some teeth removed. has a postnasal drip with a little bit of a cough. no other cardiorespiratory problems but takes altace for mild hypertension. no gi problems. has urinary frequency due to nocturia ever 2 hours, due to benign prostatic hypertrophy and recently had a tur. dr. nunes re:  craft, lloyd

venom. has a past history of diagnosis of gout versus pseudogout. sleeps fine. no history of fractures. only operation is a total knee replacement on the left for arthritis and appendectomy. bruises easily, frequently has headaches. has been diagnosed as being bipolar. exercises. recent mri consistent with a "vasculopathy." family history. mother died of colon cancer at 62, smoked. father died at 62 of heart attack, stroke and insulin dependent diabetes, also smoked. he is an only child. social history. doesn't smoke. when he's depressed he becomes a binge drinker. exercises when he's not depressed. he's retired since 2103. was a stage manager. physical exam. somewhat overweight gentleman. blood pressure was 160/80. pulse was 88 and regular. skin, a hint of livedo reticularis on forearms, and a couple of infected hair follicles around his knees. one small node in the left side of his neck. mouth and throat was clear. bilateral nasal polyp more on the right than left. ear drums fine. hearing fine (tuning fork in the middle of the forehead was heard in the forehead). chest clear. no cva tenderness. heart: no murmurs. abdomen, no organs, masses, tenderness but obese. extremity, joint exam fine. neurological fine. i do not think that his lupus has acted up but think most of his current symptoms could be explained by an upper respiratory tract infection. however, i suspect he might have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and therefore have tested him for that, and also for complement level to also exclude lupus and vasculitis. basically i told him to take flonase twice a day until his ringing in the ear cleared up and postnasal drip cleared up.  in the meantime continue on the lamictal 100 mg twice a day as a stabilizer, risperdal 0.25 mg per day as a mood stabilizer, the testolactone 50 mg 4 times a day to increase the availability of testosterone, the clomid (clomiphene citrate) 50 mg per day to decrease estradiol, levoxyl 50 mcg twice a day, altace 10 mg twice a day regarding hypertension, and ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day for low back pain. patient also gave me 2 pages of notes similar to what he had including comments regarding increased appetite, decreased memory, dr. nunes re:  craft, lloyd                             mrn: 26649180                        february 17, 2114page 3  decreased cognitive function, decreased balance, fatigue, decreased hearing, a history of carotid sinus, hypersensitivity, question of cholinergic transmission problems. also should be noted that a lot of his symptoms coincided with taking aricept to improve his memory. took it for 10 days and hasn't taken it for 2 weeks but his symptoms persisted.  thank you again for asking me to see him. please let me know if i can be of further assistance.  sincerely yours,   richard aviles, m.d. ps: if you could give me some information of what evidence there was that he had systemic lupus and neuropsychiatric lupus back in 2103 at the vermilion hospital, for instance the discharge summary from the vermilion hospital, that would be appreciated.  jp:bt:6157                                       dd:2-17-2114
