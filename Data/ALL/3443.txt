.associated diagnosis :coronary artery disease , hypertension .special procedures and operations :3-17-94 , implantation of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator .other procedures :3-11-94 , right heart cardiac catheterization with comprehensive electrophysiology study and radio frequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia .doctors discharge orders :zestril 5 mg po q.day , nitropatch .2 mg once daily , sotalol 120 mg po b.i.d. , lasix 20 mg po b.i.d. , coumadin as directed .history of present illness :the patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .he had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .he presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in december , 1994 and was admitted to tecal galecounxopt community hospital .the coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .an echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .he had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .after the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface qrs configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .the patient was discharged while on procainamide and coumadin .on march 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .the patient was admitted to an outside hospital in xingwa moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .the tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .the patient was transferred to tecal galecounxopt community hospital for further evaluation .past medical history :the past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .physical examination :on admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .his blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .the carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .the jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .cardiovascular exam :normal sl and s2 .the abdomen was benign .extremities :no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .laboratory data :the chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .hospital course :the patient was admitted to the step down unit .the patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .on march 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .during the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .after mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .after radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .however , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .the patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .on march 17 , the patient was taken to the pacemaker laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( cpi endotak c 0074 ) was placed .then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a ventak prx model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .the patient &apos;s postoperative course was uneventful .on march 19 , the patient was taken back to the electrophysiology laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .this was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .for tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .for tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .for tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .vvi pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .the patient felt good on the morning of march 20 .the patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .he will have his prothrombin time checked on monday and will follow up with the defibrillator clinic .ann breuna , m.d.dictating for :iceca back , m.d.tr :od / bmotdd :3-20-94td :03/23/94cc :
