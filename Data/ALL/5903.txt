now resolved after iv hydration..#hypotension: likely hypovolemia due to dehydration fromdiuretic use and drinking of etoh at home. pt did not have anyinfectious symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis or otherlocalizing symptoms. hypotension resolved with 2l ivf. ekg notsuggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative. tshand cortisol not pursued as pt's symptoms resolved after ivfluids. however, bp still ranged at times from high 90's-110'sand pt was asymptomatic and ambulating without dizziness ordifficulty. orthostatics were negative after iv hydration. pt'slasix, spironolactone, hctz, and [last name (un) ] were held during admissionas well as tamsulosin. he was advised to continue to hold thesemedications upon discharge. carvedilol was restarted. echo wasrepeated to ensure that cardiac function had not worsened andwas found to be similiar to prior with ef 20-25%. pt will bedischarged on half dose of his valsartan 80mg daily.++could have been due to increased etoh prior to admit. pt didnot have any suggestion of etoh withdrawal during admission andit did not appear that drinking etoh is the norm for thepatient, but that he had more drinks than normal weekend priorto admission. however, he should be continually advised torefrain from excess etoh given his chf. pt did not display signsof clinical chf during admission..#acute on chronic renal failure-presented with
