was a 34 year old gentleman with no significant past medical history except for a history of of intravenous drug abuse .he was status post a rehabilitation hospitalization at the raya ma den erinmarg hospital with a recent recrudescence of his drug abuse .he was admitted to the sephsandpot center on the morning of 4/9 and was subsequently transferred to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital for further care .the patient was apparently well until one day prior to admission .his family reports that he had worked that day .he relates using large doses of cocaine and heroin early in the morning on the day of admission .at 3:00 a.m. on the day of admission he was found by the emergency medical technicians " crawling on all fours " , confused , and combative outside his home .he gave an equivocal history of fevers and chills on the days prior to admission .bystanders report that he was assaulted about 20 minutes earlier and the nature of the assault was not known .he was taken to the sephsandpot center where he was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 105/85 , tachycardic with a heart rate to 186 , aneuric , hyperthermic , with a temperature to 105 degrees f , and progressively more confused .his chest x-ray was clear .he was treated with dopamine for hypertension and inderal for tachycardia .he received two amps of narcan .he received one gram of ceftriaxone intravenously after blood cultures were drawn .his initial arterial blood gas at the sephsandpot center revealed a p02 of 76 , pc02 14 , and a ph of 7.44 on room air .he was then transferred via med flight to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .he denied any history of recent travel .toxicology screen at sephsandpot center revealed cocaine and quinine .shortly after his arrival to that hospital he had been intubated for a respiratory rate of 60 .he required medical paralysis for this .he was reported to have a seizure , although the nature of this was unclear , and received valium for this .past medical history :none .past surgical history :he is status post recent left knee surgery , status post left carpal tunnel release .medications on admission :his meds on transfer to fih were levophed ,

following a 3 liter bolus for hypotension .no effusion or rub was heard .the cardiac exam showed point of maximal impulse was not displaced , regular rate and rhythm with normal s1 , s2 , no s3 or s4 , a grade ii / vi systolic murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border without radiation , likely representing a flow murmur .no peripheral edema was noted .the jugular venous pressure was not assessed secondary to cervical collar being in place .the carotid pulses were brisk bilaterally .the vascular exam showed normal pulses bilaterally without bruits .the abdomen was soft , bowel sounds of normal character , and there was mild percussion tenderness and tenderness to modest palpation in all four quadrants .it was unclear whether this was due to superficial tenderness or abdominal tenderness .he had marked voluntary guarding without rigidity and no masses were felt .the genitourinary exam showed normal penis with normal testicles which were nontender .there was no urethritis , no balinitis , normal prostate , nontender .there was tan guaiac positive stool with no masses .the musculoskeletal exam showed well developed , symmetrical muscular development with no fasciculations

.the cranial nerves ii-xii grossly intact , bilaterally symmetric .the motor exam-moves all four extremities easily and on command .the sensory exam revealed no focal deficits to limited exam .reflexes were trace in the upper extremities and absent in the knees with downgoing toes bilaterally .laboratory data :on admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , bun 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .the sgot was 994 , ldh 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. the white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .the mcv is 88 .the prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .the urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , ph 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 rbcs and 3-5 wbcs .the ck was 17,890 with 0.6% mb .the urine sodium was 147 .the serum toxicology was positive for cocaine on admission to the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital as well as the sephsandpot center .the electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged qt at 0.572 .an i-head ct revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .the abdominal ct revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .hospital course :the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of cocaine intoxication .he was accepted at the vo yd burgsygu hospital center intensive care unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .1-rhabdomyolysis .the patient had massive cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .this resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .the patient 's creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative mb percentages .the aldolase was positive at 142 .this was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .the patient 's urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .the patient 's urine output was further augmented by adding dopamine .nevertheless , the patient 's renal failure continued to progress .over the course of the hospitalization his ck fell in the serum .much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .2-renal failure .the creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .the urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a tenckhoff catheter was placed by drs. freierm , le , and round .subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .he continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .3-disseminated intravascular coagulation .on admission the patient 's prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .he went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .the patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .his dic was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .4-septic shock .the patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .he was maintained variously on levophed , dobutamine , dopamine , and ultimately epinephrine for blood pressure support .hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .he had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .this will be discussed below .further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .an echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .his ejection fraction was 55% .on 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an svr of 5.8 .5-hepatic failure .his sgpt on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .he had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .he was seen in consultation by the gi service and the liver transplantation service .given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .6-cocaine intoxication .serum cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the fairm of ijordcompmac hospital .further , at ceanotsit ortgold center his serum toxicology screens were positive .this is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .7-pneumonia .the patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .the first was acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin .he subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .he was seen in consultation by the infectious disease service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .8-pancreatitis .the amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .9-catheter tip infections .the patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .these were treated with vancomycin .10-anemia .the patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .11-coma .the patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .a ct scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .the lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy .the patient was treated empirically with nafcillin and ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .the patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .discharge diagnosis :cocaine intoxication , rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septic shock , hepatic failure , pneumonia , pancreatitis , catheter tip infection , anemia , coma .principal procedure :peritoneal dialysis catheter placement , peritoneal dialysis , arterial catheterization , venous catheterization , continuous mechanical ventilation , and parenteral nutrition .complications during admission :neck hematoma secondary to pulmonary artery line placement requiring transfusion , catheter tip infection .medications on discharge :none .condition on discharge :the patient was discharged to samfer street with no autopsy .lenni head , m.d.tr :be / bmotdd
