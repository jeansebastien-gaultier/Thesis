course:  the plan was for a right hemicolectomy. thepatient tolerated the procedure well, however, on transfer tothe floor from the post anesthesia care unit, the patient wasfound to be unresponsive and almost apneic.  on workup, shewas found to be hypercarbic which was presumed to be mostlikely due to narcotics from her epidural.  the epidural wasimmediately capped and an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray weredone which were essentially within normal limits.  once theepidural was capped, the patient's respiratory rate increasedto 30 and she was saturating 91% on 50%.  she had bilateralcrackles at the bases and was tachycardic.she was brought to the post anesthesia care unit for morefrequent and closer monitoring.  her narcotics and epiduralwere stopped.  the patient was closely monitored and heroxygen saturations came up, however, she continued to haverespiratory difficulty and, on repeat blood gases althoughthere was some improvement, she was found to be acidotic andstill hypercarbic and breathing with difficulty.hence, after supportive therapy was maintained for a coupleof hours, the decision was made to intubate the patient andtransfer to the intensive care unit.  she was extubated onthe following day, postoperative day two, toleratedextubation well.she had a slight temperature of 101.7 and remained slightlytachycardic but that was her baseline and her
